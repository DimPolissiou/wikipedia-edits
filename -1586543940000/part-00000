Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that may help pull fastened materials together and  prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.\n\n==Explanation==\nA screw is a combination of [[simple machines]]\u2014it is in essence an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge in the form of the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a ''female thread'' (internal thread), often in the form of a nut, or object that has the internal thread formed into it.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.\n\n[[File:Wood screw with legend.svg|thumb|A wood screw: a) head; b) non-threaded shank; c) threaded shank; d) tip.]]\n\nA screw will usually have a ''head'' on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include [[screwdriver]]s and [[wrench]]es. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a ''[[bearing surface]]''. There are exceptions. Carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven.  [[Set screw]]s often have a head smaller than the outer [[diameter]] of the screw. Headless set screws are also called grub screws.  J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the ''shank''; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1990|p=39}}.</ref> The distance between each thread is called the \"pitch\".\n\nThe majority of screws are tightened by [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] rotation, which is termed a ''right-hand thread''; a common [[mnemonic device]] for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is \"righty-tighty, lefty-loosey\". If the fingers of the right hand are curled around a right-hand thread, it will move in the direction of the thumb when turned in the same direction as the fingers are curled.  Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases, where loads would tend to loosen a right handed fastener, or when non-interchangeability with right-hand fasteners is required. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side [[Bicycle pedal#Attachment|pedal]] of a [[bicycle]] has a left-hand thread.\n\nMore generally, screw may mean any helical device, such as a clamp, a [[micrometer]], a ship's [[propeller]], or an [[Archimedes' screw]] water pump.\n\n==Differentiation between bolt and screw==\n[[File:Bolt (PSF).png|thumb|A carriage bolt with a square nut]]\n[[File:DIN6914 UNI5587.jpg|thumb|upright|A structural bolt with a hex nut and washer]]\n\nThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw ''screws into something'', a bolt ''bolts several things together''). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of \"screws\", nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'' describes the distinction as follows:\n\n{{quote|A bolt is an externally threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an externally threaded fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An externally threaded fastener which is prevented from being turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.) An externally threaded fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw. (Example: wood screws, tapping screws.)<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1492}}.</ref>}}\n\nThis distinction is consistent with [[ASME|ASME B18.2.1]] and some dictionary definitions for ''screw''<ref>{{cite web | title = Cambridge Dictionary of American English | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=screw*1+0&dict=A | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = allwords | url = http://www.allwords.com/query.php?SearchType=3&Keyword=screw&goquery=Find+it%21&Language=ENG | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}</ref> and ''bolt''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Merriam Webster Dictionary bolt | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolt | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Compact Oxford English Dictionary bolt | publisher = Oxford | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/bolt_1?view=uk | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary bolt | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=8680&dict=CALD | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}</ref>\n\nThe issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fastener Resource Center - Know your Bolts|url=http://www.fastenerexperts.com/bolt-guide/ |accessdate = 2011-03-13}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2013}} Some of these issues are discussed below:\n\n=== Wood screws ===\nEarly wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wag-aic.org/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf|title=Observations on the Development of Wood Screws in North America|last=White|first=Christopher|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the 1850s [[swaging]] tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread.

These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.\n\n=== Machine screws ===\n[[ASME]] standards specify a variety of \"Machine Screws\"<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=1568\u20131598}}.</ref> in diameters ranging up to {{convert|0.75|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  These fasteners are often used as [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]]s with nuts, but also often driven into [[tapped hole]]s (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.\n\n=== Hex cap screws ===\nASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is {{convert|0.25|\u2013|3|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]]. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  ''Machinery's Handbook'' refers parenthetically to these fasteners as \"Finished Hex Bolts\".<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1496}}.</ref> Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document ''Distinguishing Bolts from Screws'', the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Distinguishing Bolts from Screws page 7 |url= https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Apr/icp013_3.pdf |accessdate= 2018-07-23}}</ref> In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|title=National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST|website=NIST|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055941/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|archivedate=2011-07-21}}</ref> \"Fastener Quality Act\" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee.

The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25  in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm or {{convert|1/4|to|6|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).\n\nThe materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc [[galvanization]] (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray [[hot-dip galvanizing|hot-dip galvanized]]. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier ''lag'' came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of [[wikt:lag#Noun|lag]]s such as barrel staves and other similar parts.<ref name=\"MWCD\">{{Citation |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\nThese fasteners are \"screws\" according to the ''Machinery's Handbook'' criteria, and the obsolescent term \"lag bolt\" has been replaced by \"lag screw\" in the ''Handbook''.<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1497}}.</ref> However, to many tradesmen, they are \"bolts\", because they are large, with hex or square heads.\n\n=== United States government standards ===\nThe [[federal government of the United States]] made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different [[tariff]]s apply to each.<ref name=\"CBP.gov_bolts-vs-screws\">{{Citation |author=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) |authorlink=U.S. Customs and Border Protection  |date=July 2012 |title=What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know About: Distinguishing Bolts from Screws |series=An Informed Compliance Publication |edition=2011-02 |publisher=CBP.gov |location=Washington, D.C., USA |pages= |url=http://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/distinguishing-bolts-screws |doi= |id= |postscript=.}}</ref> The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms \"coarse\" and \"fine\" to refer to the tightness of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range, referring basically to \"high-quality\" or \"low-quality\", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to [[Screw thread#Coarse versus fine|the steepness of the helix's lead]]).\n\n=== Historical issue ===\nOld [[United States Standard|USS]] and [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded.<ref name=\"dyke\">{{Citation|title=Dyke's Automobile and Gasoline Engine Encyclopedia page 701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqI7AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA702&lpg=RA1-PA702&dq=sae+uss+screw+standard|accessdate = 2009-01-13|postscript=. | year=1919 | publisher=A.L. Dyke}}</ref> The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the ''grip'', was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that \"a bolt by definition takes a nut\". Using a coach \"bolt\" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.\n\n=== Controlled vocabulary versus natural language ===\nThe distinctions above are enforced in the [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[standards organization]]s. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the [[natural language]] use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the [[History of technology|changing of technology over centuries]]. The words ''bolt'' and ''screw'' have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved [[retronym]]ously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word ''screw'' has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw [[gimlet (tool)|gimlet]] (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.\n\nThe word ''bolt'' is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the [[crossbow]] bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called ''screw bolts'' in contradistinction to [[Clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|''clench bolts'']].\n\nIn common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, [[cylinder head]] bolts are called \"bolts\" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called \"screws\". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this [[natural language|natural]] word choice proclivity.\n\n====Other distinctions====\nBolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as [[ISO metric screw thread]] M, MJ, [[Unified Thread Standard]] UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}<!-- See the talk page. --> These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the ''Machinery's handbook'' distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.\n\nA possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.\nOn the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.\n\n==Types of screws and bolts==\nThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.\n\n===Fasteners with a tapered shank===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" | !!style=\"width: 200px\" | American name  !!style=\"width: 140px\" | British name !! class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n|  || chipboard screw<br />particle board screw ||  || Similar to a drywall screw except that it has a thinner shank and provides better resistance to pull-out in particle board, while offset against a lower shear strength.

The term ''socket head capscrew'' typically refers to a type of threaded fastener whose head diameter is [[Real versus nominal value|nominally]] 1.5 times that of the screw shank ([[major diameter|major]]) diameter, with a head height equal to the shank diameter (1960 series design). [[forging|Forged]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[alloy]] examples are high strength fasteners intended for the most demanding mechanical applications, with special alloy formulations available that are capable of maintaining strength at temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees F (587 degrees C).\n\nIn addition to the 1960 series design, other head designs include low head, button head and flat head, the latter designed to be seated into [[countersink|countersunk]] holes.  A [[hex key]] (sometimes referred to as an ''Allen wrench'' or ''Allen key'') or ''[[hex driver]]'' is required to tighten or loosen a socket screw. Socket head capscrews are commonly used in assemblies that do not provide sufficient clearance for a conventional wrench or [[socket wrench|socket]].\n|-\n| [[File:Carriage bolts.jpg|50px]] || carriage bolt || cup head bolt, coach bolt || A carriage bolt, also known as a coach bolt, has a domed or countersunk head, and the shank is topped by a short square section under the head. The square section grips into the part being fixed (typically wood), preventing the bolt from turning when the nut is tightened. Carriage bolts are used to provide a smooth finish on automobile metal bumper exteriors, the square section aligning with a square hole in the bumper to provide anti-rotation. A rib neck carriage bolt has several longitudinal ribs instead of the square section, to grip into a metal part being fixed.\n|-\n| [[File:Elevatorbolt.jpg|50px]] || elevator bolt ||  || An elevator bolt is a bolt similar to a carriage bolt, except the head (or foot, depending on the application) is thin and flat. There are many variations.<!-- an elevator bolt as described would only serve to push itself out-- you are thinking of t nuts, which use the triangle teeth to lock into the underside of the wood so you can insert a bolt from the top and not pull the t nut through the work piece, but still secure the bolt in the piece. --> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://myword.info/definition.php?id=el_head_1-a|title=elevator head definition|website=myword.info}}</ref>  Elevator bolts are designed to be used for leveling appliances or furniture.\n|-\n|  || eye bolt ||  || An eye bolt is a bolt with a looped head.<!-- Some have tapered threads -->\n|-\n| [[File:Bout.jpg|120px]] || hex cap screw<br />hex bolt ||  || A hex cap screw is a cap screw with a hexagonal head, designed to be driven by a wrench (spanner). An ASME B18.2.1 compliant cap screw has somewhat tighter tolerances than a hex bolt for the head height and the shank length. The nature of the tolerance difference allows an ASME B18.2.1 hex cap screw to always fit where a hex bolt is installed but a hex bolt could be slightly too large to be used where a hex cap screw is designed in.\n|-\n| [[File:100 TPI fine adjustment screw with close up, Oct 2012.jpg|80px]] || [[Fine adjustment screw]] ||  || The term fine adjustment screw typically refers to screws with threads from 40\u2013100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra fine adjustment screw has been used to refer to 100\u2013254 TPI (0.2mm to 0.1mm pitch).  These screws are most frequently used in applications where the screw is used to control fine motion of an object.\n|-\n| [[File:44215700s 04.jpg|90px]] || machine screw ||  || A machine screw is generally a smaller fastener (less than {{convert|1/4|in|mm|2}} in diameter) threaded the entire length of its shank that usually has a recessed drive type (slotted, Phillips, etc.).  Machine screws are also made with socket heads (see above), in which case they may be referred to as socket head machine screws.\n|-\n| [[File:Plowbolt.jpg|120px]] [[File:Shiny Ploughshares.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Plow bolts in use]] || [[plow bolt]] || plough bolt || A plow bolt is bolt similar to a carriage bolt, except the head is flat or concave, and the underside of the head is a cone designed to fit in a countersunk recess. Plow bolts provide a smooth surface for attaching a [[Plough#Mouldboard plough|plow moldboard]] to its beam, where a raised head would suffer from soil abrasion. There are  many variations, with some not using a square base, but rather a key, a locking slot, or other means. The recess in the mating part must be designed to accept the particular plow bolt.  ASME B18.9 standard recommends a No. 3 head (round countersunk head square neck) plow bolts and No. 7 head (round countersunk reverse key head) plow bolts for new designs.  The necessary dimensions for the head styles can be found in the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Colvin|Stanley|1914|p=569}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Plow bolts | url = http://www.masterbolt.com/plow_bolts.html | accessdate = 2008-12-25 | postscript =.}}</ref><ref>[http://myword.info/definition.php?id=pl_head_1-a The Meaning of \"plow head, plow bolt\"] at MyWord.info</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:Vis-auto-foreuse.jpeg|120px]] || self-drilling screw<br />Tek screw ||  || Similar to a sheet metal screw, but it has a drill-shaped point to cut through the substrate to eliminate the need for drilling a pilot hole.

The advantage of this screw type over a self-drilling screw is that, if the screw is reinstalled, new threads are not cut as the screw is driven.\n|-\n| || set bolt || tap bolt || A bolt that is threaded all the way to the head. An ASME B18.2.1 compliant set/tap bolt has the same tolerances as an ASME B18.2.1 compliant hex cap screw.\n|-\n| [[File:Setscrews (PSF).png|60px]] || [[set screw]] || grub screw || A set screw is generally a headless screw but can be any screw used to fix a rotating part to a shaft, such as a [[line shaft]] or [[jackshaft|countershaft]]. The set screw is driven through a threaded hole in the rotating part until it is tight against the shaft.  The most often used type is the socket set screw, which is tightened or loosened with a hex key.\n|-\n| || shoulder bolt<br />shoulder screw || stripper bolt || A shoulder screw differs from machine screws in that the shank is held to a precise diameter, known as the ''shoulder'', and the threaded portion is smaller in diameter than the shoulder. Shoulder screw specifications call out the shoulder diameter, shoulder length, and threaded diameter; the threaded length is fixed, based on the threaded diameter, and usually quite short. Shoulder screws can be manufactured in many materials such as [[alloy]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[steel]] for maximum strength and wear resistance and stainless steel for its corrosion-resistance and non-magnetic properties. Common applications for shoulder screws include rotating [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism joints]], [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage pivots]], and guides for the [[stripper plate]] of a [[die (manufacturing)|metal forming die]] set.  In the latter application, the term stripper bolt is often substituted. Stainless steel shoulder screws are used with linear motion devices such as bearings, as guides and as pivots in electronic and other critical mechanical applications. \n|-\n|  || stove bolt || gutter bolt || A stove bolt is a type of machine screw that has a round or flat head and is threaded to the head.

The head is usually domed and is not designed to be driven. The end of the shank has a spline on it which is engaged by a special power wrench which prevents the bolt from turning while the nut is tightened. When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.\n|-\n| || thread rolling screws ||  || These have a lobed (usually triangular) cross-section. They form threads in a pre-existing hole in the mating workpiece by pushing the material outward during installation. In some cases the properly prepared hole in sheetmetal uses an extruded hole. The extrusion forms a lead-in and extra thread length for improved retention. Thread rolling screws are often used where loose chips formed by a thread cutting operation cannot be tolerated. \n|}\n\n===Fasteners with built in washers===\nA fastener with a built in [[Washer (hardware)|washer]] is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-as'''SEM'''bled.<ref>{{cite web|title=All About Screws|url=http://www.elexp.com/tips/AllAboutScrews.pdf|publisher=Curious Inventor|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/glossary.htm#s|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>   It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.\n\n===Other threaded fasteners===\n\n==== Superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner ====\nA superbolt, or [[multi-jackbolt tensioner]] is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.\n\n====Bone screws====\n{{Main|internal fixation}}\nThe field of screws and other hardware for [[internal fixation]] within the body is huge and diverse. Like [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as [[machining]], [[CAD/CAM]], and [[3D printing]]) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary [[list of screw drives|screw drive]] types (some not seen outside of these applications).\n\n===List of abbreviations for types of screws===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThese abbreviations have [[jargon]] currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, if you know that \"FH\" means \"flat head\", then you may be able to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing \"FH\".\n\nThese abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own.

Structural bolts replaced rivets due to the decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the \"faying\" surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction is proportional to the normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second (and more common type) of connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection, the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a \"snug-fit\". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in lightweight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.\n\n==Mechanical classifications==<!-- [[Property class]] & [[Grade (fasteners)]] redirect here -->\nThe numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] strength rating (called ''property class'') stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the [[ultimate tensile strength]] in [[megapascal|MPa]] divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.\n\nUltimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% [[yield strength#Definition|offset strain]]. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brenner|first1=Harry S.|editor1-last=Parmley|editor1-first=Robert O.|title=Standard Handbook of Fastening and Joining|date=1977|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-048511-9|page=Chapter 1 page 10|edition=5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardhandbook00parm}}</ref> If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.\n\nMild steel bolts have property class 4.6, which is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.\n\nThe same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt.<ref>\"[http://blog.chiltondiy.com/2013/12/how-to-recognize-metric-and-sae-bolts-2/ How to Recognize Metric and SAE Bolts]\", Chilton DIY, Retrieved April 26, 2016.</ref> However, low-cost [[counterfeit]] fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings.

This eliminates the need for a [[flat washer]].\n\nSome varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle [[steering column]]s, to secure the [[ignition switch]].\n\n== {{visible anchor|Types of screw drive}}s ==\n{{Screw drives|screw}}\n{{Main|List of screw drives}}\n\nModern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.\n\n==Tools==\n[[File:Screw-into-wood.ogg|left|180px|thumb|An electric driver screws a self-tapping phillips head screw into wood]]\n\nThe hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a ''[[screwdriver]]''. A power tool that does the same job is a ''power screwdriver''; [[power drill]]s may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and ''torque-limiting screwdrivers'' are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a ''spanner'' (UK usage) or ''wrench'' (US usage), while a ''nut setter'' is used with a power screw driver.\n\n==Thread standards==\n{{Contradicts other|date=February 2010|1=Screw thread}}\n{{Main|Screw thread}}\n\nThere are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the [[ISO metric screw thread]] preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the [[British Standard Whitworth]], [[British Association screw threads|BA system (British Association)]], and the [[Unified Thread Standard]].\n\n===ISO metric screw thread===\n{{Main|ISO metric screw thread}}\n\nThe basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in [[international standard]] [[ISO 68-1]] and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in [[ISO 262]]. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the ''coarse pitch''. For some diameters, one or two additional ''fine pitch'' variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter '''M''' followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimetres (e.g. ''M8''). If the thread does not use the normal ''coarse pitch'' (e.g. 1.25&nbsp;mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a [[multiplication sign]] (e.g. \"M8\u00d71\" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8&nbsp;mm and advances by 1&nbsp;mm per 360\u00b0 rotation).\n\nThe nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1&nbsp;mm, is made by threading a 6&nbsp;mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5&nbsp;mm diameter (6&nbsp;mm - 1&nbsp;mm).\n\nMetric [[hexagon]] bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in [[International Organization for Standardization|International Standards]] ISO 4014, ISO 4017, and ISO 4032. The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximum width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n! ISO metric thread\n|M1.6||M2||M2.5||M3||M4||M5||M6||M8||M10||M12||M16||M20||M24||M30||M36||M42||M48||M56||M64\n|-\n! Wrench size (mm)\n|3.2||4||5||5.5||7||8||10||13||16||18||24||30||36||46||55||65||75||85||95\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n! ISO metric thread\n|M3.5||M14||M18||M22||M27||M33||M39||M45||M52||M60\n|-\n! Wrench size (mm)\n|6||21||27||34||41||50||60||70||80||90\n|}\n\nBear in mind that these are just examples and the width across flats is different for structural bolts, flanged bolts, and also varies by standards organization.\n\n===Whitworth===\n{{Main|British Standard Whitworth}}\n\nThe first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the [[England|English]] [[engineer]] Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became ''British Standard Whitworth'', abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the ''British Standard Fine'' (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The [[thread angle]] was 55\u00b0, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.\n\nThe most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK [[scaffolding]]. Additionally, the standard photographic [[tripod (photography)|tripod]] thread, which for small cameras is 1/4\" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8\" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with \"thread adapters\" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4\" [[Unified National Coarse|UNC]] bolts fit 1/4\" BSW camera tripod bushes, [[yield strength]] is reduced by the different thread angles of 60\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 respectively.\n\n===British Association screw thread===\n{{Main|British Association screw threads}}\n\nBritish Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as \"2BA\", \"4BA\" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order\u2014it may be suspected\u2014to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 \"Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A.\"\n\nWhile not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6&nbsp;mm diameter and 1&nbsp;mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch <math>\\scriptstyle p=0.9^4</math>&nbsp;mm (0.65mm) and diameter <math>\\scriptstyle 6p^{1.2}</math>&nbsp;mm (3.62mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.\n\nBA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.\n\nBA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.<ref>http://www.threadcheck.com/technical-documents/thread-systems.pdf</ref>\n\n===Unified Thread Standard===\n{{Main|Unified Thread Standard}}\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the [[United States]], but is also extensively used in [[Canada]] and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: '''X-Y''', where '''X''' is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and '''Y''' is the [[threads per inch]] (TPI). For sizes {{frac|1|4}} inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an [[integer]] is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 &times; number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 &times; 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112&nbsp;inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than \"0\" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought \u2013 seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of \"ought\" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 \u2013 (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp97-99\" />\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Bolt Forming.svg|thumb|300px]]\n[[File:Screw (bolt) 13-n.PNG|thumb]]\n{{see also|Threading (manufacturing)}}\n\nThere are three steps in manufacturing a screw: ''heading'', ''thread rolling'', and ''coating''. Screws are normally made from [[wire]], which is supplied in large coils, or round [[bar stock]] for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a ''blank''. It is then [[heading (metalworking)|cold headed]], which is a [[cold working]] process. Heading produces the ''head'' of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a ''slotting machine''. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.\n<!--\nThe process works as follows: the bar stock is fed into a machine, called a \"former\". The bar stock is stopped, and then gripped by a gripping [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. The gripping die is shaped in such a way that it forms a carriage along the neck of the stock when its full gripping force is applied. An indented [[Punch (engineering)|punch]], the shape of a rounded head, will then proceed to move forward, colliding with the stock and causing the metal to flow at right angles to the ram force provided by the punch, increasing the diameter of the workpiece, and reducing its overall length, thus forming a \"rounded\" head. The work billet is then [[Shearing (manufacturing)|shear]]ed to the desired length. ---A ref needs to be found for all this, because the first paragraph states that blanks are made then formed and the second states that the shank and heading occur first then its cut to length. Wizard191-->\n\nThe blanks are then polished{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}<!-- It seems more logical that the author meant \"clean\" and/or \"degrease\" because polishing is expensive and seemingly unnecessary. --> again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via [[thread rolling]]; however, some are [[thread cutting|cut]]. The workpiece is then [[tumble finishing|tumble finished]] with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} For most screws, a coating, such as [[electroplating]] with zinc ([[galvanizing]]) or applying [[black oxide]], is applied to prevent corrosion.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Screw making machine, 1871.png|thumb|right|A [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] of 1871, equipped with [[leadscrew]] and change gears for single-point screw-cutting.]]\n[[File:Brownie-4slide.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Brown & Sharpe]] single-[[Spindle (tool)|spindle]] screw machine.]]\n\nWhile a recent hypothesis attributes the [[Archimedes' screw]] to [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the [[Hellenistic period]] and the standard view holds the device to be a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath [[Archimedes]].<ref>[[Stephanie Dalley]] and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003). \"Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World\", ''Technology and Culture'' '''44''' (1).</ref>{{dubious|date=December 2010}}  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.\n\nEarlier, the screw had been described by the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archytas|Archytas of Tarentum]] (428\u2013350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world in [[screw press]]es for pressing [[olive oil]] from olives and pressing juice from grapes in [[winemaking]]. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.<ref name=\"MFA\">{{Citation | title = Am_Wood_Screws | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/wag/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf | accessdate = 2010-04-30 | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\nRybczynski has shown<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp34,66,90\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=34, 66, 90}}.</ref> that handheld [[screwdriver]]s (formerly called \"turnscrews\" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, ''tournevis''<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp32-36,44\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=32\u201336, 44}}.</ref>) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.{{peacock term|date=June 2016}}\n\nThere were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as [[dowel]]s and pins, wedging, [[mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]], [[dovetail joint|dovetails]], [[nail (fastener)|nailing]] (with or without clenching the nail ends), [[forge welding]], and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of [[knot]]s. Prior to the mid-19th century, [[Split pin|cotter pins]] or [[clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|pin bolts]], and \"clinch bolts\" (now called [[Rivet#Types|rivet]]s), were used in shipbuilding. [[Adhesive|Glues]] also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.\n\nThe metal screw did not become a common fastener until [[machine tool]]s for their [[mass production]] were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp75-99\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=75\u201399}}.</ref> along two separate paths that soon [[technological convergence|converged]]:<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p99\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=99}}.</ref> the mass production of ''wood'' screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, [[toolroom]]-style production of ''machine'' screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).\n\nThe first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of [[Staffordshire]], UK,<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p75\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=75}}.</ref> who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a [[Automatic lathe#Screw machine|screw machine]] of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch,<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p75\"/> and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p75\"/> Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p76\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=76}}.</ref>\u2014the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, English instrument maker [[Jesse Ramsden]] (1735\u20131800) was working on the [[tool and die maker|toolmaking]] and [[:Category:Scientific instrument makers|instrument-making]] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory [[screw-cutting lathe]].<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp97-99\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=97\u201399}}.</ref> The British engineer [[Henry Maudslay]] (1771\u20131831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring [[commodification]]. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of [[James Nasmyth]] popularized the notion that Maudslay had ''invented'' the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.\n\nThese developments of the 1760\u20131800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. [[Screw thread#History of standardization|Standardization of threadforms]] began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push [[unit price]]s lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp76-78\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=76\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1821, the first screw factory in the United States was built by Hardman Philips on Moshannon Creek, near [[Philipsburg,_Centre_County,_Pennsylvania|Philipsburg]] for the manufacture of blunt metal screws. An expert in screw manufacture, Thomas Lever was brought over from England to run the factory. The mill was run by steam and water power, and the fuel used was hardwood charcoal. The screws were made from wire prepared by \u201crolling and wire drawing apparatus\u201d from iron manufactured at a nearby forge. The screw mill was not a commercial success. It eventually failed due to competition from the lower cost, gimlet-pointed screw and ceased operations in 1836. <ref name=\"Mitchell2009\">{{cite book|author=J.

This [[demand curve|cost reduction spurred ever greater use]] of screws.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, [[List of screw drives|drive types]]) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to [[Machining|machine]] and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s,<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp79-81\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=79\u201381}}.</ref> but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian [[P. L. Robertson]] was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal [[cold forming]] as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp79-81\"/> Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive ([[hex key|hex socket]]) shortly followed in 1911.<ref name=\"US_patent_161390\">{{US patent|161,390}}.</ref><ref name=\"Hallowell1951pp51-59\">{{Harvnb|Hallowell|1951|pp=51\u201359}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1930s, the popular Phillips-head screw was invented by American [[Henry F.

Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that may help pull fastened materials together and  prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.\n\n==Explanation==\nA screw is a combination of [[simple machines]]\u2014it is in essence an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge in the form of the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a ''female thread'' (internal thread), often in the form of a nut, or object that has the internal thread formed into it.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.\n\n[[File:Wood screw with legend.svg|thumb|A wood screw: a) head; b) non-threaded shank; c) threaded shank; d) tip.]]\n\nA screw will usually have a ''head'' on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include [[screwdriver]]s and [[wrench]]es. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a ''[[bearing surface]]''. There are exceptions. Carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven.  [[Set screw]]s often have a head smaller than the outer [[diameter]] of the screw. Headless set screws are also called grub screws.  J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the ''shank''; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1990|p=39}}.</ref> The distance between each thread is called the \"pitch\".\n\nThe majority of screws are tightened by [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] rotation, which is termed a ''right-hand thread''; a common [[mnemonic device]] for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is \"righty-tighty, lefty-loosey\". If the fingers of the right hand are curled around a right-hand thread, it will move in the direction of the thumb when turned in the same direction as the fingers are curled.  Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases, where loads would tend to loosen a right handed fastener, or when non-interchangeability with right-hand fasteners is required. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side [[Bicycle pedal#Attachment|pedal]] of a [[bicycle]] has a left-hand thread.\n\nMore generally, screw may mean any helical device, such as a clamp, a [[micrometer]], a ship's [[propeller]], or an [[Archimedes' screw]] water pump.\n\n==Differentiation between bolt and screw==\n[[File:Bolt (PSF).png|thumb|A carriage bolt with a square nut]]\n[[File:DIN6914 UNI5587.jpg|thumb|upright|A structural bolt with a hex nut and washer]]\n\nThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw ''screws into something'', a bolt ''bolts several things together''). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of \"screws\", nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'' describes the distinction as follows:\n\n{{quote|A bolt is an externally threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an externally threaded fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An externally threaded fastener which is prevented from being turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.)

Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wag-aic.org/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf|title=Observations on the Development of Wood Screws in North America|last=White|first=Christopher|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the 1850s [[swaging]] tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread.

These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.\n\n=== Machine screws ===\n[[ASME]] standards specify a variety of \"Machine Screws\"<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=1568\u20131598}}.</ref> in diameters ranging up to {{convert|0.75|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  These fasteners are often used as [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]]s with nuts, but also often driven into [[tapped hole]]s (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.\n\n=== Hex cap screws ===\nASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is {{convert|0.25|\u2013|3|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]]. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  ''Machinery's Handbook'' refers parenthetically to these fasteners as \"Finished Hex Bolts\".<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1496}}.</ref> Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document ''Distinguishing Bolts from Screws'', the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Distinguishing Bolts from Screws page 7 |url= https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Apr/icp013_3.pdf |accessdate= 2018-07-23}}</ref> In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|title=National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST|website=NIST|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055941/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|archivedate=2011-07-21}}</ref> \"Fastener Quality Act\" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee.

The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25  in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm or {{convert|1/4|to|6|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).\n\nThe materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc [[galvanization]] (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray [[hot-dip galvanizing|hot-dip galvanized]]. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier ''lag'' came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of [[wikt:lag#Noun|lag]]s such as barrel staves and other similar parts.<ref name=\"MWCD\">{{Citation |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\nThese fasteners are \"screws\" according to the ''Machinery's Handbook'' criteria, and the obsolescent term \"lag bolt\" has been replaced by \"lag screw\" in the ''Handbook''.<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1497}}.</ref> However, to many tradesmen, they are \"bolts\", because they are large, with hex or square heads.\n\n=== United States government standards ===\nThe [[federal government of the United States]] made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different [[tariff]]s apply to each.<ref name=\"CBP.gov_bolts-vs-screws\">{{Citation |author=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) |authorlink=U.S. Customs and Border Protection  |date=July 2012 |title=What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know About: Distinguishing Bolts from Screws |series=An Informed Compliance Publication |edition=2011-02 |publisher=CBP.gov |location=Washington, D.C., USA |pages= |url=http://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/distinguishing-bolts-screws |doi= |id= |postscript=.}}</ref> The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms \"coarse\" and \"fine\" to refer to the tightness of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range, referring basically to \"high-quality\" or \"low-quality\", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to [[Screw thread#Coarse versus fine|the steepness of the helix's lead]]).\n\n=== Historical issue ===\nOld [[United States Standard|USS]] and [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded.<ref name=\"dyke\">{{Citation|title=Dyke's Automobile and Gasoline Engine Encyclopedia page 701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqI7AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA702&lpg=RA1-PA702&dq=sae+uss+screw+standard|accessdate = 2009-01-13|postscript=. | year=1919 | publisher=A.L. Dyke}}</ref> The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the ''grip'', was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that \"a bolt by definition takes a nut\". Using a coach \"bolt\" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.\n\n=== Controlled vocabulary versus natural language ===\nThe distinctions above are enforced in the [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[standards organization]]s. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the [[natural language]] use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the [[History of technology|changing of technology over centuries]]. The words ''bolt'' and ''screw'' have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved [[retronym]]ously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word ''screw'' has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw [[gimlet (tool)|gimlet]] (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.\n\nThe word ''bolt'' is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the [[crossbow]] bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called ''screw bolts'' in contradistinction to [[Clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|''clench bolts'']].\n\nIn common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, [[cylinder head]] bolts are called \"bolts\" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called \"screws\". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this [[natural language|natural]] word choice proclivity.\n\n====Other distinctions====\nBolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as [[ISO metric screw thread]] M, MJ, [[Unified Thread Standard]] UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}<!-- See the talk page. --> These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the ''Machinery's handbook'' distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.\n\nA possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.\nOn the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.\n\n==Types of screws and bolts==\nThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.\n\n===Fasteners with a tapered shank===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" | !!style=\"width: 200px\" | American name  !!style=\"width: 140px\" | British name !! class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n|  || chipboard screw<br />particle board screw ||  || Similar to a drywall screw except that it has a thinner shank and provides better resistance to pull-out in particle board, while offset against a lower shear strength.

These screws are most frequently used in applications where the screw is used to control fine motion of an object.\n|-\n| [[File:44215700s 04.jpg|90px]] || machine screw ||  || A machine screw is generally a smaller fastener (less than {{convert|1/4|in|mm|2}} in diameter) threaded the entire length of its shank that usually has a recessed drive type (slotted, Phillips, etc.).  Machine screws are also made with socket heads (see above), in which case they may be referred to as socket head machine screws.\n|-\n| [[File:Plowbolt.jpg|120px]] [[File:Shiny Ploughshares.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Plow bolts in use]] || [[plow bolt]] || plough bolt || A plow bolt is bolt similar to a carriage bolt, except the head is flat or concave, and the underside of the head is a cone designed to fit in a countersunk recess. Plow bolts provide a smooth surface for attaching a [[Plough#Mouldboard plough|plow moldboard]] to its beam, where a raised head would suffer from soil abrasion. There are  many variations, with some not using a square base, but rather a key, a locking slot, or other means. The recess in the mating part must be designed to accept the particular plow bolt.  ASME B18.9 standard recommends a No. 3 head (round countersunk head square neck) plow bolts and No. 7 head (round countersunk reverse key head) plow bolts for new designs.  The necessary dimensions for the head styles can be found in the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Colvin|Stanley|1914|p=569}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Plow bolts | url = http://www.masterbolt.com/plow_bolts.html | accessdate = 2008-12-25 | postscript =.}}</ref><ref>[http://myword.info/definition.php?id=pl_head_1-a The Meaning of \"plow head, plow bolt\"] at MyWord.info</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:Vis-auto-foreuse.jpeg|120px]] || self-drilling screw<br />Tek screw ||  || Similar to a sheet metal screw, but it has a drill-shaped point to cut through the substrate to eliminate the need for drilling a pilot hole. Designed for use in soft steel or other metals. The points are numbered from 1 through 5, the larger the number, the thicker metal it can go through without a pilot hole. A 5-point can drill a {{convert|0.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} of steel, for example.\n|-\n| [[File:Vis-auto-taraudeuse.jpeg|120px]] || self-tapping machine screw ||  || A self-tapping machine screw is similar to a machine screw except the lower part of the shank is designed to cut threads as the screw is driven into an untapped hole. The advantage of this screw type over a self-drilling screw is that, if the screw is reinstalled, new threads are not cut as the screw is driven.\n|-\n| || set bolt || tap bolt || A bolt that is threaded all the way to the head. An ASME B18.2.1 compliant set/tap bolt has the same tolerances as an ASME B18.2.1 compliant hex cap screw.\n|-\n| [[File:Setscrews (PSF).png|60px]] || [[set screw]] || grub screw || A set screw is generally a headless screw but can be any screw used to fix a rotating part to a shaft, such as a [[line shaft]] or [[jackshaft|countershaft]]. The set screw is driven through a threaded hole in the rotating part until it is tight against the shaft.  The most often used type is the socket set screw, which is tightened or loosened with a hex key.\n|-\n| || shoulder bolt<br />shoulder screw || stripper bolt || A shoulder screw differs from machine screws in that the shank is held to a precise diameter, known as the ''shoulder'', and the threaded portion is smaller in diameter than the shoulder. Shoulder screw specifications call out the shoulder diameter, shoulder length, and threaded diameter; the threaded length is fixed, based on the threaded diameter, and usually quite short. Shoulder screws can be manufactured in many materials such as [[alloy]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[steel]] for maximum strength and wear resistance and stainless steel for its corrosion-resistance and non-magnetic properties. Common applications for shoulder screws include rotating [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism joints]], [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage pivots]], and guides for the [[stripper plate]] of a [[die (manufacturing)|metal forming die]] set.  In the latter application, the term stripper bolt is often substituted. Stainless steel shoulder screws are used with linear motion devices such as bearings, as guides and as pivots in electronic and other critical mechanical applications. \n|-\n|  || stove bolt || gutter bolt || A stove bolt is a type of machine screw that has a round or flat head and is threaded to the head. They are usually made of low grade steel, have a slot or Phillips drive, and are used to join sheet metal parts using a hex or square nut.<ref>Huth, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref>\n|-\n| || tension control bolt || || A tension control bolt (TC bolt) is a heavy duty bolt used in steel frame construction. The head is usually domed and is not designed to be driven. The end of the shank has a spline on it which is engaged by a special power wrench which prevents the bolt from turning while the nut is tightened. When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.\n|-\n| || thread rolling screws ||  || These have a lobed (usually triangular) cross-section. They form threads in a pre-existing hole in the mating workpiece by pushing the material outward during installation. In some cases the properly prepared hole in sheetmetal uses an extruded hole. The extrusion forms a lead-in and extra thread length for improved retention. Thread rolling screws are often used where loose chips formed by a thread cutting operation cannot be tolerated. \n|}\n\n===Fasteners with built in washers===\nA fastener with a built in [[Washer (hardware)|washer]] is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-as'''SEM'''bled.<ref>{{cite web|title=All About Screws|url=http://www.elexp.com/tips/AllAboutScrews.pdf|publisher=Curious Inventor|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/glossary.htm#s|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>   It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.\n\n===Other threaded fasteners===\n\n==== Superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner ====\nA superbolt, or [[multi-jackbolt tensioner]] is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.\n\n====Bone screws====\n{{Main|internal fixation}}\nThe field of screws and other hardware for [[internal fixation]] within the body is huge and diverse. Like [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as [[machining]], [[CAD/CAM]], and [[3D printing]]) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary [[list of screw drives|screw drive]] types (some not seen outside of these applications).\n\n===List of abbreviations for types of screws===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThese abbreviations have [[jargon]] currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, if you know that \"FH\" means \"flat head\", then you may be able to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing \"FH\".\n\nThese abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own.

Structural bolts replaced rivets due to the decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the \"faying\" surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction is proportional to the normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second (and more common type) of connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection, the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a \"snug-fit\". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in lightweight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.\n\n==Mechanical classifications==<!-- [[Property class]] & [[Grade (fasteners)]] redirect here -->\nThe numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] strength rating (called ''property class'') stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the [[ultimate tensile strength]] in [[megapascal|MPa]] divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.\n\nUltimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% [[yield strength#Definition|offset strain]]. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brenner|first1=Harry S.|editor1-last=Parmley|editor1-first=Robert O.|title=Standard Handbook of Fastening and Joining|date=1977|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-048511-9|page=Chapter 1 page 10|edition=5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardhandbook00parm}}</ref> If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.\n\nMild steel bolts have property class 4.6, which is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.\n\nThe same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt.<ref>\"[http://blog.chiltondiy.com/2013/12/how-to-recognize-metric-and-sae-bolts-2/ How to Recognize Metric and SAE Bolts]\", Chilton DIY, Retrieved April 26, 2016.</ref> However, low-cost [[counterfeit]] fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings.

This eliminates the need for a [[flat washer]].\n\nSome varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle [[steering column]]s, to secure the [[ignition switch]].\n\n== {{visible anchor|Types of screw drive}}s ==\n{{Screw drives|screw}}\n{{Main|List of screw drives}}\n\nModern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.\n\n==Tools==\n[[File:Screw-into-wood.ogg|left|180px|thumb|An electric driver screws a self-tapping phillips head screw into wood]]\n\nThe hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a ''[[screwdriver]]''. A power tool that does the same job is a ''power screwdriver''; [[power drill]]s may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and ''torque-limiting screwdrivers'' are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a ''spanner'' (UK usage) or ''wrench'' (US usage), while a ''nut setter'' is used with a power screw driver.\n\n==Thread standards==\n{{Contradicts other|date=February 2010|1=Screw thread}}\n{{Main|Screw thread}}\n\nThere are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the [[ISO metric screw thread]] preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the [[British Standard Whitworth]], [[British Association screw threads|BA system (British Association)]], and the [[Unified Thread Standard]].\n\n===ISO metric screw thread===\n{{Main|ISO metric screw thread}}\n\nThe basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in [[international standard]] [[ISO 68-1]] and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in [[ISO 262]]. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the ''coarse pitch''. For some diameters, one or two additional ''fine pitch'' variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter '''M''' followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimetres (e.g. ''M8''). If the thread does not use the normal ''coarse pitch'' (e.g. 1.25&nbsp;mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a [[multiplication sign]] (e.g. \"M8\u00d71\" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8&nbsp;mm and advances by 1&nbsp;mm per 360\u00b0 rotation).\n\nThe nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1&nbsp;mm, is made by threading a 6&nbsp;mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5&nbsp;mm diameter (6&nbsp;mm - 1&nbsp;mm).\n\nMetric [[hexagon]] bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in [[International Organization for Standardization|International Standards]] ISO 4014, ISO 4017, and ISO 4032. The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximum width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n! ISO metric thread\n|M1.6||M2||M2.5||M3||M4||M5||M6||M8||M10||M12||M16||M20||M24||M30||M36||M42||M48||M56||M64\n|-\n! Wrench size (mm)\n|3.2||4||5||5.5||7||8||10||13||16||18||24||30||36||46||55||65||75||85||95\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n! ISO metric thread\n|M3.5||M14||M18||M22||M27||M33||M39||M45||M52||M60\n|-\n! Wrench size (mm)\n|6||21||27||34||41||50||60||70||80||90\n|}\n\nBear in mind that these are just examples and the width across flats is different for structural bolts, flanged bolts, and also varies by standards organization.\n\n===Whitworth===\n{{Main|British Standard Whitworth}}\n\nThe first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the [[England|English]] [[engineer]] Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became ''British Standard Whitworth'', abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the ''British Standard Fine'' (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The [[thread angle]] was 55\u00b0, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.\n\nThe most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK [[scaffolding]]. Additionally, the standard photographic [[tripod (photography)|tripod]] thread, which for small cameras is 1/4\" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8\" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with \"thread adapters\" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4\" [[Unified National Coarse|UNC]] bolts fit 1/4\" BSW camera tripod bushes, [[yield strength]] is reduced by the different thread angles of 60\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 respectively.\n\n===British Association screw thread===\n{{Main|British Association screw threads}}\n\nBritish Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as \"2BA\", \"4BA\" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order\u2014it may be suspected\u2014to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 \"Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A.\"\n\nWhile not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6&nbsp;mm diameter and 1&nbsp;mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch <math>\\scriptstyle p=0.9^4</math>&nbsp;mm (0.65mm) and diameter <math>\\scriptstyle 6p^{1.2}</math>&nbsp;mm (3.62mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.\n\nBA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.\n\nBA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.<ref>http://www.threadcheck.com/technical-documents/thread-systems.pdf</ref>\n\n===Unified Thread Standard===\n{{Main|Unified Thread Standard}}\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the [[United States]], but is also extensively used in [[Canada]] and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: '''X-Y''', where '''X''' is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and '''Y''' is the [[threads per inch]] (TPI). For sizes {{frac|1|4}} inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an [[integer]] is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 &times; number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 &times; 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112&nbsp;inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than \"0\" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought \u2013 seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of \"ought\" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 \u2013 (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp97-99\" />\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Bolt Forming.svg|thumb|300px]]\n[[File:Screw (bolt) 13-n.PNG|thumb]]\n{{see also|Threading (manufacturing)}}\n\nThere are three steps in manufacturing a screw: ''heading'', ''thread rolling'', and ''coating''. Screws are normally made from [[wire]], which is supplied in large coils, or round [[bar stock]] for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a ''blank''. It is then [[heading (metalworking)|cold headed]], which is a [[cold working]] process. Heading produces the ''head'' of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a ''slotting machine''. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.\n<!--\nThe process works as follows: the bar stock is fed into a machine, called a \"former\". The bar stock is stopped, and then gripped by a gripping [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. The gripping die is shaped in such a way that it forms a carriage along the neck of the stock when its full gripping force is applied. An indented [[Punch (engineering)|punch]], the shape of a rounded head, will then proceed to move forward, colliding with the stock and causing the metal to flow at right angles to the ram force provided by the punch, increasing the diameter of the workpiece, and reducing its overall length, thus forming a \"rounded\" head. The work billet is then [[Shearing (manufacturing)|shear]]ed to the desired length. ---A ref needs to be found for all this, because the first paragraph states that blanks are made then formed and the second states that the shank and heading occur first then its cut to length.

By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world in [[screw press]]es for pressing [[olive oil]] from olives and pressing juice from grapes in [[winemaking]]. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.<ref name=\"MFA\">{{Citation | title = Am_Wood_Screws | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/wag/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf | accessdate = 2010-04-30 | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\nRybczynski has shown<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp34,66,90\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=34, 66, 90}}.</ref> that handheld [[screwdriver]]s (formerly called \"turnscrews\" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, ''tournevis''<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp32-36,44\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=32\u201336, 44}}.</ref>) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.{{peacock term|date=June 2016}}\n\nThere were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as [[dowel]]s and pins, wedging, [[mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]], [[dovetail joint|dovetails]], [[nail (fastener)|nailing]] (with or without clenching the nail ends), [[forge welding]], and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of [[knot]]s. Prior to the mid-19th century, [[Split pin|cotter pins]] or [[clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|pin bolts]], and \"clinch bolts\" (now called [[Rivet#Types|rivet]]s), were used in shipbuilding. [[Adhesive|Glues]] also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.\n\nThe metal screw did not become a common fastener until [[machine tool]]s for their [[mass production]] were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp75-99\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=75\u201399}}.</ref> along two separate paths that soon [[technological convergence|converged]]:<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p99\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=99}}.</ref> the mass production of ''wood'' screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, [[toolroom]]-style production of ''machine'' screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).\n\nThe first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of [[Staffordshire]], UK,<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p75\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=75}}.</ref> who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a [[Automatic lathe#Screw machine|screw machine]] of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch,<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p75\"/> and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p75\"/> Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000p76\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=76}}.</ref>\u2014the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, English instrument maker [[Jesse Ramsden]] (1735\u20131800) was working on the [[tool and die maker|toolmaking]] and [[:Category:Scientific instrument makers|instrument-making]] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory [[screw-cutting lathe]].<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp97-99\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=97\u201399}}.</ref> The British engineer [[Henry Maudslay]] (1771\u20131831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring [[commodification]]. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of [[James Nasmyth]] popularized the notion that Maudslay had ''invented'' the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.\n\nThese developments of the 1760\u20131800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. [[Screw thread#History of standardization|Standardization of threadforms]] began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push [[unit price]]s lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp76-78\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=76\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1821, the first screw factory in the United States was built by Hardman Philips on Moshannon Creek, near [[Philipsburg,_Centre_County,_Pennsylvania|Philipsburg]] for the manufacture of blunt metal screws. An expert in screw manufacture, Thomas Lever was brought over from England to run the factory. The mill was run by steam and water power, and the fuel used was hardwood charcoal. The screws were made from wire prepared by \u201crolling and wire drawing apparatus\u201d from iron manufactured at a nearby forge. The screw mill was not a commercial success. It eventually failed due to competition from the lower cost, gimlet-pointed screw and ceased operations in 1836. <ref name=\"Mitchell2009\">{{cite book|author=J.

This [[demand curve|cost reduction spurred ever greater use]] of screws.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, [[List of screw drives|drive types]]) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to [[Machining|machine]] and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s,<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp79-81\">{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=79\u201381}}.</ref> but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian [[P. L. Robertson]] was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal [[cold forming]] as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways.<ref name=\"Rybczynski2000pp79-81\"/> Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive ([[hex key|hex socket]]) shortly followed in 1911.<ref name=\"US_patent_161390\">{{US patent|161,390}}.</ref><ref name=\"Hallowell1951pp51-59\">{{Harvnb|Hallowell|1951|pp=51\u201359}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1930s, the popular Phillips-head screw was invented by American [[Henry F.

Sees and understands with a wisdom that is Godlike in its scale. I stand at the gates of her intellect and I am blinded by the light within.  How stupid I must seem to her.  How childlike and uncomprehending. Her soul is clean, untainted by the snares and ambiguities of emotion.  She does not hate. She does not yearn.  She is untouched by joy or sorrow. I worship her though I am not worthy. I cherish the purity of her disdain. She does not respect me. She does not fear me. She does not love me. They think she is hard and cold, those who do not know her. They think she is lifeless and without passion. They do not know her.  She has not touched them. She touches me, and I am touched by God, by Destiny. The whole of existence courses through her. I worship her.

The strip was one of the least popular in that title; editor/publisher [[Dez Skinn]] remarked, \"If I'd have given each character their own title, the failures would have certainly outweighed the successes, with the uncompromising 'V for Vendetta' probably being an early casualty. But with five or six strips an issue, regular [readers] only needed two or three favorites to justify their buying the title.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Allan|date=June 2009|title=Blood and Sapphires: The Rise and Demise of Marvelman|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=34|page=71|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen the publishers cancelled ''Warrior'' in 1985 (with two completed issues unpublished due to the cancellation), several companies attempted to convince Moore and Lloyd to let them publish and complete the story. In 1988, DC Comics published a ten-issue series that reprinted the ''Warrior'' stories in colour, then continued the series to completion. The first new material appeared in issue No. 7, which included the unpublished episodes that would have appeared in ''Warrior'' No. 27 and No. 28. [[Tony Weare]] drew one chapter (\"Vincent\") and contributed additional art to two others (\"Valerie\" and \"The Vacation\"); [[Steve Whitaker]] and Siobhan Dodds worked as [[Colorist|colourists]] on the entire series.\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe entire series has appeared [[trade paperback (comics)|collected]] in paperback ({{ISBN|0-446-39190-5}}) and hardback ({{ISBN|1-4012-0792-8}}) form, including Moore's \"Behind the Painted Smile\" essay and two \"interludes\" outside the central continuity.

Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:<blockquote>Na\u00efvet\u00e9 can also be detected in my supposition that it would take something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism...

Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by [[V (comics)|V]], a cloaked [[Anarchism|anarchist]] wearing a mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] before bringing Evey to his [[contraband]]-filled underground lair, the \"Shadow Gallery\". Evey tells V her life story, which reveals her own past as well as England's recent history. During a dispute over [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] in the late 1980s the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], under the [[President of the United States|presidency]] of [[Ted Kennedy]], entered a global [[nuclear war]] which left [[continental Europe]] and [[Africa]] uninhabitable. Although [[Britain]] itself was not bombed due to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's decision to remove [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom#US nuclear weapons in the UK|American nuclear missiles]], it faced environmental devastation and [[famine]] due to the [[nuclear winter]]. After a period of lawlessness in which Evey's mother died, the remaining [[corporation]]s and [[Fascism|fascist]] groups took over [[England]] and form a new [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, [[Norsefire]]. Evey's father, a former [[Socialism|socialist]], was arrested by the regime.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force\u2014\"the Nose\"\u2014begins investigating V's terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with Norsefire's other intelligence departments, including \"the Finger,\" led by Derek Almond, and \"the Head,\" embodied by <!-- NOT Sutler:: -->[[Adam Susan]]:<!-- ::NOT Sutler --> the reclusive government Leader, who obsessively oversees the government's ''Fate'' computer system. Finch's case thickens when V kidnaps Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality, and drives him into a [[mental breakdown]] by forcing him to relive his actions as the commander of a [[Death camp|\"resettlement\" camp]] near [[Larkhill]] with his treasured doll collection as inmates. Evey agrees to help V with his next assassination by disguising herself as a [[Child prostitution|child prostitute]] to infiltrate the home of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a <!-- preserve Commonwealth English spelling: Paedophile, not Paedophile: START -->[[paedophile]]<!-- END preserve Commonwealth English spelling: paedophile, not paedophile: --> priest, who V forces to commit suicide by eating a poisoned [[Sacramental bread|communion wafer]]. He prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at Larkhill. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge, but Surridge has left a diary revealing that V\u2014a former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experiments\u2014was able to destroy and flee the camp, and is now eliminating the camp's former officers for what they did. Finch reports these findings to Susan, and suspects that this vendetta may actually be a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.\n\n===Book 2: This Vicious Cabaret===\nFour months later, V breaks into Jordan Tower, the home of Norsefire's propaganda department, \"the Mouth\"\u2014led by Roger Dascombe\u2014to broadcast a speech that calls on the people to resist the government. V escapes using an elaborate diversion that results in Dascombe's death. Finch is soon introduced to Peter Creedy, the new head of the Finger, who provokes Finch to strike him and thus get sent on a forced vacation. All this time, Evey has moved on with her life, becoming romantically involved with a much older man named Gordon. Evey and Gordon unknowingly cross paths with Rose Almond, the widow of the recently killed Derek. After Derek's death, Rose reluctantly began a relationship with Dascombe, but now, with both of her lovers murdered, she is forced to perform demoralizing burlesque work, increasing her hatred of the unsupportive government.\n\nWhen a Scottish gangster named Ally Harper murders Gordon, a vengeful Evey interrupts a meeting between Harper and Creedy, the latter of whom is buying the support of Harper's thugs in preparation for a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Evey attempts to shoot Harper, but is suddenly abducted and then imprisoned. Amidst interrogation and [[torture]], Evey finds an old letter hidden in her cell by an inmate named Valerie Page, a film actress who was imprisoned and executed for being a lesbian.\n\nEvey's interrogator finally gives her a choice of collaboration or death; inspired by Valerie, Evey refuses to collaborate, and, expecting to be executed, is instead told that she is free. Stunned, Evey learns that her supposed imprisonment is in fact a hoax constructed by V so that she could experience an ordeal similar to the one that shaped him at Larkhill. He reveals that Valerie was a real Larkhill prisoner who died in the cell next to his and that the letter is not a fake. Evey forgives V, who has hacked into the government's ''Fate'' computer system and started emotionally manipulating Adam Susan with [[mind games]]. Consequently, Susan, who has formed a bizarre romantic attachment to the computer, is beginning to descend into madness.\n\n===Book 3: The Land of Do-As-You-Please===\nThe following 5 November (1998), V blows up the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] and Jordan Tower, killing \"the Ear\" leader Brian Etheridge; in addition to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth. Creedy's men and Harper's associated street gangs violently suppress the subsequent wave of revolutionary fervor from the public. V notes to Evey that he has not yet achieved what he calls the \"[[The Magic Faraway Tree (novel)#Lands In the Book|Land of Do-as-You-Please]]\", meaning a functional [[anarchy|anarchistic]] society, and considers the current [[chaos theory|chaotic]] situation an interim period of \"[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)#Lands in the book|Land of Take-What-You-Want]]\". Finch has been mysteriously absent and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the ''Fate'' computer all along, which explained V's consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been travelling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to conjure up memories of his own devastated past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V's experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V's lair is inside the abandoned [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], which he enters.\n\nV takes Finch by surprise, resulting in a scuffle which sees Finch shoot V and V wound Finch with a knife. V claims that he cannot be killed since he is only an idea and that \"ideas are bulletproof\"; regardless, V is indeed mortally wounded and returns to the Shadow Gallery deeper within, dying in Evey's arms. Evey considers unmasking V, but decides not to, realising that V is not an identity but a symbol. She then assumes V's identity, donning one of his spare costumes. Finch sees the large amount of blood that V has left in his wake and deduces that he has mortally wounded V. Occurring concurrently to this, Creedy has been pressuring Susan to appear in public, hoping to leave him exposed. Sure enough, as Susan stops to shake hands with Rose during a parade, she shoots him in the head in vengeance for the death of her husband and the life she has had to lead since then. Following Rose's arrest, Creedy assumes emergency leadership of the country, and Finch emerges from the subway proclaiming V's death.\n\nDue to his LSD-induced epiphany, Finch leaves his position within \"the Nose\". The power struggle between the remaining leaders results in all of their deaths: Harper betrays and kills Creedy at the behest of Helen Heyer (wife of \"the Eye\" leader Conrad Heyer, who had outbid Creedy for Harper's loyalty), and Harper and Conrad Heyer kill each other during a fight precipitated by Heyer's discovery that his wife Helen had had an affair with Harper.\n\nWith the fate of the top government officials unknown to the public, Stone acts as leader of the police forces deployed to ensure that the riots are contained should V still be alive and make his promised public announcement. Evey appears to a crowd, dressed as V, announcing the destruction of [[10 Downing Street]] the following day and telling the crowd they must ''\"...choose what comes next. Lives of your own, or a return to chains\"'', whereupon a general [[Insurgency|insurrection]] begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]]|penciller=[[David Lloyd (comics)|Lloyd, David]]|story=V for Vendetta|title=V for Vendetta|volume=10|date=May 1989|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=28|panel=6}}</ref> by blowing up an [[London Underground|Underground]] train containing V's body, in the style of an explosive [[Viking funeral]].

[[Natalie Portman]] stars as Evey Hammond and [[Hugo Weaving]] as V.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215126/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=vforvendetta.htm | archivedate=6 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlan Moore distanced himself from the film, as he has with other [[Alan Moore#Film adaptations|screen adaptation]] of his works. He ended co-operation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, [[Warner Bros.]], failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the movie.<ref name=\"slam\">{{cite web|title=Moore Slams V for Vendetta Movie, Pulls LoEG from DC Comics|date=22 April 2006|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=14937|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026235244/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article|archivedate=26 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter reading the script, Moore remarked:\n{{quote|[The movie] has been \"turned into a [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-era parable by people too timid to set a [[political satire]] in their own country. ... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by [[neoconservative]]s \u2013 which is not what the comic ''V for Vendetta'' was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.<ref>{{cite web|author=MTV|year=2006|title=Alan Moore: The last angry man|work=MTV.com|url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315|access-date=August 30, 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901005535/http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/|archivedate=1 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nHe later adds that if the Wachowskis had wanted to protest about what was going on in the United States, then they should have used a political narrative that directly addressed the issues of the US, similar to what Moore had done before with Britain. The film arguably changes the original message by having removed any reference to actual [[anarchism]] in the revolutionary actions of V. An interview with producer [[Joel Silver]] reveals that he identifies the V of the comics as a clear-cut \"superhero... a masked avenger who pretty much saves the world,\" a simplification that goes against Moore's own statements about V's role in the story.<ref>{{cite web|author=Douglas, Edward|year=2006|title=V for Vendetta's Silver Lining|work=Comingsoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13588|access-date=6 April 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418063354/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13588|archivedate=18 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCo-author and illustrator David Lloyd, by contrast, embraced the adaptation.<ref>{{cite web|title=V at Comic Con|url=http://pdl.warnerbros.com/wbmovies/vforvendetta/comiccon_text.html|access-date=2006-04-06|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507074202/http://pdl.warnerbros.com/wbmovies/vforvendetta/comiccon_text.html|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Newsarama]]'' he states:{{bquote|It's a terrific film.

I worship her though I am not worthy. I cherish the purity of her disdain. She does not respect me. She does not fear me. She does not love me. They think she is hard and cold, those who do not know her. They think she is lifeless and without passion. They do not know her.  She has not touched them.

The strip was one of the least popular in that title; editor/publisher [[Dez Skinn]] remarked, \"If I'd have given each character their own title, the failures would have certainly outweighed the successes, with the uncompromising 'V for Vendetta' probably being an early casualty. But with five or six strips an issue, regular [readers] only needed two or three favorites to justify their buying the title.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Allan|date=June 2009|title=Blood and Sapphires: The Rise and Demise of Marvelman|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=34|page=71|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen the publishers cancelled ''Warrior'' in 1985 (with two completed issues unpublished due to the cancellation), several companies attempted to convince Moore and Lloyd to let them publish and complete the story. In 1988, DC Comics published a ten-issue series that reprinted the ''Warrior'' stories in colour, then continued the series to completion. The first new material appeared in issue No. 7, which included the unpublished episodes that would have appeared in ''Warrior'' No. 27 and No. 28. [[Tony Weare]] drew one chapter (\"Vincent\") and contributed additional art to two others (\"Valerie\" and \"The Vacation\"); [[Steve Whitaker]] and Siobhan Dodds worked as [[Colorist|colourists]] on the entire series.\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe entire series has appeared [[trade paperback (comics)|collected]] in paperback ({{ISBN|0-446-39190-5}}) and hardback ({{ISBN|1-4012-0792-8}}) form, including Moore's \"Behind the Painted Smile\" essay and two \"interludes\" outside the central continuity. Later collections include reissued paperbacks, published in the US by DC's [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint ({{ISBN|0-930289-52-8}}) and in the UK by [[Titan Books]] ({{ISBN|1-85286-291-2}}).

Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by [[V (comics)|V]], a cloaked [[Anarchism|anarchist]] wearing a mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] before bringing Evey to his [[contraband]]-filled underground lair, the \"Shadow Gallery\". Evey tells V her life story, which reveals her own past as well as England's recent history. During a dispute over [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] in the late 1980s the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], under the [[President of the United States|presidency]] of [[Ted Kennedy]], entered a global [[nuclear war]] which left [[continental Europe]] and [[Africa]] uninhabitable. Although Britain itself was not bombed due to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's decision to remove [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom#US nuclear weapons in the UK|American nuclear missiles]], it faced environmental devastation and [[famine]] due to the [[nuclear winter]]. After a period of lawlessness in which Evey's mother died, the remaining [[corporation]]s and [[Fascism|fascist]] groups took over England and form a new [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, [[Norsefire]]. Evey's father, a former [[Socialism|socialist]], was arrested by the regime.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force\u2014\"the Nose\"\u2014begins investigating V's terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with Norsefire's other intelligence departments, including \"the Finger,\" led by Derek Almond, and \"the Head,\" embodied by <!-- NOT Sutler:: -->[[Adam Susan]]:<!-- ::NOT Sutler --> the reclusive government Leader, who obsessively oversees the government's ''Fate'' computer system. Finch's case thickens when V kidnaps Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality, and drives him into a [[mental breakdown]] by forcing him to relive his actions as the commander of a [[Death camp|\"resettlement\" camp]] near [[Larkhill]] with his treasured doll collection as inmates. Evey agrees to help V with his next assassination by disguising herself as a [[Child prostitution|child prostitute]] to infiltrate the home of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a <!-- preserve Commonwealth English spelling: Paedophile, not Paedophile: START -->[[paedophile]]<!-- END preserve Commonwealth English spelling: paedophile, not paedophile: --> priest, who V forces to commit suicide by eating a poisoned [[Sacramental bread|communion wafer]]. He prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at Larkhill. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge, but Surridge has left a diary revealing that V\u2014a former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experiments\u2014was able to destroy and flee the camp, and is now eliminating the camp's former officers for what they did. Finch reports these findings to Susan, and suspects that this vendetta may actually be a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.\n\n===Book 2: This Vicious Cabaret===\nFour months later, V breaks into Jordan Tower, the home of Norsefire's propaganda department, \"the Mouth\"\u2014led by Roger Dascombe\u2014to broadcast a speech that calls on the people to resist the government. V escapes using an elaborate diversion that results in Dascombe's death. Finch is soon introduced to Peter Creedy, the new head of the Finger, who provokes Finch to strike him and thus get sent on a forced vacation. All this time, Evey has moved on with her life, becoming romantically involved with a much older man named Gordon. Evey and Gordon unknowingly cross paths with Rose Almond, the widow of the recently killed Derek. After Derek's death, Rose reluctantly began a relationship with Dascombe, but now, with both of her lovers murdered, she is forced to perform demoralizing burlesque work, increasing her hatred of the unsupportive government.\n\nWhen a Scottish gangster named Ally Harper murders Gordon, a vengeful Evey interrupts a meeting between Harper and Creedy, the latter of whom is buying the support of Harper's thugs in preparation for a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Evey attempts to shoot Harper, but is suddenly abducted and then imprisoned. Amidst interrogation and [[torture]], Evey finds an old letter hidden in her cell by an inmate named Valerie Page, a film actress who was imprisoned and executed for being a lesbian.\n\nEvey's interrogator finally gives her a choice of collaboration or death; inspired by Valerie, Evey refuses to collaborate, and, expecting to be executed, is instead told that she is free. Stunned, Evey learns that her supposed imprisonment is in fact a hoax constructed by V so that she could experience an ordeal similar to the one that shaped him at Larkhill. He reveals that Valerie was a real Larkhill prisoner who died in the cell next to his and that the letter is not a fake. Evey forgives V, who has hacked into the government's ''Fate'' computer system and started emotionally manipulating Adam Susan with [[mind games]]. Consequently, Susan, who has formed a bizarre romantic attachment to the computer, is beginning to descend into madness.\n\n===Book 3: The Land of Do-As-You-Please===\nThe following 5 November (1998), V blows up the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] and Jordan Tower, killing \"the Ear\" leader Brian Etheridge; in addition to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth. Creedy's men and Harper's associated street gangs violently suppress the subsequent wave of revolutionary fervor from the public. V notes to Evey that he has not yet achieved what he calls the \"[[The Magic Faraway Tree (novel)#Lands In the Book|Land of Do-as-You-Please]]\", meaning a functional [[anarchy|anarchistic]] society, and considers the current [[chaos theory|chaotic]] situation an interim period of \"[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)#Lands in the book|Land of Take-What-You-Want]]\". Finch has been mysteriously absent and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the ''Fate'' computer all along, which explained V's consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been travelling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to conjure up memories of his own devastated past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V's experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V's lair is inside the abandoned [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], which he enters.\n\nV takes Finch by surprise, resulting in a scuffle which sees Finch shoot V and V wound Finch with a knife. V claims that he cannot be killed since he is only an idea and that \"ideas are bulletproof\"; regardless, V is indeed mortally wounded and returns to the Shadow Gallery deeper within, dying in Evey's arms. Evey considers unmasking V, but decides not to, realising that V is not an identity but a symbol. She then assumes V's identity, donning one of his spare costumes. Finch sees the large amount of blood that V has left in his wake and deduces that he has mortally wounded V. Occurring concurrently to this, Creedy has been pressuring Susan to appear in public, hoping to leave him exposed. Sure enough, as Susan stops to shake hands with Rose during a parade, she shoots him in the head in vengeance for the death of her husband and the life she has had to lead since then. Following Rose's arrest, Creedy assumes emergency leadership of the country, and Finch emerges from the subway proclaiming V's death.\n\nDue to his LSD-induced epiphany, Finch leaves his position within \"the Nose\". The power struggle between the remaining leaders results in all of their deaths: Harper betrays and kills Creedy at the behest of Helen Heyer (wife of \"the Eye\" leader Conrad Heyer, who had outbid Creedy for Harper's loyalty), and Harper and Conrad Heyer kill each other during a fight precipitated by Heyer's discovery that his wife Helen had had an affair with Harper.\n\nWith the fate of the top government officials unknown to the public, Stone acts as leader of the police forces deployed to ensure that the riots are contained should V still be alive and make his promised public announcement. Evey appears to a crowd, dressed as V, announcing the destruction of [[10 Downing Street]] the following day and telling the crowd they must ''\"...choose what comes next. Lives of your own, or a return to chains\"'', whereupon a general [[Insurgency|insurrection]] begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]]|penciller=[[David Lloyd (comics)|Lloyd, David]]|story=V for Vendetta|title=V for Vendetta|volume=10|date=May 1989|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=28|panel=6}}</ref> by blowing up an [[London Underground|Underground]] train containing V's body, in the style of an explosive [[Viking funeral]]. She abducts Stone, apparently to train him as her successor. The book ends with Finch quietly observing the chaos raging in the city and walking down an abandoned motorway whose lights have all gone out.\n\n===Norsefire government===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Norsefire government officials in ''V for Vendetta''\n|-\n!

It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by [[neoconservative]]s \u2013 which is not what the comic ''V for Vendetta'' was about.

The film arguably changes the original message by having removed any reference to actual [[anarchism]] in the revolutionary actions of V. An interview with producer [[Joel Silver]] reveals that he identifies the V of the comics as a clear-cut \"superhero... a masked avenger who pretty much saves the world,\" a simplification that goes against Moore's own statements about V's role in the story.<ref>{{cite web|author=Douglas, Edward|year=2006|title=V for Vendetta's Silver Lining|work=Comingsoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13588|access-date=6 April 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418063354/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13588|archivedate=18 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCo-author and illustrator David Lloyd, by contrast, embraced the adaptation.<ref>{{cite web|title=V at Comic Con|url=http://pdl.warnerbros.com/wbmovies/vforvendetta/comiccon_text.html|access-date=2006-04-06|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507074202/http://pdl.warnerbros.com/wbmovies/vforvendetta/comiccon_text.html|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Newsarama]]'' he states:{{bquote|It's a terrific film.

He realized the importance of disseminating the message of Islam in North America in English, especially to the youth.  While numerous scholars and religious leaders performed a good job reaching out to the Arabic speaking members of the community, the English-speaking generations needed someone who was capable of communicating with them, and so al-Qazwini devoted himself to learning and acquiring a fair grasp of the English language quickly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Dearborn ====\nIn early 1993, al-Qazwini was invited by the Islamic Center of America (ICA) in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]]; the oldest Shia mosque in the United States, as a guest speaker for the Arabic program during [[Ramadan]], where the local community quickly found him responsive to their spiritual and religious needs.

The women are joined by newcomer Anna, who is of [[Mixed ancestry|mixed Mohawk descent]].\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series begins with Bailey moving into her aunt's house after her uncle runs off with a younger woman. Bailey is in a serious relationship with Thunder, but after she introduces him to her father she learns that they are actually cousins. Bailey begins the search for a new boyfriend but finds the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] men she meets dull.\n\nCaitlin meanwhile falls in love with Butterhead, a sleazy [[lacrosse]] player who already has two children with two different women. Though she is able to separate him from his partner she struggles to keep his attention when younger women begin flirting with him.\n\nZoe, a successful lawyer, struggles against parental pressure to uphold her image and be a flawless example for the Mohawk community.\n\nAfter years spent in New York Anna returns to [[Kahnawake]] and finds that the small community is less than welcoming to a free-spirited vlogger.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-hello-mohawk-girls-you-rock-and-youre-funny/article21698855/ \"John Doyle: Hello Mohawk Girls, you rock and you\u2019re funny\"].

While she is initially terrified at the prospect of being a single mother she finds that Butterhead isn't much better as an involved father when they move into his mother's home.\n\nZoe fully embraces her fetish side and becomes involved in the bondage scene.\n\nAnna begins dating Thunder after finally standing up to Bailey but faces the disapproval of everyone else inside the community and develops [[PTSD]] after being jumped by Vicky.\n\n===Season 3===\nBailey has an affair with Lollipop's husband but eventually ends it and decides to move back to the reservation to refocus her life. She focuses on finding a Mohawk man once again.\n\nCaitlin has mixed feelings about aborting her child with Butterhead but eventually focuses on self-improvement and leaves Butterhead.\n\nZoe deals with the consequences of her freakout at Lollipop's wedding by ingratiating herself to her and even getting a boyfriend to prove she can be normal and not uptight.\n\nAnna reunites with Thunder and continues to learn more about Mohawk culture despite being exposed as being only 48% Mohawk.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nBailey navigates wedding planning, commitment, and living with Watio. This is hard when she also has growing feelings for her painting instructor, James in Montreal. She also tries to break into a real career, but struggles.\n\nCaitlin loves the respect and encouragement she has from her flourishing relationship with Leon; unfortunately, her family and community are not supportive of her dating a black man.\n\nZoe begins seeing a psychologist who believes Zoe is dealing with a sex addiction, but Zoe denies this. She decides to run for Chief and get a boyfriend to make up for not showing up to a fundraiser she planned poorly; this does not go as well as she would have liked when she tries to balance her career and personal life with a \"Master\" in Montreal.\n\nAnna tries to fit in with the community, and does better when she drops out of school and disrespects her white mother in front of the town. This leads to Thunder breaking up with her, and Anna gradually loses more and more as she tries to prove she deserves the name \"Fauxhawk\" instead of \"Hat girl\".\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n*Jennifer Pudavick as '''Bailey''', a woman in her late-twenties who works at a cigarette factory.

The women are joined by newcomer Anna, who is of [[Mixed ancestry|mixed Mohawk descent]].\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series begins with Bailey moving into her aunt's house after her uncle runs off with a younger woman. Bailey is in a serious relationship with Thunder, but after she introduces him to her father she learns that they are actually cousins. Bailey begins the search for a new boyfriend but finds the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] men she meets dull.\n\nCaitlin meanwhile falls in love with Butterhead, a sleazy [[lacrosse]] player who already has two children with two different women. Though she is able to separate him from his partner she struggles to keep his attention when younger women begin flirting with him.\n\nZoe, a successful lawyer, struggles against parental pressure to uphold her image and be a flawless example for the Mohawk community.\n\nAfter years spent in New York Anna returns to [[Kahnawake]] and finds that the small community is less than welcoming to a free-spirited vlogger.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-hello-mohawk-girls-you-rock-and-youre-funny/article21698855/ \"John Doyle: Hello Mohawk Girls, you rock and you\u2019re funny\"]. John Doyle, ''The Globe and Mail'', Nov. 21, 2014</ref>\n\n===Season 2===\nThe second season follows the women as their love lives become messier.\n\nBailey, who finally stands up to her friends and family and brings Jack to meet them, is crushed when Jack breaks up with her after her family threatens him.\n\nCaitlin becomes pregnant with Butterhead's child. While she is initially terrified at the prospect of being a single mother she finds that Butterhead isn't much better as an involved father when they move into his mother's home.\n\nZoe fully embraces her fetish side and becomes involved in the bondage scene.\n\nAnna begins dating Thunder after finally standing up to Bailey but faces the disapproval of everyone else inside the community and develops [[PTSD]] after being jumped by Vicky.\n\n===Season 3===\nBailey has an affair with Lollipop's husband but eventually ends it and decides to move back to the reservation to refocus her life. She focuses on finding a Mohawk man once again.\n\nCaitlin has mixed feelings about aborting her child with Butterhead but eventually focuses on self-improvement and leaves Butterhead.\n\nZoe deals with the consequences of her freakout at Lollipop's wedding by ingratiating herself to her and even getting a boyfriend to prove she can be normal and not uptight.\n\nAnna reunites with Thunder and continues to learn more about Mohawk culture despite being exposed as being only 48% Mohawk.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nBailey navigates wedding planning, commitment, and living with Watio. This is hard when she also has growing feelings for her painting instructor, James in Montreal. She also tries to break into a real career, but struggles.\n\nCaitlin loves the respect and encouragement she has from her flourishing relationship with Leon; unfortunately, her family and community are not supportive of her dating a black man.\n\nZoe begins seeing a psychologist who believes Zoe is dealing with a sex addiction, but Zoe denies this. She decides to run for Chief and get a boyfriend to make up for not showing up to a fundraiser she planned poorly; this does not go as well as she would have liked when she tries to balance her career and personal life with a \"Master\" in Montreal.\n\nAnna tries to fit in with the community, and does better when she drops out of school and disrespects her white mother in front of the town. This leads to Thunder breaking up with her, and Anna gradually loses more and more as she tries to prove she deserves the name \"Fauxhawk\" instead of \"Hat girl\".\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n*Jennifer Pudavick as '''Bailey''', a woman in her late-twenties who works at a cigarette factory.
