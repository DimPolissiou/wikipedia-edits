[[Cultural universal|All human cultures]] have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible [[Sexual partner|sexual]] or [[marriage]] partners, making such relationships [[taboo]]. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. Sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called [[Incest|incestuous relationship]]s.''\n\nSome cultures proscribe sexual relations between [[clan]]-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother\u2013sister marriages have been practised by the elites with some regularity. Parent\u2013child and sibling\u2013sibling unions are almost universally taboo.<ref>''The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology'', Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|9780759111394}}. p.101</ref>\n\n==Source of the taboo==\nDebate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in [[nature or nurture]].\n\nOne explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since [[inbreeding]] may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called [[Westermarck effect]] discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.<ref name=WolfDurham2005>''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', Arthur P. Wolf and William H. Durham (Editors),  Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0804751414}}. Introduction</ref>\n\nAnother school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group [[exogamy]], which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable [[Alliance theory|alliances]] that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over [[endogamy]], and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Limits to biological evolution of taboo===\nWhile it is theoretically possible that [[natural selection]] may, under certain [[genetics|genetic]] circumstances, select for individuals that [[instinct]]ively avoid mating with (close) relatives, biological evolution cannot select for punishing others for incest, since even genetically weakened, [[inbreeding|inbred]] individuals are better watchposts against [[predator]]s than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals.<ref>E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998</ref><ref>The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design, Richard Dawkins, 1986</ref>{{Dubious}} Punishing both parties in an incestous relation cannot even be beneficial for the genes of individuals punishing a somewhat more distant relative for mating with a closer relative, since punishing the closer relative as well is counterproductive to any function of protecting the closer relative and the health of its offspring (in a context where predation and [[starvation]] are significant factors, as opposed to a rich [[welfare state]]).<ref>Gorrell J.C., McAdam A.G., Coltman D.W., Humphries M.M., Boutin S., Jamieson C.; McAdam, Andrew G.; Coltman, David W.; Humphries, Murray M.; Boutin, Stan (June 2010). \"Adopting kin enhances inclusive fitness in asocial red squirrels\".

Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society.<ref>Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 253</ref> The following excerpt from ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'' (1951), a well-established field manual for [[ethnographic]] research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:\n\n{{quote|''Incest is sexual intercourse between individuals related in certain prohibited degrees of [[kinship]].'' In every society there are rules prohibiting incestuous unions, both as to sexual intercourse and recognized marriage. The two prohibitions do not necessarily coincide. There is no uniformity as to which degrees are involved in the prohibitions. The rules regulating incest must be investigated in every society by means of the [[genealogical method]]. The prohibition may be so narrow as to include only one type of parent\u2013child relationship (though this is very rare), or those within the elementary family; or so wide as to include all with whom genealogical or classificatory kinship can be traced. The more usual practice is that unions with certain relatives only are considered incestuous, the relationships being regulated by the type of descent emphasized. In some societies unions with certain persons related by [[affinity (law)|affinity]] are also considered incestuous.\n\nWhat penalties fall on (a) the individuals concerned; (b) the community as a whole? Are such penalties enforced by authority, or are they believed to ensure automatically by all action of supernatural force?  Is there any correlation between the severity of the penalty and the nearness of the blood-tie of the partners in guilt? Should children be born as the result of incestuous unions, how are they treated? Are there any methods, ritual or legal, by which persons who fall within the prohibited degrees and wish to marry can break the relationship and become free to marry?<ref>A Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1951. ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'', 6th edition. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, Ltd. p. 113\u2013114</ref>}}\n\nAs this excerpt suggests, anthropologists distinguish between social norms and actual social behavior; much social theory explores the difference and relationship between the two. For example, what is the purpose of prohibitions that are routinely violated (as for example when people claim that incest is taboo yet engage in incestuous behavior)?\n\nIt should be further noted that in these theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother\u2013sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.\n\nMoreover, the definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in [[Bali]], mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breast-feeding.<ref>Briggs, Jean Louise ''Never in anger: portrait of an Eskimo family'' 1970 Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.)</ref><ref>Gregory Bateson, ''Steps to an ecology of mind: collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution, and epistemology'' preface by Mark Engel 1972 Chandler, San Francisco 112\u2013115</ref>\n\nIt should also be noted that, in these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying \"incest\" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by \"incest\", and what the consequences of \"incest\" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.\n\nThis excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.\n\nFor example, [[Trobriand Islanders]] prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother,<ref>Bronislow Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 389, 392</ref> and between a woman and her father,<ref name=Malinowski29>Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 384</ref> but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not.<ref name=Malinowski29/> This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not.<ref>Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 450\u2013451</ref>  A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.<ref>Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 449\u2013450</ref>\n\n===Instinctual and genetic explanations===\n{{technical|section|date=August 2015}}\nAn explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse [[Heredity|genetic effects]] of [[inbreeding]] such as a higher incidence of congenital [[birth defect]]s (see article [[Inbreeding depression]]). Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.<ref>Alexander, Richard 1977 \"Natural Selection and the Analyusis of Human Sociology\" in ''The Changing Scenes in the Natural Sciences, 1776\u20131976'' pp. 283\u2013337 Academy of Natural Science Special Publication 12</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bittles | display-authors = etal  | year = 1991 | title = Reproductive Behavior and Health in Consangueneous Marriages | url = | journal = Science | volume = 2 | issue = 52| pages = 789\u2013794 | doi = 10.1126/science.2028254 | pmid = 2028254 | bibcode = 1991Sci...252..789B }}</ref><ref name=\"doi10.1038/ng1094-117\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bittles | first1 = A.

Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population.\n\nIn small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to ''decrease'' the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects.<ref>Thornhill, Nancy, ed. 1993 ''The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding''. Chicago: UNiversity of Chicago Press</ref> Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain [[immune system]]s genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Lieberman |first2=Debra |last3=Santtila |first3=Pekka |title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2012 |volume=7 |issue=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |pages=e50613 |pmid=23209792 |pmc=3509093|bibcode=2012PLoSO...750613A }}</ref> Children born of close relatives have decreased survival.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/ng1094-117\"/><ref name=\"moral\"/> Many mammal species, including humanity's closest [[primate]] relatives, avoid incest.<ref name=\"WolfDurham2005\"/>\n\n====Westermarck effect====\n{{main|Westermarck effect}}\nThe [[Westermarck effect]], first proposed by [[Edvard Westermarck]] in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic.<ref>Westermarck, Edvard A.

For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness.<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer.

Stewart-Williams argues that these marriages were largely political (their function being to keep power and wealth concentrated in the family) and there is no evidence the siblings were attracted to each other and there is in fact some evidence against it (for example, [[Cleopatra]] married two of her brothers but did not have children with them, only having children with unrelated lovers). Stewart-Williams suggests that this was therefore simply a case of social pressure overriding anti-incest instincts. Stewart-Williams also observes that anti-incest behaviour has been observed in other animals and even many plant species (many plants could self-pollinate but have mechanisms that prevent them from doing so).<ref>Stewart-Williams, Steve.

Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp 135-136</ref>\n\n===Sociological explanations===\n[[Psychoanalytic theory]]\u2014in particular, the claimed existence of an [[Oedipus complex]], which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire\u2014has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.<ref name=WolfDurham2005/>\n\n====Exogamy====\nThe anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against [[endogamy]], and the effect is to encourage [[exogamy]]. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, L\u00e9vi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on [[Marcel Mauss]]'s theory of ''[[The Gift (Mauss book)|The Gift]]'', which (in L\u00e9vi-Strauss' words) argued:\n\n{{quote|that exchange in primitive societies consists not so much in economic transactions as in reciprocal gifts, that these reciprocal gifts have a far more important function than in our own, and that this primitive form of exchange is not merely nor essentially of an economic nature but is what he aptly calls \"a total social fact\", that is, an event which has a significance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, utilitarian and sentimental, jural and moral.<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 52</ref>}}\n\nIt is also based on L\u00e9vi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. L\u00e9vi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by [[Margaret Mead]] during her research among the [[Arapesh]]. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: \"No we don't sleep with our sisters. We give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters.\" Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. L\u00e9vi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:\n\n{{quote|What, you would like to marry your sister? What is the matter with you anyway? Don't you want a brother-in-law? Don't you realize that if you marry another man's sister and another man marries your sister, you will have at least two brothers-in-law, while if you marry your own sister you will have none? With whom will you hunt, with whom will you garden, who will you visit?<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969  ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 485</ref>}}\n\nBy applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, L\u00e9vi-Strauss proposed what he called [[alliance theory]]. He argued that, in \"primitive\" societies, marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship\u2014an alliance\u2014between two men.<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 492-496</ref> His ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' takes this as a starting point and uses it to analyze kinship systems of increasing complexity found in so-called primitive societies (that is, those not based on agriculture, class inequalities, and centralized government).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThis theory was debated intensely by anthropologists in the 1950s. It appealed to many because it used the study of incest taboos and marriage to answer more fundamental research interests of anthropologists at the time: how can an anthropologist map out the social relationships within a given community, and how do these relationships promote or endanger social solidarity?<ref>H. Befu \"Social Exchange\" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Volume 6, Page 255\u2013281, Oct 1977</ref><ref>M.G. Peletz \"Kinship Studies in Late Twentieth-Century Anthropology\" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology.'' Volume 24, Page 343\u2013372, Oct 1995</ref> Nevertheless, anthropologists never reached a consensus, and with the [[Vietnam War]] and the process of [[decolonization]] in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, anthropological interests shifted away from mapping local social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nSome anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Gregory | year = 1989 | title = Disappearance of the Incest Taboo | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 116\u2013131 | doi=10.1525/aa.1989.91.1.02a00070}}</ref>\n\nWhile L\u00e9vi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing L\u00e9vi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.<ref>Spencer, Paul. 1988. ''The Maasai of Matapato: a Study of Rituals of Rebellion'', Manchester University Press, Manchester.</ref>\n\n====Endogamy====\nExogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in [[Classless society|classless societies]]. Societies that are stratified\u2014that is, divided into unequal classes\u2014often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group.

[[Cultural universal|All human cultures]] have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible [[Sexual partner|sexual]] or [[marriage]] partners, making such relationships [[taboo]]. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. Sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called [[Incest|incestuous relationship]]s.''\n\nSome cultures proscribe sexual relations between [[clan]]-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother\u2013sister marriages have been practised by the elites with some regularity. Parent\u2013child and sibling\u2013sibling unions are almost universally taboo.<ref>''The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology'', Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|9780759111394}}. p.101</ref>\n\n==Source of the taboo==\nDebate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in [[nature or nurture]].\n\nOne explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since [[inbreeding]] may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called [[Westermarck effect]] discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.<ref name=WolfDurham2005>''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', Arthur P. Wolf and William H. Durham (Editors),  Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0804751414}}. Introduction</ref>\n\nAnother school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group [[exogamy]], which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable [[Alliance theory|alliances]] that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over [[endogamy]], and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Limits to biological evolution of taboo===\nWhile it is theoretically possible that [[natural selection]] may, under certain [[genetics|genetic]] circumstances, select for individuals that [[instinct]]ively avoid mating with (close) relatives, biological evolution cannot select for punishing others for incest, since even genetically weakened, [[inbreeding|inbred]] individuals are better watchposts against [[predator]]s than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals.<ref>E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998</ref><ref>The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design, Richard Dawkins, 1986</ref> Punishing both parties in an incestous relation cannot even be beneficial for the genes of individuals punishing a somewhat more distant relative for mating with a closer relative, since punishing the closer relative as well is counterproductive to any function of protecting the closer relative and the health of its offspring (in a context where predation and [[starvation]] are significant factors, as opposed to a rich [[welfare state]]).<ref>Gorrell J.C., McAdam A.G., Coltman D.W., Humphries M.M., Boutin S., Jamieson C.; McAdam, Andrew G.; Coltman, David W.; Humphries, Murray M.; Boutin, Stan (June 2010). \"Adopting kin enhances inclusive fitness in asocial red squirrels\".

Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society.<ref>Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 253</ref> The following excerpt from ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'' (1951), a well-established field manual for [[ethnographic]] research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:\n\n{{quote|''Incest is sexual intercourse between individuals related in certain prohibited degrees of [[kinship]].'' In every society there are rules prohibiting incestuous unions, both as to sexual intercourse and recognized marriage. The two prohibitions do not necessarily coincide. There is no uniformity as to which degrees are involved in the prohibitions. The rules regulating incest must be investigated in every society by means of the [[genealogical method]]. The prohibition may be so narrow as to include only one type of parent\u2013child relationship (though this is very rare), or those within the elementary family; or so wide as to include all with whom genealogical or classificatory kinship can be traced. The more usual practice is that unions with certain relatives only are considered incestuous, the relationships being regulated by the type of descent emphasized. In some societies unions with certain persons related by [[affinity (law)|affinity]] are also considered incestuous.\n\nWhat penalties fall on (a) the individuals concerned; (b) the community as a whole? Are such penalties enforced by authority, or are they believed to ensure automatically by all action of supernatural force?  Is there any correlation between the severity of the penalty and the nearness of the blood-tie of the partners in guilt? Should children be born as the result of incestuous unions, how are they treated? Are there any methods, ritual or legal, by which persons who fall within the prohibited degrees and wish to marry can break the relationship and become free to marry?<ref>A Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1951. ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'', 6th edition. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, Ltd. p. 113\u2013114</ref>}}\n\nAs this excerpt suggests, anthropologists distinguish between social norms and actual social behavior; much social theory explores the difference and relationship between the two. For example, what is the purpose of prohibitions that are routinely violated (as for example when people claim that incest is taboo yet engage in incestuous behavior)?\n\nIt should be further noted that in these theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother\u2013sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.\n\nMoreover, the definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in [[Bali]], mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breast-feeding.<ref>Briggs, Jean Louise ''Never in anger: portrait of an Eskimo family'' 1970 Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.)</ref><ref>Gregory Bateson, ''Steps to an ecology of mind: collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution, and epistemology'' preface by Mark Engel 1972 Chandler, San Francisco 112\u2013115</ref>\n\nIt should also be noted that, in these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying \"incest\" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by \"incest\", and what the consequences of \"incest\" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.\n\nThis excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.\n\nFor example, [[Trobriand Islanders]] prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother,<ref>Bronislow Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 389, 392</ref> and between a woman and her father,<ref name=Malinowski29>Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 384</ref> but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not.<ref name=Malinowski29/> This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not.<ref>Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 450\u2013451</ref>  A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.<ref>Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 449\u2013450</ref>\n\n===Instinctual and genetic explanations===\n{{technical|section|date=August 2015}}\nAn explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse [[Heredity|genetic effects]] of [[inbreeding]] such as a higher incidence of congenital [[birth defect]]s (see article [[Inbreeding depression]]).

Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population.\n\nIn small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to ''decrease'' the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects.<ref>Thornhill, Nancy, ed. 1993 ''The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding''. Chicago: UNiversity of Chicago Press</ref> Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain [[immune system]]s genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Lieberman |first2=Debra |last3=Santtila |first3=Pekka |title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2012 |volume=7 |issue=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |pages=e50613 |pmid=23209792 |pmc=3509093|bibcode=2012PLoSO...750613A }}</ref> Children born of close relatives have decreased survival.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/ng1094-117\"/><ref name=\"moral\"/> Many mammal species, including humanity's closest [[primate]] relatives, avoid incest.<ref name=\"WolfDurham2005\"/>\n\n====Westermarck effect====\n{{main|Westermarck effect}}\nThe [[Westermarck effect]], first proposed by [[Edvard Westermarck]] in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic.<ref>Westermarck, Edvard A.

For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness.<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer.

Stewart-Williams argues that these marriages were largely political (their function being to keep power and wealth concentrated in the family) and there is no evidence the siblings were attracted to each other and there is in fact some evidence against it (for example, [[Cleopatra]] married two of her brothers but did not have children with them, only having children with unrelated lovers). Stewart-Williams suggests that this was therefore simply a case of social pressure overriding anti-incest instincts. Stewart-Williams also observes that anti-incest behaviour has been observed in other animals and even many plant species (many plants could self-pollinate but have mechanisms that prevent them from doing so).<ref>Stewart-Williams, Steve.

His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against [[endogamy]], and the effect is to encourage [[exogamy]]. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, L\u00e9vi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on [[Marcel Mauss]]'s theory of ''[[The Gift (Mauss book)|The Gift]]'', which (in L\u00e9vi-Strauss' words) argued:\n\n{{quote|that exchange in primitive societies consists not so much in economic transactions as in reciprocal gifts, that these reciprocal gifts have a far more important function than in our own, and that this primitive form of exchange is not merely nor essentially of an economic nature but is what he aptly calls \"a total social fact\", that is, an event which has a significance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, utilitarian and sentimental, jural and moral.<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 52</ref>}}\n\nIt is also based on L\u00e9vi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. L\u00e9vi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by [[Margaret Mead]] during her research among the [[Arapesh]]. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: \"No we don't sleep with our sisters. We give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters.\" Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. L\u00e9vi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:\n\n{{quote|What, you would like to marry your sister? What is the matter with you anyway? Don't you want a brother-in-law? Don't you realize that if you marry another man's sister and another man marries your sister, you will have at least two brothers-in-law, while if you marry your own sister you will have none? With whom will you hunt, with whom will you garden, who will you visit?<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969  ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 485</ref>}}\n\nBy applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, L\u00e9vi-Strauss proposed what he called [[alliance theory]]. He argued that, in \"primitive\" societies, marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship\u2014an alliance\u2014between two men.<ref>Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 492-496</ref> His ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' takes this as a starting point and uses it to analyze kinship systems of increasing complexity found in so-called primitive societies (that is, those not based on agriculture, class inequalities, and centralized government).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThis theory was debated intensely by anthropologists in the 1950s. It appealed to many because it used the study of incest taboos and marriage to answer more fundamental research interests of anthropologists at the time: how can an anthropologist map out the social relationships within a given community, and how do these relationships promote or endanger social solidarity?<ref>H. Befu \"Social Exchange\" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Volume 6, Page 255\u2013281, Oct 1977</ref><ref>M.G. Peletz \"Kinship Studies in Late Twentieth-Century Anthropology\" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology.'' Volume 24, Page 343\u2013372, Oct 1995</ref> Nevertheless, anthropologists never reached a consensus, and with the [[Vietnam War]] and the process of [[decolonization]] in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, anthropological interests shifted away from mapping local social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nSome anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Gregory | year = 1989 | title = Disappearance of the Incest Taboo | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 116\u2013131 | doi=10.1525/aa.1989.91.1.02a00070}}</ref>\n\nWhile L\u00e9vi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing L\u00e9vi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.<ref>Spencer, Paul. 1988. ''The Maasai of Matapato: a Study of Rituals of Rebellion'', Manchester University Press, Manchester.</ref>\n\n====Endogamy====\nExogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in [[Classless society|classless societies]]. Societies that are stratified\u2014that is, divided into unequal classes\u2014often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. A classic example is [[India]]'s [[caste system]], in which unequal castes are endogamous.<ref>Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 311</ref> Inequality between [[ethnic group]]s and [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] also correlates with endogamy.<ref>Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 317\u2013318</ref> \n\nAn extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother\u2013sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bixler | first1 = Ray | year = 1982 | title = Comment on the Incidence and Purpose of Royal Sibling Incest | url = | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 580\u2013582 | doi=10.1525/ae.1982.9.3.02a00100}}</ref> Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners,<ref>{{cite web | first = Ashley | last = Jones | title = Incest in Ancient Egypt | url = http://cnersundergraduatejournal.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/incest_in_ancient_egypt_revised_.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Strong | first = Anise | title = Incest Laws and Absent Taboos in Roman Egypt | journal = Ancient History Bulletin | volume = 20 | year = 2006 | url = https://www.academia.edu/205164}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = N. | title = Life in Egypt under Roman Rule | isbn = 0-19-814848-8 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] | year = 1983 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeinegyptunder0000lewi }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

He became famous for playing the lead role of [[San Te]] in ''[[The 36th Chamber of Shaolin]]'' (1978) and its sequels. He later became known for his two roles in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill]]'' films: Johnny Mo, the leader of the Crazy 88 [[Yakuza]] gang in ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1|Volume 1]]'' (2003); and [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] [[Sifu|master]] [[Bak Mei|Pai Mei]] in ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 2|Volume 2]]'' (2004).\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born Sin Kam-hei in [[Guangdong]] Province, [[China]] in August 22, 1955,<ref>[https://afspot.net/forum/topic/811806-20160829-gordon-liu-hogs-the-microphone-on-his-65th-birthday/]</ref> prior to his adoption into another family.<ref>[http://www.spcnet.tv/Gordon-Lau-Ka-Fai-ac3086.html Gordon Lau Ka-fai \u5289\u5bb6\u8f1d]</ref> Liu is often wrongly cited as being the adopted son of [[Lau Cham]], and adoptive brother of famed directors / actors [[Lau Kar-leung]] (Liu Chia-liang) and [[Lau Kar-wing]] (Liu Chia-Yung). In fact, he was not adopted by the Lau brothers' family, he is actually just Lau Cham's godson.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gordon Liu Chia Hui| work = Interview| publisher = Kung Fu Magazine | url=http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=488| accessdate = 2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he skipped school to train in [[Chinese martial arts]] without his parents' knowledge.  He trained at Lau Cham's martial arts school of [[Hung Gar]] discipline, which descended from [[Wong Fei-hung]]'s grand student (father to [[Lau Kar Leung]]). Lau Cham's wife assisted in his training and due to the friendship and respect he felt for his sifu (master/teacher) and his wife, he took on the name Lau Ka-fai. As he grew up, he found a job as a shipping clerk to make ends meet.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 54 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born mothers or fathers. There were violent confrontations between the Catholic and the Protestant (\"Orange\") Irish especially in the 1840s.<ref>Scott W.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sjport.com|title= Port of Saint John}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union strike===\nThe 1949 Canadian Seamen's Union (CSU) strike for many shows a striking bit of history in Canadian labour and is a story about anti-union shipping companies who had a clear disregard for the law. The companies demanded the removal from the contract of the hiring hall. This concession was totally unacceptable to the union as it would mean the end of the CSU. When the union discovered the shipping companies were signing back-door agreements with the Seafarer's International Union (SIU) they had implemented strike action. With SIU crews operating the ships and the longshoremen handling the cargo, the CSU strike in Saint John was, for all intents and purposes, over. The union had been destroyed by a corrupt American union, led by gangster Hal Banks, who was supported by the American labour movement, the Canadian government and the Shipping Federation of Canada. The strike was now ineffective in Saint John, but the vibrations from the strike would be felt in the city for many years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union Strike The Saint John Story|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/the-1949-canadian-seamen-s-union-strike/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive.

Route 1 extends west to [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], and northeast towards [[Moncton, New Brunswick|Moncton]]. A second major highway, [[New Brunswick Route 7|Route 7]], connects Saint John with [[Fredericton]]. There are two main road crossings over the Saint John River: the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Reversing Falls Bridge]], approximately {{convert|1|nmi|km|lk=in}} upstream.\n\nThe [[Reversing Falls Railway Bridge]] carries rail traffic for the [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]] on the route from Saint John to [[Maine]]. Saint John was serviced by the [[Atlantic (train)|\"Atlantic\" Line]] of [[Via Rail]] passenger service. Passenger rail service in Saint John was discontinued in December 1994, although the [[Canadian National Railway]] and New Brunswick Southern Railway continue to provide freight service.\n\n[[Bay Ferries]] operates a ferry service, {{MV|Fundy Rose}}, across the Bay of Fundy to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]]. The [[Summerville to Millidgeville Ferry]], a free propeller (as opposed to cable) ferry service operated by the [[New Brunswick Department of Transportation]], connects the [[Millidgeville, New Brunswick|Millidgeville]] neighbourhood with Summerville, New Brunswick, across the [[Kennebecasis River]] on the [[Kingston Peninsula]].\n\nBus service is provided by [[Saint John Transit]] (Greater Saint John Area) and [[Maritime Bus]] (Inter-city). [[Acadian Lines]] used to operate regular inter-city bus services between New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Bangor, as well as [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]], [[Quebec]] (connecting with [[Orl\u00e9ans Express]]). In November 2012, Acadian Lines ceased operations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe presence of Irish, British and French heritage is very apparent along with maritime traditions. Saint John's economy has long ties to the fisheries and shipbuilding, and is known for the ''Marco Polo'' as its flagship vessel. However, the city's economy has begun a transition from resource-based sectors and manufacturing to include growing IT and research sectors. The city has always been a traditional hub for the arts on the east coast, boasting many notable artists, actors and musicians, including [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and [[Miller Brittain]].\n\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet [[Clara Kathleen Smith| Kay Smith]], painters [[Jack Humphrey]], Miller Brittain, [[Bruno Bobak]], Fred Ross, and sculptor [[John Hooper (sculptor)|John Hooper]] and folk-singer Tom Connors. Poet Bliss Carman once wrote about Saint John, \"All the beauty and mystery Of life were there, adventure bold, Youth, and the glamour of the sea, And all its sorrows old.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Saint John: City of Firsts |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1950/6/15/saint-john-city-of-firsts |publisher=Maclean's}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Saint John, NB, historical Church (Brennans) St..jpg|thumb|Saint John is known for its pub and restaurant scene throughout uptown.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]]. Some musicians from Saint John include Berkley Chadwick, [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Ken Tobias]], Stevedore Steve,<ref>{{cite news|title=Stevedore Steve, writer of Lester the Lobster, dead at 80|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/stevedore-steve-obit-1.3806926|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Jane Coop, Bruce Holder, Frances James, the songwriter Michael F.

Prior to 1950 it was known as Moosepath Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|The Commons at the University of New Brunswick]]\nIn 1964, the [[University of New Brunswick]] created UNB Saint John in buildings throughout the uptown CBD. In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]].

Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 54 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born mothers or fathers. There were violent confrontations between the Catholic and the Protestant (\"Orange\") Irish especially in the 1840s.<ref>Scott W.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sjport.com|title= Port of Saint John}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union strike===\nThe 1949 Canadian Seamen's Union (CSU) strike for many shows a striking bit of history in Canadian labour and is a story about anti-union shipping companies who had a clear disregard for the law. The companies demanded the removal from the contract of the hiring hall. This concession was totally unacceptable to the union as it would mean the end of the CSU. When the union discovered the shipping companies were signing back-door agreements with the Seafarer's International Union (SIU) they had implemented strike action. With SIU crews operating the ships and the longshoremen handling the cargo, the CSU strike in Saint John was, for all intents and purposes, over. The union had been destroyed by a corrupt American union, led by gangster Hal Banks, who was supported by the American labour movement, the Canadian government and the Shipping Federation of Canada. The strike was now ineffective in Saint John, but the vibrations from the strike would be felt in the city for many years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union Strike The Saint John Story|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/the-1949-canadian-seamen-s-union-strike/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive.

Route 1 extends west to [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], and northeast towards [[Moncton, New Brunswick|Moncton]]. A second major highway, [[New Brunswick Route 7|Route 7]], connects Saint John with [[Fredericton]]. There are two main road crossings over the Saint John River: the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Reversing Falls Bridge]], approximately {{convert|1|nmi|km|lk=in}} upstream.\n\nThe [[Reversing Falls Railway Bridge]] carries rail traffic for the [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]] on the route from Saint John to [[Maine]]. Saint John was serviced by the [[Atlantic (train)|\"Atlantic\" Line]] of [[Via Rail]] passenger service. Passenger rail service in Saint John was discontinued in December 1994, although the [[Canadian National Railway]] and New Brunswick Southern Railway continue to provide freight service.\n\n[[Bay Ferries]] operates a ferry service, {{MV|Fundy Rose}}, across the Bay of Fundy to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]].

In November 2012, Acadian Lines ceased operations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe presence of Irish, British and French heritage is very apparent along with maritime traditions. Saint John's economy has long ties to the fisheries and shipbuilding, and is known for the ''Marco Polo'' as its flagship vessel. However, the city's economy has begun a transition from resource-based sectors and manufacturing to include growing IT and research sectors. The city has always been a traditional hub for the arts on the east coast, boasting many notable artists, actors and musicians, including [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and [[Miller Brittain]].\n\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet [[Clara Kathleen Smith| Kay Smith]], painters [[Jack Humphrey]], Miller Brittain, [[Bruno Bobak]], Fred Ross, and sculptor [[John Hooper (sculptor)|John Hooper]] and folk-singer Tom Connors. Poet Bliss Carman once wrote about Saint John, \"All the beauty and mystery Of life were there, adventure bold, Youth, and the glamour of the sea, And all its sorrows old.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Saint John: City of Firsts |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1950/6/15/saint-john-city-of-firsts |publisher=Maclean's}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Saint John, NB, historical Church (Brennans) St..jpg|thumb|Saint John is known for its pub and restaurant scene throughout uptown.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]]. Some musicians from Saint John include Berkley Chadwick, [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Ken Tobias]], Stevedore Steve,<ref>{{cite news|title=Stevedore Steve, writer of Lester the Lobster, dead at 80|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/stevedore-steve-obit-1.3806926|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Jane Coop, Bruce Holder, Frances James, the songwriter Michael F.

Prior to 1950 it was known as Moosepath Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|The Commons at the University of New Brunswick]]\nIn 1964, the [[University of New Brunswick]] created UNB Saint John in buildings throughout the uptown CBD. In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.
