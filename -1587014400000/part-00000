It also debuted in the same year in [[Germany]] on [[ProSieben]] (and Later on [[KIKA]] and [[Junior (TV channel)|Junior]]), and aired in [[Quebec]] on [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]]. In the UK, the first season premiered on [[Channel 4]] in 1998 under the show's original title of ''Home to Rent'' in the [[United Kingdom]] and the second season premiered under the series' final name on [[Nicktoons UK]] on November 5, 2005 at 9:30am. Furthermore, it aired as part of the [[Fox Kids]] lineup on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the [[United States]].\n\nThe series also served as the basis of an [[adventure game]], developed by Xilam themselves and published by [[Ubi Soft Entertainment]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Sega Dreamcast]], and [[Mac OS]] called ''[[Stupid Invaders]]'' in 2000, which was dedicated to its creator, [[Jean-Yves Raimbaud]] (1958\u20131998). It featured the voice actors of its English dub as the five aliens, along with [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Laraine Newman]] as various other characters, and was more adult than the series, so it was rated \"T\" by the [[ESRB]] and \"11+\" by the [[ELSPA]].\n\n==Plot==\nFive [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s from the fictitious planet Zigma B, Candy H. Caramella, Etno Polino, Stereo Monovici, Bud Budiovitch and Gorgious Klatoo go on a picnic together in space. However, their spaceship crashes into an asteroid, and they fall to planet Earth. They realize that if any human finds out that they are aliens, they could be captured and experimented on by scientists, so they take shelter in the attic of a house that is up for rent. The aliens have two goals: return to their home planet, and chase away anybody who tries to establish themselves in the house. To remain unknown from humans, the aliens use a device called the SMTV that lets them transform into almost any entity of their choosing, but always cycles through three other transformations when used.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Candy Hector Caramella''': Small and green with a wrinkled forehead and wearing a polka-dotted apron, Candy is the uptight neat freak of the group. He is homosexual, and it is not uncommon to see him flirt with men. In the Latin American Spanish dub that was aired on [[Jetix]] and [[Magic Kids]], Candy's sex was changed to female (despite his middle name). In both the original French dub and the English dub, Candy's voice parodies a fancy [[English accent]], and was done by [[Eric Le Roch]] in Season 1 of the French dub, [[\u00c9ric M\u00e9tayer]] in Season 2 of the French dub, and [[Charlie Adler]] in the English dub.\n*'''Etno Polino''': Being short and purple with red lips and a big nose, Etno is the leader and brains of the group. A scientific genius, he creates all sorts of machines with the intention of aiding the group's return to their own planet, including rockets. The aliens often fail to blast off into space, either due to Etno's rockets malfunctioning or someone else boarding the ships. In the original French dub, he speaks with an English accent, but in the English dub, he has a rather fast-paced scientist speech, vaguely reminiscent of those found in educational films about space exploration from the 1950s. Etno's voice was provided by [[Peter Hudson]] in Season 1 of the French dub, [[Bernard Alane]] in Season 2 of the French dub, and [[Maurice LaMarche]] for the English dub.\n*'''Stereo Monovici''': Two-headed and red in which each head has a slightly long nose, Stereo acts as two people since each head has its own mind. They are the \"bookworm\" of the group yet often waste their intelligence on the most useless information. Both heads often argue with each other. Stereo was removed from the series for Season 2, but reappeared in two segments of that season (\"Other World Champs\" and \"UFO\"). Both heads are voiced by [[Antoine Tom\u00e9]] in Season 1 of the French dub, [[Patrick Guillemin]] in Season 2 of the French dub, and [[Jeff Bennett]] in Season 1 of the English dub (but for Season 2 of the English dub, they are voiced by Charlie Adler and [[Danny Mann]] respectively). One of the heads also speaks with a distinct high-pitched tone, while the other head speaks with a rather low-pitched one.\n*'''Bud Budiovitch''': Tall and orange with three strands of hair, a long neck, and big pink bloodshot eyes, Bud is lazy and naive. He is a television addict and spends most of the time sitting in front of it and drinking soft drinks. Like Etno, Bud is always the last one to panic in a situation. He always comes up with the best solution, but most of the time no one will listen to him. Bud's voice was provided by [[Marc Bretonni\u00e8re]] in the French dub, Jeff Bennett in Season 1 of the English dub, and [[Louis Garneau (voice actor)|Louis Garneau]] in Season 2 of the English dub.\n*'''Gorgious Klatoo''': Fat and blue with a heavy chin and a protruding bottom tooth, Gorgious is the grumpy and brutal one of the group. He is very greedy and his hobbies consist of bullying the other aliens and eating. Gorgious' voice was done by [[Patrick Pr\u00e9jean]] in the French dub, [[Michael Sicoly]] in early episodes of the English dub, and Danny Mann in all subsequent episodes of the English dub.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series overview===\n{{Series overview\n| color1           = #FFA500\n| link1            = #Season 1 (1997\u201398)\n| episodes1        = 52\n| start1           = {{start date|1997|9|6}}\n| end1             = {{end date|1998|8|29}}\n\n| color2           = #7B26CA\n| link2            = #Season 2 (2005\u201306)\n| episodes2        = 52\n| start2           = {{start date|2005|5|20}}\n| end2             = {{end date|2006|5|12}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (1997\u20131998)===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:95%; background:white\"\n! style=\"background:#FFA500; width:20px\"| No. in<br>series\n! style=\"background:#FFA500; width:20px\"| No. in<br>season\n! style=\"background:#FFA500\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFA500\"| Story by\n! style=\"background:#FFA500\"| Storyboard by\n! style=\"background:#FFA500; width:135px\"| Original air date\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1, 2\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 1, 2\n| Title = Once Upon a Time...\n| WrittenBy = Jim G\u00f3mez, Nicolas Gallet, and [[Bob Camp]]\n| Aux2 = Fran\u00e7ois Reczulski <br/> Nick C.

The characters also made a cameo in the ''[[Oggy and the Cockroaches]]'' episode \"Night Watchmen\" (the eponymous main characters for that series also made their first appearance in this one's third episode, \"Venus Junior\", when the aliens were watching their television), and in the ''[[Les Dalton (TV series)|Les Dalton]]'' episode \"Le Secret Passage\", when Candy was one of Joe's transformations in Fort Dalton.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.leszinzinsdelespace.com/ Official website]\n*[http://www.stupid-invaders.com/ Stupid Invaders official website]\n*{{IMDb title|118343}}\n*[http://www.tv.com/space-goofs/show/22356/summary.html Space Goofs at TV.com]\n*{{moby game|id=/stupid-invaders|name=''Stupid Invaders''}}\n\n{{Xilam}}\n{{Fox Kids}}\n\n[[Category:1990s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:1997 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2006 French television series endings]]\n[[Category:1997 German television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2006 German television series endings]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:German animated television series]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional extraterrestrial characters]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Television series about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Fox Kids original programming]]\n[[Category:Jetix original programming]]\n[[Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:Xilam]]\n[[Category:YTV shows]]\n[[Category:ProSieben television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Saban Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Channel 4 television programmes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{expand Portuguese|topic=|otherarticle=Les Zinzins de l'espace|date=September 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2014}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Space Goofs <br><small>Les Zinzins de l'Espace</small>\n| image                    = Space Goofs.jpg\n| caption                  = The opening sequence from the first season.\n| show_name_2              = Home to Rent\n| genre                    = [[Animated television series]]\n| creator                  = [[Jean-Yves Raimbaud]]<br>[[Philippe Traversat]]\n| developer                = [[Isabelle de Catalogne]]<br>[[Samuel Kaminka]]\n| director                 = [[Thomas Szab\u00f3]] (Season 1)<br>[[Olivier Jean-Marie]] (Season 2)\n| voices                   = [[Charlie Adler]] (Candy, Stereo in Season 2)<br>[[Jeff Bennett]] (Bud and Stereo in Season 1)<br>[[Maurice LaMarche]] (Etno)<br>[[Michael Sicoly]] (Gorgious in early episodes of Season 1)<br>[[Danny Mann]] (Gorgious, Stereo in Season 2)<br>[[Louis Garneau (voice actor)|Louis Garneau]] (Bud in Season 2) <br>[[Carlos Alazraqui]] (uncredited)<br>[[Jim Cummings]] (uncredited)<br>[[Jessica DiCicco]] (uncredited)<br>[[Tom Kenny]] (uncredited)<br>[[Kevin Michael Richardson]] (uncredited)<br>[[Kath Soucie]] (uncredited)<br>[[Billy West]] (uncredited)\n| country                  = [[France]]\n| channel                  = [[France 3]]\n| num_seasons              = 2\n| num_episodes             = 104\n| executive_producer       = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| producer                 = Marc du Pontavice\n| editor                   = [[Daniel Reynes]] (Season 1)<br>[[Florence Poli]] (Season 1)<br>[[Patrick Ducruet]] (Season 2)\n| composer                 = [[Herv\u00e9 Lavandier]]<br>[[Ramon Pipin]]\n| opentheme                = \"Monster Men\" by [[Iggy Pop]]\n| list_episodes            = #Episodes\n| language                 = [[French language|French]]<br>[[English language|English]]\n| runtime                  = 11 minutes (segments)<br>22 minutes (series)\n| company                  = [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont Multimedia]] (Season 1)<br>[[Xilam Animation]] (Season 2)\n| distributor              = [[Saban International]] (season 1)<br>Xilam Animation (Season 2)\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|1997|9|06}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|2006|5|12}}\n}}\n\n'''''Space Goofs''''' ([[French language|French]] title: ''Les Zinzins de l'Espace'') is a [[France|French]] [[Animated television series|animated series]] that was produced by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont Multimedia]] for its first season, and [[Xilam Animation]] for its second season, for [[France 3]] and broadcast on that network from September 6, 1997 to May 12, 2006. It also debuted in the same year in [[Germany]] on [[ProSieben]], and aired in [[Quebec]] on [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]]. In the UK, the first season premiered on [[Channel 4]] in 1998 under the show's original title of ''Home to Rent'' in the [[United Kingdom]] and the second season premiered under the series' final name on [[Nicktoons UK]] on November 5, 2005 at 9:30am. Furthermore, it aired as part of the [[Fox Kids]] lineup on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the [[United States]].\n\nThe series also served as the basis of an [[adventure game]], developed by Xilam themselves and published by [[Ubi Soft Entertainment]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Sega Dreamcast]], and [[Mac OS]] called ''Stupid Invaders'' in 2000, which was dedicated to its creator, [[Jean-Yves Raimbaud]] (1958\u20131998). It featured the voice actors of its English dub as the five aliens, along with [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Laraine Newman]] as various other characters, and was more adult than the series, so it was rated \"T\" by the [[ESRB]] and \"11+\" by the [[ELSPA]].\n\n==Plot==\nFive [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s from the fictitious planet Zigma B, Candy H. Caramella, Etno Polino, Stereo Monovici, Bud Budiovitch and Gorgious Klatoo go on a picnic together in space. However, their spaceship crashes into an asteroid, and they fall to planet Earth. They realize that if any human finds out that they are aliens, they could be captured and experimented on by scientists, so they take shelter in the attic of a house that is up for rent. The aliens have two goals: return to their home planet, and chase away anybody who tries to establish themselves in the house. To remain unknown from humans, the aliens use a device called the SMTV that lets them transform into almost any entity of their choosing, but always cycles through three other transformations when used.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Candy Hector Caramella''': Small and green with a wrinkled forehead and wearing a polka-dotted apron, Candy is the uptight neat freak of the group. He is homosexual, and it is not uncommon to see him flirt with men. In the Latin American Spanish dub that was aired on [[Jetix]] and [[Magic Kids]], Candy's sex was changed to female (despite his middle name). In both the original French dub and the English dub, Candy's voice parodies a fancy [[English accent]], and was done by [[Eric Le Roch]] in Season 1 of the French dub, [[\u00c9ric M\u00e9tayer]] in Season 2 of the French dub, and [[Charlie Adler]] in the English dub.\n*'''Etno Polino''': Being short and purple with red lips and a big nose, Etno is the leader and brains of the group. A scientific genius, he creates all sorts of machines with the intention of aiding the group's return to their own planet, including rockets. The aliens often fail to blast off into space, either due to Etno's rockets malfunctioning or someone else boarding the ships. In the original French dub, he speaks with an English accent, but in the English dub, he has a rather fast-paced scientist speech, vaguely reminiscent of those found in educational films about space exploration from the 1950s. Etno's voice was provided by [[Peter Hudson]] in Season 1 of the French dub, [[Bernard Alane]] in Season 2 of the French dub, and [[Maurice LaMarche]] for the English dub.\n*'''Stereo Monovici''': Two-headed and red in which each head has a slightly long nose, Stereo acts as two people since each head has its own mind. They are the \"bookworm\" of the group yet often waste their intelligence on the most useless information. Both heads often argue with each other. Stereo was removed from the series for Season 2, but reappeared in two segments of that season (\"Other World Champs\" and \"UFO\"). Both heads are voiced by [[Antoine Tom\u00e9]] in Season 1 of the French dub, [[Patrick Guillemin]] in Season 2 of the French dub, and [[Jeff Bennett]] in Season 1 of the English dub (but for Season 2 of the English dub, they are voiced by Charlie Adler and [[Danny Mann]] respectively). One of the heads also speaks with a distinct high-pitched tone, while the other head speaks with a rather low-pitched one.\n*'''Bud Budiovitch''': Tall and orange with three strands of hair, a long neck, and big pink bloodshot eyes, Bud is lazy and naive. He is a television addict and spends most of the time sitting in front of it and drinking soft drinks. Like Etno, Bud is always the last one to panic in a situation. He always comes up with the best solution, but most of the time no one will listen to him. Bud's voice was provided by [[Marc Bretonni\u00e8re]] in the French dub, Jeff Bennett in Season 1 of the English dub, and [[Louis Garneau (voice actor)|Louis Garneau]] in Season 2 of the English dub.\n*'''Gorgious Klatoo''': Fat and blue with a heavy chin and a protruding bottom tooth, Gorgious is the grumpy and brutal one of the group. He is very greedy and his hobbies consist of bullying the other aliens and eating. Gorgious' voice was done by [[Patrick Pr\u00e9jean]] in the French dub, [[Michael Sicoly]] in early episodes of the English dub, and Danny Mann in all subsequent episodes of the English dub.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series overview===\n{{Series overview\n| color1           = #FFA500\n| link1            = #Season 1 (1997\u201398)\n| episodes1        = 52\n| start1           = {{start date|1997|9|6}}\n| end1             = {{end date|1998|8|29}}\n\n| color2           = #7B26CA\n| link2            = #Season 2 (2005\u201306)\n| episodes2        = 52\n| start2           = {{start date|2005|5|20}}\n| end2             = {{end date|2006|5|12}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (1997\u20131998)===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:95%; background:white\"\n! style=\"background:#FFA500; width:20px\"| No. in<br>series\n! style=\"background:#FFA500; width:20px\"| No. in<br>season\n! style=\"background:#FFA500\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFA500\"| Story by\n! style=\"background:#FFA500\"| Storyboard by\n! style=\"background:#FFA500; width:135px\"| Original air date\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1, 2\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 1, 2\n| Title = Once Upon a Time...\n| WrittenBy = Jim G\u00f3mez, Nicolas Gallet, and [[Bob Camp]]\n| Aux2 = Fran\u00e7ois Reczulski <br/> Nick C.

His writing was critical of Finland's status at the time as a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] under the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian Tsar]]s. Its sharpness cost him his job as a [[lecturer]] at [[The Royal Academy of Turku]] and he had to emigrate to Sweden, where he continued his political activity. The Finnish national movement considered Arwidsson the mastermind of an independent Finland.\n\n== Life ==\nAdolf Ivar Arwidsson was born in 1791 in [[Padasjoki]] in southern Finland. His father, a [[chaplain]], later moved the family to [[Laukaa]] in mid-Finland. Laukaa was severely affected by the [[Finnish war]] of 1808\u20131809, and Arwidsson was left facing life under the [[Russian Empire]], to which Finland now an belonged as an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]].

Enabling support from the Swedish speaking upper strata of the Finnish society for a separate Finnish identity was expressed by the University docent A. I. Arwidsson (1791\u20131858) in a phrase that, somewhat modified, became an often quoted Fennoman credo: \"Swedes we are not, Russians we do not want to become, let us therefore be Finns.\" (Swedish form: \"Svenskar \u00e4ro vi icke, ryssar vilja vi icke bli, l\u00e5t oss allts\u00e5 vara finnar\" Finnish form: \"Ruotsalaisia emme ole, ven\u00e4l\u00e4isiksi emme tahdo tulla, olkaamme siis suomalaisia.\")\nIn 1814 [[the Royal Academy of Turku]] awarded him his [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]] in [[philosophy]]. In 1817 the same institution awarded him his [[doctorate]], and he became a [[lecturer]] at the academy. Arwidsson's native language was [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; all his works are in Swedish, though he was a fluent speaker of [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nAfter his dissertation Arwidsson spent a year in [[Sweden]]. During this time he made contact with the exiled Finns in [[Uppsala]] and [[Stockholm]].  In 1820 after his return Arwidsson, who had so far written [[lyric poetry]], submitted for publication a political text whose sharp and radical tone soon ensured attention in the capital, [[Saint Petersburg]].  Finally, as a consequence, in 1822 he lost his position as a lecturer and was banished from the university.  Cut off from his training in his chosen career, in 1823 Arwidsson emigrated to [[Stockholm]], where in 1825 he gained his civil rights, and found work as a [[librarian]] in the royal library.\n\nIn 1827 Arwidsson undertook a research trip to Finland, but was immediately deported back to Sweden by the authorities. This experience led to a further radicalisation of his political work, and as a result he participated in several public debates in Sweden, in each of which he represented the situation in Finland in a dark light, but at the same time tried to portray the Finnish-national identity positively. Apart from his political work, Arwidsson also produced several historical research works. In 1843 he was appointed director of the royal library. In the same year he was allowed to travel to Finland, but he only took advantage of this possibility in 1858, when he undertook a round trip through Finland. During this journey Arwidsson caught pneumonia, and died on 21 June in [[Viipuri]]. He was buried in his childhood home town of [[Laukaa]].

His writing was critical of Finland's status at the time as a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] under the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian Tsar]]s. Its sharpness cost him his job as a [[lecturer]] at [[The Royal Academy of Turku]] and he had to emigrate to Sweden, where he continued his political activity. The Finnish national movement considered Arwidsson the mastermind of an independent Finland.\n\n== Life ==\nAdolf Ivar Arwidsson was born in 1791 in [[Padasjoki]] in southern Finland. His father, a [[chaplain]], later moved the family to [[Laukaa]] in mid-Finland. Laukaa was severely affected by the [[Finnish war]] of 1808-1809, and Arwidsson was left facing life under the [[Russian Empire]], to which Finland now an belonged as an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]]. In 1809, while still at high school in [[Porvoo]], Arwidsson was a representative<ref name=translate>I'm not sure I've translated this right.</ref> at the [[Diet of Porvoo]], at which the Finnish [[Estates of the realm|estates]] swore [[Oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] to the Tsars.

At first the crew was to be Commander [[Sergei Zalyotin]] and Flight Engineer [[Frank De Winne]]; however, a report released on February 2002 stated that American musician [[Lance Bass]] was interested in joining the crew for a one-week mission on board the Russian spacecraft. The mission began to fall through, and by September 2002 they had discontinued the training of Lance Bass due to the mission organizers' failure to meet the terms of the contract. They filled the vacant seat left by Lance Bass with Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Lonchakov]].\n\nWhile the Soyuz TMA-1 was on orbit, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia shuttle accident]] occurred and required a change in crew changeout process.  The Soyuz system would become the sole method for crew to launch to and return from ISS, until the space shuttle was [[STS-114|returned to service in July 2005]].\n\nSoyuz TMA-1 disembarked from ISS on May 4, 2003 and immediately began its return to Earth, marking the first entry and descent for this Soyuz class.  A technical malfunction caused the Soyuz control system to abandon the gentler controlled entry and descent and instead fall back to the harsher ballistic reentry and descent.  This resulted in a steep and off target landing of the spacecraft.  The craft landed 300 miles short of the planned area, and the crew was subjected to severe gravitational loads.  Communication with the Soyuz was lost because one antenna was ripped off during descent, and two more did not deploy.  The crew regained communications through an emergency transmitter after landing.  Due to this event, future crews would be provided with a satellite phone to establish contact with recovery forces.\n\nSubsequent Soyuz TMA missions were able to successfully execute controlled reentries, until the [[Soyuz TMA-10]] and [[Soyuz TMA-11]] missions which both also reverted to ballistic descents.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition21/exp21_land.html NASA.gov: Expedition 21 and Soyuz TMA-1]\n\n{{Soyuz}}\n{{Manned ISS flight}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2002}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Soyuz TMA-01}}\n[[Category:Crewed Soyuz missions]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2002]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2003]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-FG rockets]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a real 2002 spaceflight|the fictional Tycho Magnetic Anomaly TMA-1|Monolith (Space Odyssey)}}\n{{Infobox spaceflight\n| name = Soyuz TMA-1\n| image = Soyuz TMA-1.jpg\n| image_caption = TMA-1 approaches the ISS\n| insignia = Soyouz TMA-1 logo.svg\n| mission_type = [[ISS]] crew transport\n| operator = [[Rosaviakosmos]]\n| COSPAR_ID = 2002-050A\n| SATCAT = 27552\n| mission_duration = 185&nbsp;days, 22&nbsp;hours, 53&nbsp;minutes, 14&nbsp;seconds\n| distance_travelled = \n| orbits_completed = ~3,020\n| spacecraft = Soyuz 11F732 No.211<ref name=\"launchlog\">{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref>\n| spacecraft_type = [[Soyuz-TMA]] 11F732\n| manufacturer = [[RKK Energia]]\n| launch_mass = {{convert| | | |abbr=on}}\n| landing_mass = {{convert| | | |abbr=on}}\n| launch_date = {{start-date|October 30, 2002, 03:11:11|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC\n| launch_rocket = [[Soyuz-FG]]\n| launch_site = [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 1|1/5]]\n| landing_date = {{end-date|May 4, 2003, 02:04:25|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC\n| landing_site = 49.39\u00b0 N; 61.2\u00b0 E\n| crew_size = 3\n| crew_launching = [[Sergei Zalyotin]]<br/>[[Frank De Winne]]<br/>[[Yury Lonchakov]]\n| crew_landing = [[Nikolai Budarin]]<br/>[[Kenneth Bowersox]]<br/>[[Donald Pettit]]\n| crew_callsign = ''Yenisey''\n| crew_photo = Soyuz TMA-1 crew.jpg\n| crew_photo_caption = From left to right: Frank de Winne, Sergei Zalyotin and Yuri Lonchakov\n| orbit_epoch = 6 November 2002<ref name=\"satcat\">{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref>\n| orbit_reference = [[Geocentric orbit|Geocentric]]\n| orbit_regime = [[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth]]\n| orbit_periapsis = {{convert|383|km|mi}}\n| orbit_apoapsis = {{convert|402|km|mi}}\n| orbit_inclination = 51.6&nbsp;degrees\n| orbit_period = 92.4&nbsp;minutes\n| apsis = gee\n| docking = {{Infobox spaceflight/Dock\n   | docking_target     = [[International Space Station|ISS]]\n   | docking_type       = dock\n   | docking_port       = ''[[Pirs (ISS module)|Pirs]]'' nadir\n   | docking_date       = 1 November 2002<br/>05:01&nbsp;UTC\n   | undocking_date     = 3 May 2003<br/>22:43&nbsp;UTC\n   | time_docked        = {{time interval|1 November 2002 05:01|3 May 2003 22:43|show=dhm|abbr=on}}\n }}\n| previous_mission = [[Soyuz TM-34]]\n| next_mission = [[Soyuz TMA-2]]\n| programme = [[Soyuz programme]]<br/><small>(Crewed missions)</small>\n}}'''Soyuz TMA-1'''{{efn|'''T''' \u2013 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u2013 ''Transportnyi'' \u2013 meaning transport, <br/>'''M''' \u2013 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u2013 ''Modifitsirovannyi'' \u2013 meaning modified, <br/>'''A''' \u2013 \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u2013 ''Antropometricheskii'' meaning [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]]).}}, also catalogued as '''Soyuz TM-35''', was a [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] mission to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) launched by a [[Soyuz FG]] launch vehicle with a Russian-Belgian cosmonaut crew blasted off from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]].<ref>[http://quest.nasa.gov/news/space/2002/10-29a.txt Quest.NASA.gov Space report No.46] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917084334/http://quest.nasa.gov/news/space/2002/10-29a.txt |date=2008-09-17 }}</ref> This was the fifth Russian Soyuz spacecraft to fly to the [[International Space Station]].

In 1853, Colonel [[William Duckett Bowie]] obtained a charter from the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland legislature]] to construct a rail line into Southern Maryland. In 1869, the [[Baltimore & Potomac Railroad|Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Company]] began the construction of a railroad from Baltimore to Southern Maryland, terminating in [[Popes Creek, Maryland|Pope's Creek]]. The area had already been dotted with small farms and large tobacco plantations in an economy based on agriculture and slavery. In 1870, Ben Plumb, a land speculator and developer, sold building lots around the railroad junction and named the settlement Huntington City. By 1872, the line was completed, together with a \"spur\" to Washington, D.C. and the entire line through Southern Maryland was completed in 1873.\n\nIn 1880, Huntington City was rechartered as Bowie, named for Colonel Bowie's son and business partner [[Oden Bowie]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|title=Revitalization of Old Town Bowie\n|publisher=City of Bowie, Maryland\n|accessdate=2007-10-02\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720142757/http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|archivedate=2007-07-20\n}}</ref><ref name=hall>\n{{cite web\n  | title =The Prince George's Hall of Fame\n  | publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n  | year =2003\n  | url =http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | accessdate =2007-08-16\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070924204547/http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | archivedate =2007-09-24\n  }}\n</ref><ref name=pg300>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pghistory.org/PG/PG300/obowie.html\n|title=Prince George's County: Over 300 years of History&nbsp;\u2013 Oden Bowie\n| publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n|year=1996\n|accessdate= 2007-10-02}}</ref><ref name=penn>\n{{cite book\n  | last =Wilson\n  | first =William Bender\n  | title =History of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company: With Plan of Organization\n  | url =https://archive.org/details/historypennsylv03wilsgoog\n  | publisher =Henry T.

A second railroad entered the community when the [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway]] electric trolley line commenced service in 1908. The large interurban cars brought rapid transit to the area, with trains running hourly. Bowie area stations included High Bridge, Hillmeade, and the Race Track.\n\nThe convergence of the two rail systems induced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Society to build the [[Bowie Race Track]] in 1914. The track enabled the [[Belair Stud]] to become one of Maryland's premier areas for [[thoroughbreds]]. Also in 1914, a teacher-training college, or [[normal school]] as it was referred to then, was built for African-Americans, just outside the town. This now has become [[Bowie State University]].  The town of Bowie was incorporated in 1916.\n\n====Belair at Bowie====\nIn 1957, the firm of [[William Levitt|Levitt and Sons]] acquired the nearby Belair Estate, the original colonial plantation of the [[Province of Maryland|Provincial Governor of Maryland]], [[Samuel Ogle]], and developed the residential community of Belair at Bowie. Two years later the town of Bowie annexed the Levitt properties, and then re-incorporated the now-larger area as a city in 1963. The overwhelming majority of Bowie residents today live in this 1960s Levitt planned community, whose street names are arranged in alliterative sections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=James A. |title=Belair at Bowie |url=http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |website=[[Society of Architectural Historians]] Archipedia |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |accessdate=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072201/http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |archive-date=29 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Levitt & Sons had a long history of prohibiting the sale of houses (including resale by owners) to African Americans which led to protests during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in Bowie in 1963.<ref name = \"Time200\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989781-1,00.html Suburban Legend WILLIAM LEVITT]</ref>\n\n====Belair Estate====\nThe original Belair Estate contains the [[Belair Mansion (Bowie, Maryland)|Belair Mansion]] (circa 1745), the five-part Georgian plantation house of Governor [[Samuel Ogle]] and his son Governor [[Benjamin Ogle]]. It was purchased in 1898 by the wealthy banker [[James T. Woodward]] who, on his passing in 1910, left it to his nephew, [[William Woodward, Sr.]], who became a famous horseman. Restored to reflect its 250-year-old legacy, the Mansion is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n[[Belair Stable Museum|Belair Stable]], on the Estate, was part of the famous [[Belair Stud]], one of the premier [[Thoroughbred horse racing|racing stables]] in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s.

In 1853, Colonel [[William Duckett Bowie]] obtained a charter from the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland legislature]] to construct a rail line into Southern Maryland. In 1869, the [[Baltimore & Potomac Railroad|Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Company]] began the construction of a railroad from Baltimore to Southern Maryland, terminating in [[Popes Creek, Maryland|Pope's Creek]]. The area had already been dotted with small farms and large tobacco plantations in an economy based on agriculture and slavery. In 1870, Ben Plumb, a land speculator and developer, sold building lots around the railroad junction and named the settlement Huntington City. By 1872, the line was completed, together with a \"spur\" to Washington, D.C. and the entire line through Southern Maryland was completed in 1873.\n\nIn 1880, Huntington City was rechartered as Bowie, named for Colonel Bowie's son and business partner [[Oden Bowie]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|title=Revitalization of Old Town Bowie\n|publisher=City of Bowie, Maryland\n|accessdate=2007-10-02\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720142757/http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|archivedate=2007-07-20\n}}</ref><ref name=hall>\n{{cite web\n  | title =The Prince George's Hall of Fame\n  | publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n  | year =2003\n  | url =http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | accessdate =2007-08-16\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070924204547/http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | archivedate =2007-09-24\n  }}\n</ref><ref name=pg300>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pghistory.org/PG/PG300/obowie.html\n|title=Prince George's County: Over 300 years of History&nbsp;\u2013 Oden Bowie\n| publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n|year=1996\n|accessdate= 2007-10-02}}</ref><ref name=penn>\n{{cite book\n  | last =Wilson\n  | first =William Bender\n  | title =History of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company: With Plan of Organization\n  | url =https://archive.org/details/historypennsylv03wilsgoog\n  | publisher =Henry T.

The large interurban cars brought rapid transit to the area, with trains running hourly. Bowie area stations included High Bridge, Hillmeade, and the Race Track.\n\nThe convergence of the two rail systems induced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Society to build the [[Bowie Race Track]] in 1914. The track enabled the [[Belair Stud]] to become one of Maryland's premier areas for [[thoroughbreds]]. Also in 1914, a teacher-training college, or [[normal school]] as it was referred to then, was built for African-Americans, just outside the town. This now has become [[Bowie State University]].  The town of Bowie was incorporated in 1916.\n\n====Belair at Bowie====\nIn 1957, the firm of [[William Levitt|Levitt and Sons]] acquired the nearby Belair Estate, the original colonial plantation of the [[Province of Maryland|Provincial Governor of Maryland]], [[Samuel Ogle]], and developed the residential community of Belair at Bowie. Two years later the town of Bowie annexed the Levitt properties, and then re-incorporated the now-larger area as a city in 1963. The overwhelming majority of Bowie residents today live in this 1960s Levitt planned community, whose street names are arranged in alliterative sections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=James A. |title=Belair at Bowie |url=http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |website=[[Society of Architectural Historians]] Archipedia |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |accessdate=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072201/http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |archive-date=29 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Levitt & Sons had a long history of prohibiting the sale of houses (including resale by owners) to African Americans which led to protests during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in Bowie in 1963.<ref name = \"Time200\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989781-1,00.html Suburban Legend WILLIAM LEVITT]</ref>\n\n====Belair Estate====\nThe original Belair Estate contains the [[Belair Mansion (Bowie, Maryland)|Belair Mansion]] (circa 1745), the five-part Georgian plantation house of Governor [[Samuel Ogle]] and his son Governor [[Benjamin Ogle]]. It was purchased in 1898 by the wealthy banker [[James T. Woodward]] who, on his passing in 1910, left it to his nephew, [[William Woodward, Sr.]], who became a famous horseman. Restored to reflect its 250-year-old legacy, the Mansion is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n[[Belair Stable Museum|Belair Stable]], on the Estate, was part of the famous [[Belair Stud]], one of the premier [[Thoroughbred horse racing|racing stables]] in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Owned and operated by [[William Woodward, Sr.]] (1876\u20131953), it closed in 1957 following the death of his son, [[William Woodward, Jr.|Billy Woodward]]. Belair had been the oldest continually operating thoroughbred horse farm in the country.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===21st century===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}\nBowie has an area of {{convert|16|sqmi|km2}} and about 50,000 residents with nearly {{convert|2,000|acre|km2}} set aside as parks or open space.

In 2006, the city reopened the Bowie Building Association building, a small brick and block structure constructed circa 1930, as a Welcome Center; it originally housed the Bowie Building Association, which helped finance much of the community's early development.\n\nBowie is home to the [[Bowie Baysox]], a [[Minor league baseball|Class AA]] [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]] professional baseball team affiliated with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. The Baysox moved to Bowie from Hagerstown in 1993 and began play at Prince George's Stadium in 1994.  In 2015, the Baysox captured their first Eastern League Championship, defeating the [[Reading Fightin Phils]] in five games.\n\nThe city operates a senior citizens center and a gymnasium for community programs.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Bowie, Maryland map enlarged.png|right|thumb|300px|Detailed census map of Bowie, MD and surrounding areas.

He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N. Gregory, \"Sand Springs\", ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133246/http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 |date=2015-04-02 }}, Accessed May 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nPage bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County, Oklahoma in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H.

The leak started sometime around the morning. Between 11:15 and 12:58, five students went homesick.

Many students went to the hospital from [[Carbon Monoxide Poisoning]]. \"There was no evidence of the presence of carbon monoxide in the 6th Grade Center\". Over 50 students were sent to nearby hospitals. The school didn't have carbon monoxide detectors at the time which the district says \"it'll resolve\".

The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road.

Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company.
