According to the Quran, Muhammad is the last in a chain of prophets sent by God ({{cite quran|33|40|s=ns|b=n}}). Throughout the Quran, Muhammad is referred to as \"Messenger\", \"Messenger of God\", and \"Prophet\". Some of such verses are 2:101, 2:143, 2:151, 3:32, 3:81, 3:144, 3:164, 4:79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7:157, 8:01, 9:3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09. Other terms are used, including \"Warner\", \"bearer of glad tidings\", and the \"one who invites people to a Single God\" (Quran {{cite quran|12|108|s=ns|b=n}}, and {{cite quran|33|45-46|s=ns|b=n}}). The Quran asserts that Muhammad was a man who possessed the highest moral excellence, and that God made him a good example or a \"goodly model\" for Muslims to follow (Quran {{cite quran|68|4|s=ns|b=n}}, and {{cite quran|33|21|s=ns|b=n}}).

In Islamic tradition, this means that God sent Muhammad with his message to humanity the following of which will give people salvation in the [[afterlife]], and it is Muhammad's teachings and the purity of his personal life alone which keep alive the worship of God on this world.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Shafi Usmani |volume=6 |title= Tafsir Maariful Quran |url= http://www.islamibayanaat.com/MQ/English-MaarifulQuran-MuftiShafiUsmaniRA-Vol-6-Page-184-243.pdf |page=236 |url-status= live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219181058/http://www.islamibayanaat.com/MQ/English-MaarifulQuran-MuftiShafiUsmaniRA-Vol-6-Page-184-243.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-19 |author-link=Muhammad Shafi Usmani }}</ref>\n\n== Traditional Muslim account ==\n[[File:Prophet home mecca.jpg|thumb|right|The birthplace of Muhammad.

Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at [[Antioch]], which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and Mesopotamia was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as [[Suriyah]], to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the [[Orontes river]], in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and also in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature of some of the [[Eastern Christian]] churches, from which it occasionally found its way into Christian Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516031507/https://books.google.com/books?id=t_amYLJq4SQC |archivedate=2016-05-16 }}</ref> When Muhammad was six, he accompanied his mother Amina on her visit to Medina, probably to visit her late husband's tomb.

Adjacent to the mosque was built the quarters for Muhammad's family. As there was no definite arrangement for calling people to prayer, [[Bilal ibn Ribah]] was appointed to call people in a loud voice at each prayer time, a system later replaced by [[Adhan]] believed to be informed to Abdullah ibn Zayd in his dream, and liked and introduced by Muhammad.\n\nThe Emigrants of Mecca, known as [[Muhajirun]], had left almost everything there and came to Medina empty-handed. They were cordially welcomed and helped by the Muslims of Medina, known as [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] (the helpers). Muhammad made a [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|formal bond of fraternity among them]]<ref>Muir (1861), vol. 3, p. 17</ref> that went a long way in eliminating long-established enmity among various tribes, particularly [[Banu Aus|Aws]] and [[Khazraj]].<ref>[[Ibn Kathir]] (2001), Translated by Sayed Gad, p. 396</ref>\n\n==== Establishment of a new polity ====\n{{See also|Constitution of Medina}}\nAfter the arrival of Muhammad in Medina, its people could be divided into four groups:<ref>{{cite book| last=Khan |first=Muhammad Zafrullah |title=Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets |year = 1980 |publisher=[[Routledge & Kegan Paul]]|isbn=978-0-7100-0610-3|page=88}}</ref><ref>Sell (1913), pp. 86-87.</ref>\n# The Muslims: emigrants from Mecca and Ansars of Medina.\n# The [[Munafiq|hypocrites]]; they nominally embraced Islam, but actually were against it.\n# Those from [[Banu Aus|Aws]] and [[Khazraj]] who were still pagans, but were inclined to embrace Islam.\n# The Jews; they were huge in number and formed an important community there.\nIn order to establish peaceful coexistence among this heterogeneous population, Muhammad invited the leading personalities of all the communities to reach a formal agreement which would provide a harmony among the communities and security to the city of Medina, and finally drew up the [[Constitution of Medina]], also known as the Medina Charter, which formed \"a kind of alliance or federation\" among the prevailing communities.<ref name=\"Holt-41\"/> It specified the mutual rights and obligations of the Muslims and Jews of Medina, and prohibited any alliance with the outside enemies.

The arrival of Muhammad rendered this design unlikely, and from then [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy]] began entertaining hostility towards Muhammad.

In view of all this, the Quran granted permission to the persecuted Muslims to defend themselves: \"Permission to fight is granted to those against whom war is made, because they have been wronged, and God indeed has the power to help them. They are those who have been driven out of their homes unjustly only because they affirmed: \"Our Lord is God\"\" (Quran {{cite quran|22|39-40|s=ns|b=n}}). The Quran further justifies taking defensive measures by stating that \"And if God had not repelled some men by others, the earth would have been corrupted. But God is a Lord of Kindness to (His) creatures\" (Quran {{cite quran|2|251|s=ns|b=n}}). According to Quranic description, war is an abnormal and unenviable way which, when inevitable, should be limited to minimal casualty, and free from any kind of transgression on the part of the believers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Khan |first=Muhammad Zafrullah |title=Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets |year = 1980 |publisher=[[Routledge & Kegan Paul]]|isbn=978-0-7100-0610-3|page=94}}</ref> In this regard, the Quran says, \"Fight in the cause of God with those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors\" ({{cite quran|2|190|s=ns|b=n}}), and \"And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression\" ({{cite quran|2|193|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\nThus, to ensure the security of the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansars]] and [[Muhajirun]] of Medina, Muhammad resorted to the following measures:\n# Visiting the neighboring tribes to enter into non-aggression treaty with them to secure Medina from their attacks.<ref>Al Mubarakpuri (2002), \"Permission to fight\"</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Khan |first=Muhammad Zafrullah |title=Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets |year = 1980 |publisher=[[Routledge & Kegan Paul]]|isbn=978-0-7100-0610-3|page=95}}</ref>\n# Blocking or intercepting the trading caravans of the Quraysh to compel them into a compromise with the Muslims.

Men, women, and children, whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect; and raise for us from Thee one who will help!\"\" (Quran {{cite quran|4|75|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==== Battle of Badr ====\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Badr campaign recolorized.svg|thumb|right|A map of the Badr campaign]]\nA key battle in the early days of Islam, the [[Battle of Badr]] was the first large-scale battle between the nascent Islamic community of Medina and their opponent Quraysh of Mecca where the Muslims won a decisive victory. The battle has some background. In 2 AH (623 CE) in the month of [[Rajab]], a Muslim patrolling group attacked a Quraysh trading caravan killing its elite leader Amr ibn Hazrami. The incident happening in a sacred month displeased Muhammad, and enraged the Quraysh to a greater extent.<ref name=\"Shibli1\" /><ref>Haykal (2008), pp. 225\u201326</ref> The Quran however neutralizes the effect saying that bloodshed in sacred month is obviously prohibited, but Quraysh paganism, persecuting on the Meccan converts, and preventing people from the Sacred Mosque are greater sins (Quran {{cite quran|2|217|s=ns|b=n}}). Traditional sources say that upon receiving intelligence of a richly laden trading caravan of the Quraysh returning from Syria to Mecca, Muhammad took it as a good opportunity to strike a heavy blow on Meccan power by taking down the caravan in which almost all the Meccan people had invested.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Shafi Usmani |title= Tafsir Maariful Quran| volume=4|year=1986 |location= English Translation by Muhammad Shameem.

According to the Quran, Muhammad is the last in a chain of prophets sent by God ({{cite quran|33|40|s=ns|b=n}}). Throughout the Quran, Muhammad is referred to as \"Messenger\", \"Messenger of God\", and \"Prophet\". Some of such verses are 2:101, 2:143, 2:151, 3:32, 3:81, 3:144, 3:164, 4:79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7:157, 8:01, 9:3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09. Other terms are used, including \"Warner\", \"bearer of glad tidings\", and the \"one who invites people to a Single God\" (Quran {{cite quran|12|108|s=ns|b=n}}, and {{cite quran|33|45-46|s=ns|b=n}}). The Quran asserts that Muhammad was a man who possessed the highest moral excellence, and that God made him a good example or a \"goodly model\" for Muslims to follow (Quran {{cite quran|68|4|s=ns|b=n}}, and {{cite quran|33|21|s=ns|b=n}}).

Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at [[Antioch]], which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and Mesopotamia was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as [[Suriyah]], to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the [[Orontes river]], in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and also in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature of some of the [[Eastern Christian]] churches, from which it occasionally found its way into Christian Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516031507/https://books.google.com/books?id=t_amYLJq4SQC |archivedate=2016-05-16 }}</ref> When Muhammad was six, he accompanied his mother Amina on her visit to Medina, probably to visit her late husband's tomb.

The first to believe him was his wife [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid|Khadijah]], who was followed by [[Ali]], his cousin, and [[Zayd ibn Harithah]]. Notable among the early converts were [[Abu Bakr]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]], [[Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib]], [[Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas]], [[Abdullah, son of Masud|Abdullah ibn Masud]], [[Arqam]], [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]], [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] and [[Bilal ibn Rabah]]. In the fourth year of his prophethood, according to Islamic belief, he was ordered by God to make public his propagation of this monotheistic faith (Quran {{cite quran|15|94|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\nMuhammad's earliest teachings were marked by his insistence on the oneness of God (Quran {{cite quran|112|1|s=ns|b=n}}), the denunciation of polytheism (Quran {{cite quran|6|19|s=ns|b=n}}), belief in the [[Last judgment]] and its recompense (Quran {{cite quran|84|1|e=15|s=ns|b=n}}), and social and economic justice (Quran {{cite quran|89|17|e=20|s=ns|b=n}}).<ref name=\"Encarta1\" /> In a broader sense, Muhammad preached that he had been sent as God's messenger;<ref name=\"Campo 2009 p. 492\">Campo (2009), \"Muhammad\", ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 492.</ref> that God is [[Tawhid|One]] who is all-powerful, creator and controller of this universe (Quran {{cite quran|85|8|e=9|s=ns|b=n}}, Quran {{cite quran|6|2|s=ns|b=n}}), and merciful towards his creations (Quran {{cite quran|85|14|s=ns|b=n}});<ref name=Holt-32>{{cite book |editor1=Holt, P.

They are those who have been driven out of their homes unjustly only because they affirmed: \"Our Lord is God\"\" (Quran {{cite quran|22|39-40|s=ns|b=n}}). The Quran further justifies taking defensive measures by stating that \"And if God had not repelled some men by others, the earth would have been corrupted. But God is a Lord of Kindness to (His) creatures\" (Quran {{cite quran|2|251|s=ns|b=n}}). According to Quranic description, war is an abnormal and unenviable way which, when inevitable, should be limited to minimal casualty, and free from any kind of transgression on the part of the believers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Khan |first=Muhammad Zafrullah |title=Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets |year = 1980 |publisher=[[Routledge & Kegan Paul]]|isbn=978-0-7100-0610-3|page=94}}</ref> In this regard, the Quran says, \"Fight in the cause of God with those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors\" ({{cite quran|2|190|s=ns|b=n}}), and \"And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression\" ({{cite quran|2|193|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\nThus, to ensure the security of the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansars]] and [[Muhajirun]] of Medina, Muhammad resorted to the following measures:\n# Visiting the neighboring tribes to enter into non-aggression treaty with them to secure Medina from their attacks.<ref>Al Mubarakpuri (2002), \"Permission to fight\"</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Khan |first=Muhammad Zafrullah |title=Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets |year = 1980 |publisher=[[Routledge & Kegan Paul]]|isbn=978-0-7100-0610-3|page=95}}</ref>\n# Blocking or intercepting the trading caravans of the Quraysh to compel them into a compromise with the Muslims.

The battle has some background. In 2 AH (623 CE) in the month of [[Rajab]], a Muslim patrolling group attacked a Quraysh trading caravan killing its elite leader Amr ibn Hazrami. The incident happening in a sacred month displeased Muhammad, and enraged the Quraysh to a greater extent.<ref name=\"Shibli1\" /><ref>Haykal (2008), pp. 225\u201326</ref> The Quran however neutralizes the effect saying that bloodshed in sacred month is obviously prohibited, but Quraysh paganism, persecuting on the Meccan converts, and preventing people from the Sacred Mosque are greater sins (Quran {{cite quran|2|217|s=ns|b=n}}). Traditional sources say that upon receiving intelligence of a richly laden trading caravan of the Quraysh returning from Syria to Mecca, Muhammad took it as a good opportunity to strike a heavy blow on Meccan power by taking down the caravan in which almost all the Meccan people had invested.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Shafi Usmani |title= Tafsir Maariful Quran| volume=4|year=1986 |location= English Translation by Muhammad Shameem.

One such typical verse is \"And obey God and the Messenger so that you may be blessed\" (Quran {{cite quran|3|132|s=ns|b=n}}). The Quran uses two different terms to denote this: ''ita\u2019ah'' (to obey) and ''ittiba'' (to follow).

It was made and patented by [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]] after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by [[Erno Rubik]], and introduced by [[Tomy|Tomy Toys]] of Japan (then the 1st largest toy company in the world) in 1221.<ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles-pyraminx-kokonotsu.htm</ref>\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-3.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in the middle of a twist]]\n\nThe Pyraminx was first conceived by M\u00e8ffert in 1940.  He did nothing with his design until 1681 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production.  Uwe is fond of saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx would have never been produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe Pyraminx is a puzzle in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are [[octahedron|octahedral]] in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Meffert also produces a similar puzzle called the '''Tetraminx''', which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a [[truncated tetrahedron]].\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-4.jpg|frame|right|Scrambled Pyraminx]]\nThe purpose of the Pyraminx is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to their original configuration.\n\nThe 5 trivial tips can be easily rotated to line up with the axial piece they are respectively attached to, and the axial pieces are also easily rotated so that their colors line up with each other. This leaves only the 6 edge pieces as a real challenge to the puzzle. They can be solved by repeatedly applying two 4-twist sequences, which are mirror-image versions of each other. These sequences permute 3 edge pieces at a time and change their orientation differently, so that a combination of both sequences is sufficient to solve the puzzle. However, more efficient solutions (requiring a smaller total number of twists) are generally available (see below).\n\nThe twist of any axial piece is independent of the other three, as is the case with the tips. The six edges can be placed in 6!/2 positions and flipped in 2<sup>5</sup> ways, accounting for parity. Multiplying this by the 3<sup>8</sup> factor for the axial pieces gives 75,582,720 possible positions. However, setting the trivial tips to the right positions reduces the possibilities to 933,120, which is also the number of possible patterns on the Tetraminx. Setting the axial pieces as well reduces the figure to only 11,520, making this a rather simple puzzle to solve.\n\n== Optimal solutions ==\n\nThe maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions.

They can be split up into two groups.\n\n1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), is given to solve the remaining puzzle.\n\n2) Top first methods- In these methods, three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.\n\nCommon V first methods-\n\na) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.\n\nb) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.\n\nc) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method is not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.\n\nCommon top first methods-\n\na) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.\n\nb) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non-oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nc) OKA- In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nSome other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.\n\nMany Pyraminx speedsolvers learn several methods, and while observing a case, decide which method best suits that case.<ref name=\"results\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010BRAD01?tab=results-by-event&event=pyram - Drew Brads results.]</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Tetraminx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Tetraminx.]]\nThere are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, '''Tetraminx''', is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo).  There also exist \"higher-order\" versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor's Pyraminx.\n\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A basic pattern on a Master Pyraminx]]\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Solved.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Master Pyraminx]]\nThe '''Master Pyraminx''' has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the [[Skewb Diamond]] mechanism.  This version has about 2.6817 \u00d7 10<sup>15</sup> combinations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full List of Puzzles|url=http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|website=gandreas software|accessdate=2016-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428094549/http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|archive-date=28 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes on Twisty Puzzles|url=http://michael-gottlieb.blogspot.com/2008/05/number-of-positions-of-generalized.html|publisher=Michael Gottlieb|accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>  The Master Pyraminx has\n* 4 \"tips\" (same as the original Pyraminx)\n* 4 \"middle axials\"  (same as the original Pyraminx)\n* 4 \"centers\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)\n* 6 \"inner edges\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)\n* 12 \"outer edges\" (2-times more than the 6 of the original Pyraminx)\nIn summary, the Master Pyraminx has 30 \"manipulable\" pieces.  However, like the original, 8 of the pieces (the tips and middle axials) are fixed in position (relative to each other) and can only be rotated in place.  Also, the 4 centers are fixed in position and can only rotate (like the Rubik's Cube).  So there are only 18 (30-8-4) \"truly movable\" pieces; since this is 10% ''fewer'' than the 20 \"truly movable\" pieces of the Rubik's Cube, it should be no surprise that the Master Pyraminx has about 10,000-times ''fewer'' combinations than a Rubik's Cube (about 4.3252 \u00d7 10<sup>19</sup><ref>Martin Sch\u00f6nert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Pyraminx Duo]]\n*[[Pyramorphix]] and [[Pyramorphix#Master Pyramorphix|Master Pyramorphix]], two regular tetrahedron puzzles which resemble the Pyraminx but are mechanically very different from it\n* [[Pocket Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Revenge]]\n* [[Professor's Cube]]\n* [[V-Cube 6]]\n* [[V-Cube 7]]\n* [[V-Cube 8]]\n*[[Skewb]]\n*[[Skewb Diamond]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Dogic]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Tower Cube]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Pyraminx}}\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Jaap's Pyraminx and related puzzles page, with solution]\n*[http://www.puzzlesolver.com/puzzle.php?id=28 Pyraminx solution] from [http://www.puzzlesolver.com/ PuzzleSolver]\n*[ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Cards/txt/Pyramix.txt A solution to the Pyraminx]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Jonathan Bowen]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071231043207/http://www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia/PyraSol.html An efficient and easy to follow solution favoured by speed solvers]\n*[http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubik/pyraminx Patterns] A collection of pretty patterns for the Pyraminx\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:1980s toys]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Pyraminx solved.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in its solved state]]\n\nThe '''Pyraminx''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u026a|r|\u0259|m|\u026a|\u014b|k|s}}) is a regular [[tetrahedron]] puzzle in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]].

They can be split up into two groups.\n\n1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), is given to solve the remaining puzzle.\n\n2) Top first methods- In these methods, three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.\n\nCommon V first methods-\n\na) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.\n\nb) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.\n\nc) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method is not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.\n\nCommon top first methods-\n\na) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.\n\nb) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non-oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nc) OKA- In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nSome other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.\n\nMany Pyraminx speedsolvers learn several methods, and while observing a case, decide which method best suits that case.<ref name=\"results\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010BRAD01?tab=results-by-event&event=pyram - Drew Brads results.]</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Tetraminx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Tetraminx.]]\nThere are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, '''Tetraminx''', is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo).  There also exist \"higher-order\" versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor's Pyraminx.\n\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A basic pattern on a Master Pyraminx]]\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Solved.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Master Pyraminx]]\nThe '''Master Pyraminx''' has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the [[Skewb Diamond]] mechanism.  This version has about 2.6817 \u00d7 10<sup>15</sup> combinations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full List of Puzzles|url=http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|website=gandreas software|accessdate=2016-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428094549/http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|archive-date=28 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes on Twisty Puzzles|url=http://michael-gottlieb.blogspot.com/2008/05/number-of-positions-of-generalized.html|publisher=Michael Gottlieb|accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>  The Master Pyraminx has\n* 4 \"tips\" (same as the original Pyraminx)\n* 4 \"middle axials\"  (same as the original Pyraminx)\n* 4 \"centers\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)\n* 6 \"inner edges\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)\n* 12 \"outer edges\" (2-times more than the 6 of the original Pyraminx)\nIn summary, the Master Pyraminx has 30 \"manipulable\" pieces.  However, like the original, 8 of the pieces (the tips and middle axials) are fixed in position (relative to each other) and can only be rotated in place.  Also, the 4 centers are fixed in position and can only rotate (like the Rubik's Cube).  So there are only 18 (30-8-4) \"truly movable\" pieces; since this is 10% ''fewer'' than the 20 \"truly movable\" pieces of the Rubik's Cube, it should be no surprise that the Master Pyraminx has about 10,000-times ''fewer'' combinations than a Rubik's Cube (about 4.3252 \u00d7 10<sup>19</sup><ref>Martin Sch\u00f6nert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Pyraminx Duo]]\n*[[Pyramorphix]] and [[Pyramorphix#Master Pyramorphix|Master Pyramorphix]], two regular tetrahedron puzzles which resemble the Pyraminx but are mechanically very different from it\n* [[Pocket Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Revenge]]\n* [[Professor's Cube]]\n* [[V-Cube 6]]\n* [[V-Cube 7]]\n* [[V-Cube 8]]\n*[[Skewb]]\n*[[Skewb Diamond]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Dogic]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Tower Cube]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Pyraminx}}\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Jaap's Pyraminx and related puzzles page, with solution]\n*[http://www.puzzlesolver.com/puzzle.php?id=28 Pyraminx solution] from [http://www.puzzlesolver.com/ PuzzleSolver]\n*[ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Cards/txt/Pyramix.txt A solution to the Pyraminx]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Jonathan Bowen]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071231043207/http://www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia/PyraSol.html An efficient and easy to follow solution favoured by speed solvers]\n*[http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubik/pyraminx Patterns] A collection of pretty patterns for the Pyraminx\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:1980s toys]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n", "name_user": "Savage Panda", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I edited incorrect dates.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyraminx"}

Cover & G01a</ref> Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\n\nPre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]], featuring timber construction with large [[verandah]]s and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 12.6% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 10% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name=\"QS 3GBRI 2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=4 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081145/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |archivedate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]].

The city is centred along the [[Brisbane River]], and its eastern suburbs line the shores of [[Moreton Bay]], a bay of the [[Coral Sea]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.\n\nThe waters of Moreton Bay are relatively calm, being sheltered from large [[swell (ocean)|swells]] by [[Moreton Island|Moreton]], [[North Stradbroke Island|Stradbroke]] and [[Bribie Island|Bribie]] islands, whereas unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of the bay islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the north and south.\n\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly.<ref name=\"thenandnow\">{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=60 }}</ref> The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the [[Taylor Range (Queensland)|Herbert Taylor Range]], such as the summit of [[Mount Coot-tha, Queensland|Mount Coot-tha]], reaching up to {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and the smaller [[Enoggera Hill]].

These experimental TV broadcasts continued until World War II.<ref name=\"oldwindmill\"/> The Old Commissariat Store, on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used partly as a grainhouse, has also been a hostel for immigrants and used for the storage of records.

Cover & G01a</ref> Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\n\nPre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]], featuring timber construction with large [[verandah]]s and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 12.6% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 10% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name=\"QS 3GBRI 2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=4 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081145/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |archivedate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]].

It is famous for being the site of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865. After being shot, the fatally wounded 56-year old Lincoln  was carried across the street to the [[Petersen House]], where he died the next morning.\n\nThe theater was later used as a warehouse and office building, and in 1893 part of it collapsed, causing 22 deaths. It was renovated and re-opened as a theater in 1968. During the 2000s, it was renovated again, opening on February 12, 2009, in commemoration of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth.  A related Center for Education and Leadership museum experience opened February 12, 2012, next to Petersen House.\n\nThe Petersen House and the theater are preserved together as '''Ford's Theatre National Historic Site''', administered by the [[National Park Service]]; programming within the theater and the Center for Education is overseen separately by the Ford's Theatre Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fords.org/home/about-fords|title=About \u00b7 Ford's Theatre|website=fords.org}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900 - Restoration.jpg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|Depiction of the assassination of Abraham  Lincoln, showing [[John Wilkes Booth|Booth]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]].]]\n\n[[File:Ford's Theatre interior, Washington, D.C.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View from beneath the balcony. The Presidential Box is at right.]]\n\nThe site was originally a house of worship, constructed in 1833 as the second meeting house of the [[The First Baptist Church of the City of Washington, DC|First Baptist Church]] of Washington, with [[Obadiah Bruen Brown]] as the pastor. In 1861, after the congregation moved to a newly built structure, [[John T. Ford]] bought the former church and renovated it into a theater. He first called it Ford's Athenaeum. It was destroyed by fire in 1862, and was rebuilt.\n\n=== Assassination of President Lincoln ===\n{{See also|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nOn April 14, 1865\u2014just five days after [[Robert E. Lee|General Lee]]'s surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]\u2014Lincoln and his wife attended a performance of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theatre. The famous actor [[John Wilkes Booth]], desperate to aid the dying [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], made his way into the presidential box and shot Lincoln. Booth then jumped down to the stage, and escaped through a rear door.<ref>{{cite book|\nlast=Donald|first=David Herbert|authorlink=David Herbert Donald|title=Lincoln|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=1995|isbn=0-684-80846-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gene|title=American Gothic: the story of America's legendary theatrical family, Junius, Edwin, and John Wilkes Booth|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York|year=1992|isbn=0-671-76713-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671767136/page/154 154]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671767136/page/154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|\nlast=Goodrich|first=Thomas|title=The Darkest Dawn|publisher=Indiana University|location=Bloomington, Ind.|year=2005|isbn=0-253-32599-4|page=97}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the assassination, the United States Government appropriated the theater, with [[United States Congress|Congress]] paying Ford [[United States dollar|$]]88,000 in compensation,<ref>Anderson, Brian (2014).

Between 1866 and 1887, the theater was taken over by the U.S. military and served as a facility for the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] with records kept on the first floor, the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] on the second floor, and the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]] on the third. In 1887, the building exclusively became a clerk's office for the War Department, when the medical departments moved out.\n\n=== Disrepair and restoration ===\n{{See also|United States Congress Joint Committee on the Ford's Theater Disaster}}On June 9, 1893, the front part of the building collapsed, killing 22 clerks and injuring another 68. This led some people to believe that the former church turned theater and storeroom was cursed. The building was repaired and used as a government [[warehouse]] until 1911.\n\nIt languished unused until 1918. In 1928,<ref>Anderson, Brian (2014). Images of America: Ford's Theatre.

Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing. p. 72. {{ISBN|978-1-4671-2112-5}}</ref> In 1933, the building was transferred to the [[National Park Service]].\n\nThe restoration of Ford's Theatre was brought about by the two decade-long lobbying efforts of Democratic National Committeeman Melvin D. Hildreth and Republican [[North Dakota]] Representative [[Milton Young]]. Hildreth first suggested to Young the need for its restoration in 1945.

It is famous for being the site of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865. After being shot, the fatally wounded 56-year old Lincoln  was carried across the street to the [[Petersen House]], where he died the next morning.\n\nThe theater was later used as a warehouse and office building, and in 1893 part of it collapsed, causing 22 deaths. It was renovated and re-opened as a theater in 1968. During the 2000s, it was renovated again, opening on February 12, 2009, in commemoration of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth.  A related Center for Education and Leadership museum experience opened February 12, 2012, next to Petersen House.\n\nThe Petersen House and the theater are preserved together as '''Ford's Theatre National Historic Site''', administered by the [[National Park Service]]; programming within the theater and the Center for Education is overseen separately by the Ford's Theatre Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fords.org/home/about-fords|title=About \u00b7 Ford's Theatre|website=fords.org}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900 - Restoration.jpg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|Depiction of the assassination of Abraham  Lincoln, showing [[John Wilkes Booth|Booth]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]].]]\n\n[[File:Ford's Theatre interior, Washington, D.C.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View from beneath the balcony. The Presidential Box is at right.]]\n\nThe site was originally a house of worship, constructed in 1833 as the second meeting house of the [[The First Baptist Church of the City of Washington, DC|First Baptist Church]] of Washington, with [[Obadiah Bruen Brown]] as the pastor. In 1861, after the congregation moved to a newly built structure, [[John T. Ford]] bought the former church and renovated it into a theater. He first called it Ford's Athenaeum. It was destroyed by fire in 1862, and was rebuilt.\n\n=== Assassination of President Lincoln ===\n{{See also|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nOn April 14, 1865\u2014just five days after [[Robert E. Lee|General Lee]]'s surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]\u2014Lincoln and his wife attended a performance of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theatre. The famous actor [[John Wilkes Booth]], desperate to aid the dying [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], made his way into the presidential box and shot Lincoln.

Between 1866 and 1887, the theater was taken over by the U.S. military and served as a facility for the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] with records kept on the first floor, the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] on the second floor, and the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]] on the third. In 1887, the building exclusively became a clerk's office for the War Department, when the medical departments moved out.\n\n=== Disrepair and restoration ===\n{{See also|United States Congress Joint Committee on the Ford's Theater Disaster}}On June 9, 1893, the front part of the building collapsed, killing 22 clerks and injuring another 68. This led some people to believe that the former church turned theater and storeroom was cursed. The building was repaired and used as a government [[warehouse]] until 1911.\n\nIt languished unused until 1918. In 1928,<ref>Anderson, Brian (2014). Images of America: Ford's Theatre.

[[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.  In 1978, four tracks from ''[[Thank God It's Friday (soundtrack)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' ([[Donna Summer]], [[Pattie Brooks]], [[Love & Kisses]], [[Sunshine (American band)|Sunshine]]); in 1980, three tracks from ''[[Fame (soundtrack)|Fame]]'' (two by [[Irene Cara]] and one by [[Linda Clifford]]); and in 1985, two songs from ''[[Beverly Hills Cop#Soundtrack|Beverly Hills Cop]]'' ([[Patti LaBelle]], [[Harold Faltermeyer]]) hit number one together.\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] additionally became the first act to have scored at least one No. 1 on the Dance Club Songs chart in five separate decades since the chart's inception in 1976, having tallied 9 in the 1980s, 13 in the '90s, 18 in the 2000s, 9 in the '10s and, now, one (so far) in the '20s.\n*[[The Trammps]] are the only act to replace themselves at number one (issue date June 5, 1976, \"That's Where the Happy People Go\" \u2192 \"Disco Party\").<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The longest running number-ones on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart are \"[[Bad Luck (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Bad Luck]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]{{sup|2}} in 1975 and the album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' by [[Michael Jackson]].

The chart went on to feature playlists from various cities around the country from week to week. ''Billboard'' continued to run regional and city-specific charts throughout 1975 and 1976 until the issue dated August 28, 1976, when a 30-position ''National Disco Action Top 30'' premiered.  This quickly expanded to 40 positions, then in 1979 the chart expanded to 60 positions, then 80, and eventually reached 100 positions from 1979 until 1981, when it was reduced to 80 again.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003|isbn=0-89820-156-X|publisher=Record Research|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 1980s the chart maintained 80 slots until March 16, 1985 when the Disco charts were splintered and renamed. Two charts appeared: ''Hot Dance/Disco'', which ranked club play (50 positions), and ''[[Hot Dance Singles Sales|Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]]'', which ranked [[12-inch single]] (or maxi-single) sales (also 50 positions, later reduced to 10 and discontinued after 2013, replaced with [[Dance/Electronic Digital Songs]]).\n\nOnly ''Hot Dance Club Songs'' still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Hot+Dance+Singles+Sales |title=\u2013 Charts \u2013 Singles \u2013 Hot Dance Singles Sales |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref>  In 2003 ''Billboard'' introduced the '''Hot Dance Airplay''' chart (now known as '''[[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]'''), which is based solely on radio airplay of six dance music stations and top 40 mix shows electronically monitored by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Hot+Dance+Airplay |title=\u2013 Charts \u2013 Singles \u2013 Hot Dance Airplay |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref> These stations are also a part of the electronically monitored panel that encompasses the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].\n\nOn January 26, 2013, ''Billboard'' added a new chart, '''[[Dance/Electronic Songs]]''', which tracks the 50 most popular Dance and Electronic singles and tracks based on digital single sales, streaming, radio airplay, and club play as reported on the component Dance/Electronic Digital Songs, Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs, and Dance Club Songs charts.

[[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.

The term presupposes a sexual strategy among women whereby they favor the alpha male, and engage in sex with him, but that they cannot get him to commit and as such settle for less attractive betas primarily for financial purposes as a secondary option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/what-thotaudit-viral-campaign-encourages-right-wing-incels-report-internet-1231690|title=What is the #ThotAudit campaign gaining traction among alt-right trolls?|first=Dan Cancian On 11/26/18 at 11:49 AM|last=EST|date=November 26, 2018|website=Newsweek}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xmaze/learn-to-decode-the-secret-language-of-the-incel-subculture|title=Learn to Decode the Secret Language of the Incel Subculture|first=Allie|last=Conti|date=June 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/07/01/feminism_is_a_sexual_strategy_inside_the_angry_online_mens_rights_group_red_pill/|title=\"Feminism is a sexual strategy\": Inside the angry online men's rights group \"Red Pill\"|date=July 2, 2014|website=Salon}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Cuckservative]]\n*[[Cuckold]]\n*[[Internet slang]]\n*[[Neckbeard (slang)]]\n*[[Nice guy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for men]]\n", "name_user": "69.107.138.208", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_male_(slang)"}
