The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $21 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Robert Bilott]] is a corporate defense lawyer from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] working for law firm [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Robert's grandmother, asks Robert to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation [[DuPont (1802-2017)|DuPont]], and gives Robert a large case of videotapes.\n\nRobert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly tells him he is not aware of the case but will help out in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information through [[legal discovery]] of the chemicals dumped on the site. When he finds nothing useful in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] report, he realizes the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA.\n\nRobert confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He has discovered that PFOA is [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], used to manufacture [[Teflon]] and used in American homes for nonstick pans. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances#Forever chemicals|forever chemicals]], chemicals that do not leave the blood stream [[Bioaccumulation|and slowly accumulate]].\n\nTennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and he and his wife both have cancer. Robert encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but Tennant refuses, wanting justice. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.\n\nRobert, however, is not satisfied; he realizes that the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He seeks [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] for all residents of Parkersburg in one large [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]]. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the [[statute of limitations]] and giving any further action only a month to begin.\n\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that 150 parts per billion is safe. The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up. To get data for it, DuPont tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.\n\nSeven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Robert becomes destitute following several pay cuts, straining his marriage. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an [[ischemia]], brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help.\n\nThe scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. Robert decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Robert Bilott]]\n*

When ''Dark Waters'' was released on November 12, DuPont's stock price dropped even further by 7.15 points from 72.18 to 65.03. While the portfolio is now a part of [[Chemours]] and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith. Chemours estimated that it would need to pay over $200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina caused by another PFAS manufacturing facility in that region. (The prior settlement in both West Virginia and Ohio cost $671 million, which was split between the two companies.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|title=Here's Why DuPont Fell 40.5% in 2019|last=Chatsko|first=Maxx|date=January 9, 2020|website=Fool|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402145208/https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|archive-date=April 2, 2020|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuPont CEO Marc Doyle, executives, and investors argued in internal statements that much of the movie was not based in fact and DuPont was misconstrued to fit the role of the enemy.

The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $21 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Robert Bilott]] is a corporate defense lawyer from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] working for law firm [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Robert's grandmother, asks Robert to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation [[DuPont (1802-2017)|DuPont]], and gives Robert a large case of videotapes.\n\nRobert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly tells him he is not aware of the case but will help out in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information through [[legal discovery]] of the chemicals dumped on the site. When he finds nothing useful in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] report, he realizes the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA.\n\nRobert confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He has discovered that PFOA is [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], used to manufacture [[Teflon]] and used in American homes for nonstick pans. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances#Forever chemicals|forever chemicals]], chemicals that do not leave the blood stream [[Bioaccumulation|and slowly accumulate]].\n\nTennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and he and his wife both have cancer. Robert encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but Tennant refuses, wanting justice. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.\n\nRobert, however, is not satisfied; he realizes that the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He seeks [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] for all residents of Parkersburg in one large [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]]. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the [[statute of limitations]] and giving any further action only a month to begin.\n\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that 150 parts per billion is safe. The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up. To get data for it, DuPont tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.\n\nSeven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Robert becomes destitute following several pay cuts, straining his marriage. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an [[ischemia]], brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help.\n\nThe scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. Robert decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Robert Bilott]]\n*

When ''Dark Waters'' was released on November 12, DuPont's stock price dropped even further by 7.15 points from 72.18 to 65.03. While the portfolio is now a part of [[Chemours]] and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith. Chemours estimated that it would need to pay over $200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina caused by another PFAS manufacturing facility in that region. (The prior settlement in both West Virginia and Ohio cost $671 million, which was split between the two companies.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|title=Here's Why DuPont Fell 40.5% in 2019|last=Chatsko|first=Maxx|date=January 9, 2020|website=Fool|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402145208/https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|archive-date=April 2, 2020|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuPont CEO Marc Doyle, executives, and investors argued in internal statements that much of the movie was not based in fact and DuPont was misconstrued to fit the role of the enemy.

From 2006 to 2011, four versions of Lecture Quiz were developed, where the main changes were related to improved usability, making it easier to create quizzes, and using newer technology for implementation.\n\nLecture Quiz 2.0 was the first prototype where both teacher and student clients had web-interfaces.

A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear-out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|year=2015|title=The wear out effect of a game-based student response system|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+wear+out+effect+of+a+game-based+student+response+system%22&btnG=|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=82|pages=217\u2013227|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.004|hdl=11250/2496267|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!.\n\nThere is also research that investigates how Kahoot! performs compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Zhu|first2=Meng|last3=S\u00e6tre|first3=Rune|year=2016|title=The effect of digitizing and gratifying quizzing in classrooms|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=%22The+Effect+of+Digitizing+and+Gamifying+Quizzing+in+Classrooms%22|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International|volume=10|pages=729\u2013736|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes.\n\nAnother quasi-experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Lieberoth|first2=Andreas|year=2016|title=The effect of points and audio on concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation, and classroom dynamics using Kahoot!|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+effect+of+points+and+audio+on+concentration%2C+engagement%2C+enjoyment%2C+learning%2C+motivation%2C+and+classroom+dynamics+using+Kahoot%21%22&btnG=|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences International Limited|volume=10|pages=737\u2013746|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio.\n\nAccording to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the [[network latency]] in accessing the website greatly influences the [[quality of experience]] of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross-section studies, with a sample size N=21.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Underdal|first1=Anlaug G\u00e5rdsrud|last2=Sunde|first2=Marthe Thorine|title=Investigating QoE in a Cloud-Based Classroom Response System|date=5 September 2014|hdl=11250/262998}}</ref> It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay.\n\nA [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300208 literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning] was published in the journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-education Computers & Education] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Tahir|first2=Rabail|year=2020|title=The effect of using Kahoot! for learning \u2013 A literature review|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=149|pages=103818|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103818|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom. The focus of the review is on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attuites and perceptions, and student anxiety. The main conclusion is that Kahoot! has a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, attuites, and anxiety, and the main challenges include technical problems, see questions and answers, time stress, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up. Studies included in this review use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods that reveal among other things that Kahoot! has statistical significant improvement in learning performance compared to traditional teaching and other tools, a statistically significant improvement on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 perception of lectures, statistically significant improvement in classroom dynamics, and that Kahoot! can reduce students\u2019 anxiety compared to traditional teaching and other tools.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nKahoot!'s growing popularity in schools led to it becoming an [[Internet meme]].

From 2006 to 2011, four versions of Lecture Quiz were developed, where the main changes were related to improved usability, making it easier to create quizzes, and using newer technology for implementation.\n\nLecture Quiz 2.0 was the first prototype where both teacher and student clients had web-interfaces. An experiment testing the 2.0 prototype showed that the usability had been improved both for the teacher and the student clients, and that the concept increased students' motivation, engagement, concentration and perceived learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Bian|last2=Wang|first2=Alf Inge|last3=B\u00f8rresen|first3=Erling Andreas|last4=Tidemann|first4=Knut Andre|year=2011|title=Improvement of a Lecture Game Concept - Implementing Lecture Quiz 2.0.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221130592|journal=International Conference on Computer Supported Education|volume=3|pages=26\u201335|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> The last version of Lecture Quiz was version 3.0, with significantly improved user-interface implemented using [[HTML5|HTML 5]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS3]], avatars, and multiple game/team modes.

A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear-out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|year=2015|title=The wear out effect of a game-based student response system|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+wear+out+effect+of+a+game-based+student+response+system%22&btnG=|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=82|pages=217\u2013227|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.004|hdl=11250/2496267|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!.\n\nThere is also research that investigates how Kahoot! performs compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Zhu|first2=Meng|last3=S\u00e6tre|first3=Rune|year=2016|title=The effect of digitizing and gratifying quizzing in classrooms|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=%22The+Effect+of+Digitizing+and+Gamifying+Quizzing+in+Classrooms%22|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International|volume=10|pages=729\u2013736|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes.\n\nAnother quasi-experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Lieberoth|first2=Andreas|year=2016|title=The effect of points and audio on concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation, and classroom dynamics using Kahoot!|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+effect+of+points+and+audio+on+concentration%2C+engagement%2C+enjoyment%2C+learning%2C+motivation%2C+and+classroom+dynamics+using+Kahoot%21%22&btnG=|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences International Limited|volume=10|pages=737\u2013746|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio.\n\nAccording to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the [[network latency]] in accessing the website greatly influences the [[quality of experience]] of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross-section studies, with a sample size N=21.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Underdal|first1=Anlaug G\u00e5rdsrud|last2=Sunde|first2=Marthe Thorine|title=Investigating QoE in a Cloud-Based Classroom Response System|date=5 September 2014|hdl=11250/262998}}</ref> It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay.\n\nA [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300208 literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning] was published in the journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-education Computers & Education] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Tahir|first2=Rabail|year=2020|title=The effect of using Kahoot! for learning \u2013 A literature review|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=149|pages=103818|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103818|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom. The focus of the review is on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attuites and perceptions, and student anxiety. The main conclusion is that Kahoot! has a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, attuites, and anxiety, and the main challenges include technical problems, see questions and answers, time stress, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up. Studies included in this review use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods that reveal among other things that Kahoot! has statistical significant improvement in learning performance compared to traditional teaching and other tools, a statistically significant improvement on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 perception of lectures, statistically significant improvement in classroom dynamics, and that Kahoot! can reduce students\u2019 anxiety compared to traditional teaching and other tools.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nKahoot!'s growing popularity in schools led to it becoming an [[Internet meme]].
