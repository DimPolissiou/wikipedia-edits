He professed his [[religious vows]] on 7 August 1903, after which he was drafted to fulfill his military obligations by serving in the medical corps in [[Treviso]] from 1904-1906. He returned to the Carmelite monastery and was sent to complete his [[seminary]] studies, professing his [[solemn vows]] on 7 August 1907. He was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] on 19 December 1908 by the [[Patriarch of Venice]].

In 1922 he was called to Rome to serve as the Secretary to the Prior General of the Order, serving in that position until 1925, when he was elected as the [[procurator (Catholic Church)|Procurator]] General of the Order. On 29 January 1930, Piazza was appointed as the [[Archbishop of Benevento]], for which office he was [[consecrated]] as a [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] the following 24 February in the Discalced Carmelite Church of [[S.

As cardinal, Piazza participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1939|Papal conclave]] of 1939 that elected [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\nPiazza remained Patriarch of Venice until 1948 at which time he was named by Pope Pius XII as the Secretary of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation (now called the [[Congregation for Bishops]]).

The Runnin' Rebels, coached by [[Jerry Tarkanian]], entered the season as [[1989\u201390 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|defending national champions]] and entered the [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991 NCAA tournament]] unbeaten, but lost in the national semifinal to eventual champions [[1990\u201391 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] when [[Anderson Hunt]]'s desperation three in the final seconds bounced off the backboard and into the hands of a Duke player, [[Bobby Hurley]], ending a 45-game winning streak that dated back to the previous season. They had been the last team to [[Perfect season#NCAA Division I Basketball|finish the regular season unbeaten]] before [[2003\u201304 Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball team|St. Joseph's]] did it in 2004. They were the last team to enter the NCAA tournament unbeaten until [[2013\u201314 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] did it in 2014 and [[2014\u201315 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 2015.\n\nThe team played its home games in the [[Thomas & Mack Center]], and was a member of the [[Big West Conference]]; it would join the [[Western Athletic Conference]] in 1996 and become a charter member of its current conference, the [[Mountain West Conference]], in 1999.\n\nThe nickname \"Runnin' Rebels\" is unique to men's basketball at UNLV. The default nickname for men's sports teams at the school is simply \"Rebels\", while all women's teams are known as \"Lady Rebels\".\n\n==Roster==\n{{CBB roster/Header|year=1990|team=UNLV Runnin'

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940).

After hours of closed-door debate at the annual national meeting in New York, the proposal was withdrawn.<ref name=\"Woolhouse\" /> The organization ultimately issued a one-sentence statement, saying \"The National Commission of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today, at its annual meeting, decided to take no further action on the issue of the Armenian genocide.\"<ref>http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5162_00.htm</ref>\n\nThe ADL was criticized by many in the Armenian community, including ''The Armenian Weekly'' newspaper, in which writer Michael Mensoian stated:\n\n{{quote|The belated backtracking of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in acknowledging the planned, systematic massacre of 1,500,000 Armenian men, women and children as \"\u2026tantamount to genocide\u2026\" is discouraging. Tantamount means something is equivalent. If it's equivalent, why avoid using the term? For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

After hours of closed-door debate at the annual national meeting in New York, the proposal was withdrawn.<ref name=\"Woolhouse\" /> The organization ultimately issued a one-sentence statement, saying \"The National Commission of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today, at its annual meeting, decided to take no further action on the issue of the Armenian genocide.\"<ref>http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5162_00.htm</ref>\n\nThe ADL was criticized by many in the Armenian community, including ''The Armenian Weekly'' newspaper, in which writer Michael Mensoian stated:\n\n{{quote|The belated backtracking of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in acknowledging the planned, systematic massacre of 1,500,000 Armenian men, women and children as \"\u2026tantamount to genocide\u2026\" is discouraging. Tantamount means something is equivalent. If it's equivalent, why avoid using the term? For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

The bridge was opened to traffic in stages as the approaches were completed between June 1962 and September 1964. It was subsequently connected to the Bonaventure Expressway, which was part of the north approach to the bridge. The expressway was opened to traffic on April 21, 1967.

The city's existing bridges ([[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria]], [[Jacques Cartier Bridge|Cartier]], and [[Honor\u00e9 Mercier Bridge|Mercier]]) had become inadequate to support the amount of traffic that carried residents from the growing South Shore suburbs into Montreal.\n\nThe project was initially called the Nuns' Island Bridge because it crosses [[Nuns' Island]]. In 1958, it was named the Champlain Bridge in honour of the explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]].\n\nThe [[National Harbours Board]] was placed in charge of the project. Through several lengthy meetings and consultations in the fall of 1955, the location for the bridge and its approaches were selected. Originally, the plan had been to build the bridge with only 4 lanes, with room for further expansion to 6 lanes. During the design phase, however, it was decided to go with an initial 6-lane design.\n\nIt was opened on June 28, 1962 at 4 p.m. with only one approach from Montreal, via [[Wellington Street, Montreal|Wellington Street]]. A section including approaches to and from [[Atwater Street]] and La V\u00e9rendrye Boulevard were opened two years later.\n\nIn 1967, the final approach to the bridge on the Montr\u00e9al side was completed when the [[Quebec Autoroute 10|Bonaventure Expressway]] was opened to traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjcci.ca/English/pdf/CHAMPLAIN-INTERNET-ang.pdf|title=The Champlain Bridge and the Bonaventure Expressway|accessdate=2008-07-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625074337/http://www.pjcci.ca/English/pdf/CHAMPLAIN-INTERNET-ang.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\nA $0.25 toll ($0.08 if paid with tokens) was charged to finance the $35{{nbsp}}million cost of the Champlain Bridge. The toll was collected until 1990, when the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI), which took over jurisdiction of the bridge a dozen years earlier, removed the toll plaza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealroads.com/crossings/champlain|title=The Champlain Bridge:Historic overview |accessdate=2009-04-29|author= |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Structural health==\n\nMontreal's climate subjects the Champlain Bridge to wintry cold, snowfall, and windy conditions, as well as contrasting hot and humid summer conditions, all of which accelerate damage to the bridge. Because of the potential danger from ice accumulation during winter, the bridge was [[road salt|salted]] every season for decades. But [[Concrete degradation#Chlorides|salt attacks]] both the concrete and steel [[rebar]] used in girders, pylons, and other parts. The problems associated with the design and maintenance of the Champlain Bridge have thus advanced the useful life of several structural components. The design and construction of the structure prevent the isolation of outdated elements and replace them with new ones, as can be done on other structures. Given the state of advanced deterioration of the bridge, it is constantly monitored by 300 sensors.\n\nSeveral reinforcement measures and rehabilitation programs have been deployed over time by JCCBI.\n\nIn 1992, the concrete deck of the cantilever metal part was replaced by an orthotropic steel deck. Gutters to channel the corrosive runoff to the river appeared in 1994. The pressure exerted by the reinforced beams on the ends of the trimmers then required the reinforcement of the latter by steel rods under tension.\n\nIn 2009, the Government of Canada announced in its 2009 Economic Action Plan that it would be allocating $212{{nbsp}}million to renew the bridge. And in March 2011, the Government of Canada announced $158{{nbsp}}million would be spent on a major repair and maintenance program as concerns mount it is at risk of collapse. Montreal's ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' newspaper cited two leaked engineering reports prepared for a federal bridge agency that suggest sections of the structure are in a severe state of deterioration that will progress exponentially. The report concludes that a partial or complete collapse of the span should not be ruled out.<ref>{{cite news|title = Montreal bridge gets $158M in repair funds|publisher = CBC News|date = 2011-03-18|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2011/03/18/champlain-bridge-repair-funding.html|accessdate = 2011-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, JCCBI has been conducting a major repair program to extend the usefulness of the Champlain Bridge while ensuring the safety of users. The installation of sensors helps monitor the structure's behaviour day and night. This repair program was scheduled to be completed in 2018.\n\nIn 2010, JCCBI \u2014 the Federal agency that oversees the structure \u2014 retained international engineering firm [[Delcan]] to carry out an expert study of the bridge's structural health. The firm returned a report entitled, \"The Future of the Champlain Bridge Crossing\". In the Executive Summary, the bridge was said to be \"functionally deficient\" for both current and long-term traffic demands, and showing \"significant deterioration\".<ref name=Delcan>{{cite web |url=http://www.pjcci.ca/Francais/champlain/Future%20of%20the%20Champlain%20Bridge%20Mar%2028%2011.pdf |title=Future of the Champlain Bridge Crossing |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-04-11 |publisher=pjcci.ca |author=Delcan, Inc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723164205/http://www.pjcci.ca/Francais/champlain/Future%20of%20the%20Champlain%20Bridge%20Mar%2028%2011.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}</ref> One finding suggested that the Champlain Bridge is in \"very much poorer condition than would be typical\" for comparable bridges. Delcan concluded that the bridge had \"many deficiencies\" and, even in light of the methodical inspection and rehabilitation of the structure undertaken by its owners, that continued operation \"entails some risks that cannot altogether be quantified\".\n\nThe [[CBC Television]] and [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada]], among other news agencies, have published segments highlighting concerns over conditions of surface roads in [[Montreal]] and the Champlain Bridge in particular.\n\nIn November 2013, a crack was discovered in a critical part of the superstructure. One lane was closed immediately and emergency repair plans were put in place. During preparation, the crack enlarged and a second lane was closed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pontchamplainbridge.ca/en/champlain-bridge-two-lanes-per-direction-next-weeks-support-beam-operation-underway/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202162455/http://www.pontchamplainbridge.ca/en/champlain-bridge-two-lanes-per-direction-next-weeks-support-beam-operation-underway/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}</ref>\n\nOn November 29, 2013, a temporary external beam of 75 tons, named \"super-beam\" by the media, was urgently installed to reinforce the structure. In June 2014, JCCBI replaced the super-beam with first modular truss that was designed and manufactured in Quebec.\n\nAs part of a 2014\u20132017 Edge girder reinforcement program, 94 modular trusses and six shoring systems were installed to stabilize the condition of the bridge girders.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[List of longest bridges in the world]]\n*

The bridge carried six lanes of vehicle traffic; three in each direction. During rush hour one lane of those heading off the island in the morning, and onto the island in the evening, was used as a reserved [[bus lane]] for buses to be able to head in the opposite direction. The bridge was opened to traffic in stages as the approaches were completed between June 1962 and September 1964. It was subsequently connected to the Bonaventure Expressway, which was part of the north approach to the bridge. The expressway was opened to traffic on April 21, 1967. It was one of North America's busiest highways with almost 59{{nbsp}}million crossings annually.\n*Total length of crossing complex: {{convert|14.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}\n*Total bridge length including approaches: {{convert|7,412|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n**Length: abutment to abutment: {{convert|3,440|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n**Link of viaduct to Section 1: {{convert|2,195|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n**Center main cantilevered span: {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n**Wellington Street approach: {{convert|365|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Bonaventure Expressway: {{convert|4,573|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\nJust upstream from the bridge there is an ice boom, the Champlain Bridge Ice Control Structure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jacquescartierchamplain.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11249_Casacom_FichePontChamplain_EN_2016-10-24.pdf|title=Technical Data Sheet - Champlain Bridge Sector|website=PJCCI.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183308/http://jacquescartierchamplain.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11249_Casacom_FichePontChamplain_EN_2016-10-24.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Construction history==\n[[File:Champlain Bridge Montreal.jpg|thumb|right|View from the east side of the Saint Lawrence River, July 2011]]\n[[File:Champlain Bridge over Saint Lawrence.JPG|thumb|right|The upstream ice control structure.]]\nOn August 17, 1955, Federal Transport Minister [[George Marler]] announced the planned construction of a new bridge connecting Montreal to the South Shore via Nun's Island. The city's existing bridges ([[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria]], [[Jacques Cartier Bridge|Cartier]], and [[Honor\u00e9 Mercier Bridge|Mercier]]) had become inadequate to support the amount of traffic that carried residents from the growing South Shore suburbs into Montreal.\n\nThe project was initially called the Nuns' Island Bridge because it crosses [[Nuns' Island]]. In 1958, it was named the Champlain Bridge in honour of the explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]].\n\nThe [[National Harbours Board]] was placed in charge of the project. Through several lengthy meetings and consultations in the fall of 1955, the location for the bridge and its approaches were selected. Originally, the plan had been to build the bridge with only 4 lanes, with room for further expansion to 6 lanes. During the design phase, however, it was decided to go with an initial 6-lane design.\n\nIt was opened on June 28, 1962 at 4 p.m. with only one approach from Montreal, via [[Wellington Street, Montreal|Wellington Street]]. A section including approaches to and from [[Atwater Street]] and La V\u00e9rendrye Boulevard were opened two years later.\n\nIn 1967, the final approach to the bridge on the Montr\u00e9al side was completed when the [[Quebec Autoroute 10|Bonaventure Expressway]] was opened to traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjcci.ca/English/pdf/CHAMPLAIN-INTERNET-ang.pdf|title=The Champlain Bridge and the Bonaventure Expressway|accessdate=2008-07-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625074337/http://www.pjcci.ca/English/pdf/CHAMPLAIN-INTERNET-ang.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\nA $0.25 toll ($0.08 if paid with tokens) was charged to finance the $35{{nbsp}}million cost of the Champlain Bridge. The toll was collected until 1990, when the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI), which took over jurisdiction of the bridge a dozen years earlier, removed the toll plaza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealroads.com/crossings/champlain|title=The Champlain Bridge:Historic overview |accessdate=2009-04-29|author= |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Structural health==\n\nMontreal's climate subjects the Champlain Bridge to wintry cold, snowfall, and windy conditions, as well as contrasting hot and humid summer conditions, all of which accelerate damage to the bridge. Because of the potential danger from ice accumulation during winter, the bridge was [[road salt|salted]] every season for decades. But [[Concrete degradation#Chlorides|salt attacks]] both the concrete and steel [[rebar]] used in girders, pylons, and other parts. The problems associated with the design and maintenance of the Champlain Bridge have thus advanced the useful life of several structural components. The design and construction of the structure prevent the isolation of outdated elements and replace them with new ones, as can be done on other structures. Given the state of advanced deterioration of the bridge, it is constantly monitored by 300 sensors.\n\nSeveral reinforcement measures and rehabilitation programs have been deployed over time by JCCBI.\n\nIn 1992, the concrete deck of the cantilever metal part was replaced by an orthotropic steel deck. Gutters to channel the corrosive runoff to the river appeared in 1994. The pressure exerted by the reinforced beams on the ends of the trimmers then required the reinforcement of the latter by steel rods under tension.\n\nIn 2009, the Government of Canada announced in its 2009 Economic Action Plan that it would be allocating $212{{nbsp}}million to renew the bridge. And in March 2011, the Government of Canada announced $158{{nbsp}}million would be spent on a major repair and maintenance program as concerns mount it is at risk of collapse. Montreal's ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' newspaper cited two leaked engineering reports prepared for a federal bridge agency that suggest sections of the structure are in a severe state of deterioration that will progress exponentially. The report concludes that a partial or complete collapse of the span should not be ruled out.<ref>{{cite news|title = Montreal bridge gets $158M in repair funds|publisher = CBC News|date = 2011-03-18|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2011/03/18/champlain-bridge-repair-funding.html|accessdate = 2011-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, JCCBI has been conducting a major repair program to extend the usefulness of the Champlain Bridge while ensuring the safety of users. The installation of sensors helps monitor the structure's behaviour day and night. This repair program was scheduled to be completed in 2018.\n\nIn 2010, JCCBI \u2014 the Federal agency that oversees the structure \u2014 retained international engineering firm [[Delcan]] to carry out an expert study of the bridge's structural health. The firm returned a report entitled, \"The Future of the Champlain Bridge Crossing\". In the Executive Summary, the bridge was said to be \"functionally deficient\" for both current and long-term traffic demands, and showing \"significant deterioration\".<ref name=Delcan>{{cite web |url=http://www.pjcci.ca/Francais/champlain/Future%20of%20the%20Champlain%20Bridge%20Mar%2028%2011.pdf |title=Future of the Champlain Bridge Crossing |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-04-11 |publisher=pjcci.ca |author=Delcan, Inc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723164205/http://www.pjcci.ca/Francais/champlain/Future%20of%20the%20Champlain%20Bridge%20Mar%2028%2011.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}</ref> One finding suggested that the Champlain Bridge is in \"very much poorer condition than would be typical\" for comparable bridges. Delcan concluded that the bridge had \"many deficiencies\" and, even in light of the methodical inspection and rehabilitation of the structure undertaken by its owners, that continued operation \"entails some risks that cannot altogether be quantified\".\n\nThe [[CBC Television]] and [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada]], among other news agencies, have published segments highlighting concerns over conditions of surface roads in [[Montreal]] and the Champlain Bridge in particular.\n\nIn November 2013, a crack was discovered in a critical part of the superstructure. One lane was closed immediately and emergency repair plans were put in place. During preparation, the crack enlarged and a second lane was closed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pontchamplainbridge.ca/en/champlain-bridge-two-lanes-per-direction-next-weeks-support-beam-operation-underway/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202162455/http://www.pontchamplainbridge.ca/en/champlain-bridge-two-lanes-per-direction-next-weeks-support-beam-operation-underway/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}</ref>\n\nOn November 29, 2013, a temporary external beam of 75 tons, named \"super-beam\" by the media, was urgently installed to reinforce the structure. In June 2014, JCCBI replaced the super-beam with first modular truss that was designed and manufactured in Quebec.\n\nAs part of a 2014\u20132017 Edge girder reinforcement program, 94 modular trusses and six shoring systems were installed to stabilize the condition of the bridge girders.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[List of longest bridges in the world]]\n* [[List of bridges]]\n* [[List of crossings of the Saint Lawrence River#Quebec|List of crossings of the Saint Lawrence River]]\n* [[List of bridges in Montreal]]\n* [[Federal Bridge Corporation Limited]]\n* [[R\u00e9seau express m\u00e9tropolitain]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline|Champlain bridge}}\n*{{Official website|URL=http://jacquescartierchamplain.ca/?lang=en}}\n*[http://jacquescartierchamplain.ca/traffic-works/live-traffic/champlain-bridge/?lang=en Live Traffic \u2013 Champlain Bridge]\n*[http://www.newchamplain.ca/ New Champlain Bridge] | project website\n*[http://www.montrealroads.com/crossings/champlain/ Steve Anderson's MontrealRoads.com: Champlain Bridge (A-10, A-15, and A-20)]\n*{{Structurae|id=20002535|title=Champlain Bridge}}\n\n{{Crossings navbox\n|structure        = Bridges\n|place            = [[St. Lawrence River]]\n|bridge           = Champlain Bridge\n|bridge signs     = [[File:Quebec Autoroute 10.svg|25px]] [[File:Quebec Autoroute 15.svg|25px]] [[File:Quebec Autoroute 20.svg|25px]]\n|upstream         = [[Honor\u00e9 Mercier Bridge]]\n|upstream signs   = [[File:qc138.svg|25px]]\n|downstream       = [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]]\n|downstream signs = [[File:qc112.svg|25px]]\n}}\n\n{{Streets in Montreal}}\n{{Urban agglomeration of Longueuil}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Champlain Bridge, Montreal (1962-2019)}}\n[[Category:1962 establishments in Quebec]]\n[[Category:2019 disestablishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Cantilever bridges in Canada]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1962]]\n[[Category:Bridges in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Bridges over the Saint Lawrence River]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Brossard]]\n[[Category:Former toll bridges in Canada]]\n[[Category:Le Sud-Ouest]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Roads with a reversible lane]]\n[[Category:Transport in Brossard]]\n[[Category:Verdun, Quebec]]\n", "name_user": "ROBLOXGamingDavid", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champlain_Bridge,_Montreal_(1962%E2%80%932019)"}
