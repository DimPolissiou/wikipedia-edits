The player controls a researcher researching the local environment and nearby Alien Facility, on planet dubbed '4546B'.\n\n== Plot (Current Story) ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of [[Subnautica]]. Alterra has placed the Vesper Station into orbit around the planet 4546B for research. The Player is told to head to the nearby Mountain Alien Facility to locate Serik Jevov (Jeff). The player then encounters the voice of one of The Architects, letting the player know that Jeff is gone; the Alien Facility then gets locked off and requires a White Tablet to enter. The Alien Facility is then struck by a meteor and begins re-routing its power to Sanctuary. The player is told to get to the escape ship back at base, however, the ship takes off, and the player has to take shelter in Research Base Zero. After the meteor shower triggers an Avalanche, the ice breaks below the player causing them to have to swim out into open water, and head to a Lifepod launched by Sam Goodall on the Vesper Station, just before The Vesper is struck by a meteorite damaging its communication ability. \n\nShortly after, the player receives a message tracked to the Alien Sanctuary Site in the Twist Bridges. Once the player is exploring the Underwater Alien Facility, they are threatened by an Alien voice saying that its storage medium is failing. As the player reaches the inner of the Alien Facility, it notes that is has found an \"adequate storage medium\". The player offers their PDA for the consciousnesses to transfer into, however, it transfers into the players Cerebral Cortex. The Alien Voice then lets the player knows its name is Al-an.\n\nAs the player approaches Rocket Island, their PDA informs them that repairing the communications tower will reestablish contact with The Vesper, requiring the player to explore the Mercury II wreck, a ship that crashed anywhere from 30 to 100 years ago. After The Player repairs the communications tower, they are told the ship that took off at the beginning of the game crash-landed in the Glacial Basin and that they have three objectives: Find Jeff, extract a sample of the Kharaa sample and retrieve research data from Research Base Omega.\n\nIn the Glacial Basin, the player finds the crashed escape ship. The player can locate Jeff's base in the Glacial Basin and is informed that Jeff is most likely in another sector. The player is then told to head to the Leviathan Genetic Research Program to receive a sample of the Kharaa Bacterium and send it up to The Vesper. As the player explores the Glacial Basin, they find a Cache with one of The Architect body parts.  A while after the player sends the Kharaa Bacterium, they get a message saying that it never arrived. The player then gets a supply drop in the Lilypad Islands leading them towards Research Base Omega. Throughout the player's adventure, they find two more caches, each containing one of the other parts to The Architect's body. When the player arrives in the Fabricator Base, they are told that they are able to construct Al-an a body and transfer his consciousness back into it.\n\nThe Player gets contacted by Sam to be told that The Vesper's supply of Enzyme 42 deteriorated overnight and that they need a sample from a nearby Sea Emperor Leviathan. As the player sends the Enzyme up to The Vesper, an Architect shield covers the planet causing the rocket containing the cure to explode. The player then calls Robin and the Mission director about what happened, Jeff then joins the call and says his intention to hold the Vesper crew hostage as they are most likely exposed to the Kharaa bacterium, alongside The Player being trapped on the surface. The Player then learns from Al-an that they need to head to the Mountain Alien Facility \n\n'''From here on, the Story is not implemented, and won't be. Anything after the player enters the Alien Facility is not confirmed to have been the ending.''' \n\nAfter the player receives the White tablet to enter the facility, they head to the Alien Facility and enter it.  The game ends with The Vesper station being blown up.\n\n== Plot (New Story) ==\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of Subnautica. Alterra is funding a smaller company called XenoWorks, which the player works for. The player heads down on a shuttle to the surface of 4546B trying to \"cover from Alterra satellites\" to find their sister, Sam. On the way down, a meteor crashes into the player causing their lifepod to deploy and them to crash land in Sector Zero.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/ Official Website]\n\n{{uncategorised|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2019 video game}}\n{{Multiple issues|{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}{{Sources exist|date=April 2020}}{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2018}}\n\n'''''Subnautica Below Zero''''' is an [[open-world]] [[Survival game|survival]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed and published by [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]].\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' was first released in [[early access]] for Microsoft Windows and MacOS in January 2019, Unknown Worlds has developed a prequel to ''Subnautica Below Zero'', called ''[[Subnautica]]'' which was released fully in January 2018.\n\nThe current story is written by [[Tom Jubert]], with the new story being written by Jill Murray. {{Infobox video game\n| title = Subnautica Below Zero\n| image = \n| caption = \n| developer = [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]]\n| publisher = Unknown Worlds Entertainment\n| director = Charlie Cleveland\n| producer = \n| designer = \n| programmer = \n| artist = {{Unbulleted list|Cory Strader|Brian Cummings|Scott MacDonald\n<ref name=\"Crew\">{{cite web|last=Jeremy|first=Hugh|title=The Crew of Subnautica|url=http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/the-crew-of-subnautica/|publisher=[[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]]|date=December 17, 2013|access-date=April 9, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417144732/http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/the-crew-of-subnautica/|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n| writer = [[Tom Jubert]]\n| composer =\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[MacOS]]}}\n| released = \n| genre = {{hlist|[[Action-adventure game|Action-adventure]]|[[survival game|survival]]}}\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' is a [[Survival game|survival]], [[Adventure game|adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].

It began broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 1, 1997, in association with MediaNet (formerly TV Tokyo MediaNet and Softx) and Shopro, stands for [[Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions]] Co., Ltd. (formerly Shogakukan Productions Co., Ltd.). The show's central protagonist is [[Ash Ketchum]], a ten-year-old aspiring \"Pok\u00e9mon master\", who participates in competitions involving battles with creatures called [[List of Pok\u00e9mon|Pok\u00e9mon]] in the fictional regions of Kanto, the Orange Islands, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and recently Galar. Ash is usually joined by his electric mouse partner [[Pikachu]], and a regularly changing line-up of human friends. These friends are usually Pok\u00e9mon trainers, such as [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]], [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]], Tracey Sketchit, May, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Serena, Clemont, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, Sophocles, Go, and Koharu though some of the friends Ash has adventures with, such as May's brother Max, and Clemont's sister Bonnie, are too young to raise and train Pok\u00e9mon of their own, but Max & Bonnie promised that they will be Pok\u00e9mon trainers later in the future.\n\nRecurring antagonists of Ash and his friends throughout the show are the frequently comedic thieves from Team Rocket, made up of the humans Jessie and James, a talking [[Meowth]], and later, a Wobbuffet.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

During ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', he begins to travel through Sinnoh, where he meets and develops a rivalry with Ash Ketchum. Unlike Ash's previous rivals, Paul is a grumpy and serious trainer whose only concern towards Pok\u00e9mon is their ability to act in battle and who believes that forming bonds with Pok\u00e9mon dilutes their potential, and is thereby seen by many characters for being the complete opposite of Ash. His harsh training style, competitive behavior, and desire to be strong derives from his resentment toward his older brother, Reggie, who had been an accomplished trainer until he lost to Pyramid King Brandon, causing him to quit Pok\u00e9mon training to become a breeder. Paul is determined to make sure he doesn't meet that same fate, so he plans to surpass not just any trainer, but his own brother as well, although he is clearly unlikable to many. In Japan, he is named after [[Shinji Mikami]], the creator of the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. He ultimately loses his battle against Ash in the Sinnoh League. Afterwards, he finds a bit of respect for Ash, and heads out to battle with Brandon. Ash and Paul depart on a good note. Ash wishes him luck, which Paul returns. Just as Paul is about to leave Ash calls out that they should battle again, real soon. Then he smiles, finally accepting him. As he waves good-bye, he walks away, into the sunset.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James.

The show's central protagonist is [[Ash Ketchum]], a ten-year-old aspiring \"Pok\u00e9mon master\", who participates in competitions involving battles with creatures called [[List of Pok\u00e9mon|Pok\u00e9mon]] in the fictional regions of Kanto, the Orange Islands, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and recently Galar. Ash is usually joined by his electric mouse partner [[Pikachu]], and a regularly changing line-up of human friends. These friends are usually Pok\u00e9mon trainers, such as [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]], [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]], Tracey Sketchit, May, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Serena, Clemont, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, Sophocles, Go, and Koharu though some of the friends Ash has adventures with, such as May's brother Max, and Clemont's sister Bonnie, are too young to raise and train Pok\u00e9mon of their own, but Max & Bonnie promised that they will be Pok\u00e9mon trainers later in the future.\n\nRecurring antagonists of Ash and his friends throughout the show are the frequently comedic thieves from Team Rocket, made up of the humans Jessie and James, a talking [[Meowth]], and later, a Wobbuffet.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

During ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', he begins to travel through Sinnoh, where he meets and develops a rivalry with Ash Ketchum. Unlike Ash's previous rivals, Paul is a grumpy and serious trainer whose only concern towards Pok\u00e9mon is their ability to act in battle and who believes that forming bonds with Pok\u00e9mon dilutes their potential, and is thereby seen by many characters for being the complete opposite of Ash. His harsh training style, competitive behavior, and desire to be strong derives from his resentment toward his older brother, Reggie, who had been an accomplished trainer until he lost to Pyramid King Brandon, causing him to quit Pok\u00e9mon training to become a breeder. Paul is determined to make sure he doesn't meet that same fate, so he plans to surpass not just any trainer, but his own brother as well, although he is clearly unlikable to many. In Japan, he is named after [[Shinji Mikami]], the creator of the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. He ultimately loses his battle against Ash in the Sinnoh League. Afterwards, he finds a bit of respect for Ash, and heads out to battle with Brandon. Ash and Paul depart on a good note. Ash wishes him luck, which Paul returns. Just as Paul is about to leave Ash calls out that they should battle again, real soon. Then he smiles, finally accepting him. As he waves good-bye, he walks away, into the sunset.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James.

The film follows a haunted red dress as it torments various owners. It stars [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]], [[Hayley Squires]], [[Leo Bill]], and [[Gwendoline Christie]]. \n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019 by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] and was released in the United States on 6 December 2019 by [[A24 (company)|A24]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSheila (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is a recently divorced bank teller who lives with her son Vince (Jaygann Ayeh). She is frequently chastised for insignificant work errors by her bosses Stash (Julian Barratt) and Clive (Steve Oram), and intimidated by Vince's new girlfriend Gwen (Gwendoline Christie). She visits department store Dentley and Soper's to buy a dress for an upcoming date in the sales. After meeting the enigmatic store clerk Miss Luckmoore (Fatma Mohamed), Sheila is drawn to a beautiful, flowing red dress which she tries on. Luckmoore convinces Sheila to purchase it. \n\nSheila notices a strange rash on her chest after wearing the dress. After putting the dress in the washing machine, the machine breaks down and Sheila injures her hand in the process. Sheila returns to the store to get a new size for the dress only to learn that there is only one version of the dress and that the store model was killed after wearing the dress for the store catalog. Sheila goes on a date with new suitor Zach (Barry Adamson) while Gwen and Vince have sex. As she climaxes, Gwen is almost killed when the dress floats above her and tries to suffocate her.  Sheila and Zach go for a walk together, where Sheila is attacked by an Alsatian, which cuts her leg and rips the dress in the process. Later that day, Vince returns home with the dress which is somehow now fully repaired. After hearing the dress move about in the wardrobe at night, an unsettled Sheila attempts to return the dress to the store but is refused by Luckmoore. Sheila is then killed in a car accident as she is driving en route to spending the night with Zach. \n\nThe dress comes into possession of washing machine repairman Reg Speaks (Leo Bill) who is made by his friends to wear it on a night out. He is engaged to Babs (Hayley Squires), who takes a liking to the dress and decides to wear it as well. Reg returns home and is hypnotised by the department store's TV advertisement while Babs is at the store shopping. Luckmoore is alarmed to see Babs is wearing the dress and demands she leaves. Meanwhile, Reg dies from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the dress manipulating the boiler. Babs recalls to Luckmoore a dream she had about her being the model for all the dresses in the catalogue but getting thinner and thinner as the dresses got larger and larger. She was then buried in the store by the workers. Babs goes to try on a dress while a fight soon breaks out in the store that quickly spirals into looting. \n\nThe dress catches fire and the flames spread quickly around the store. Babs burns to death, unable to escape her changing room, while Luckmoore flees down into the dumbwaiter with a dismembered mannequin. As she descends deeper into the store, she sees the dead store model, Sheila, Reg, and Babs stitching together the dress from threads made of their blood; they are trapped in eternal servitude. A fireman observes the destroyed store and discovers the dress undamaged amongst the rubble.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Sheila\n* [[Hayley Squires]] as Babs\n* [[Leo Bill]] as Reg Speaks\n* [[Gwendoline Christie]] as Gwen\n* [[Julian Barratt]] as Stash\n* [[Steve Oram]] as Clive\n* [[Barry Adamson]] as Zach\n* Jaygann Ayeh as Vince\n* [[Richard Bremmer]] as Mr. Lundy\n* Terry Bird as Bananas Brian\n* Fatma Mohamed as Miss Luckmoore\n* [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Jill\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2017, it was announced [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] had joined the cast of the film, with [[Peter Strickland (director)|Peter Strickland]] directing from a screenplay he wrote.

He wanted to interrogate the reactions people have to clothing. The dress itself was therefore very important. It also needed to fit a range of body types, so costume designer Jo Thompson made a simple red silk [[wrap dress]].<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last1=Kelley |first1=Sonaiya |title=In Peter Strickland's gleefully demented 'In Fabric,' an upscale department store serves as a shop of horrors |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-12-06/in-fabric-peter-strickland-gwendoline-christie-marianne-jean-baptiste |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=6 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nIn March 2018, [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] acquired U.K. distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/peter-stricklands-in-fabric-lands-uk-deal-exclusive/5127488.article|title=Peter Strickland's 'In Fabric' lands UK deal (exclusive)|website=Screen International|first=Tom|last=Grater|date=15 March 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104211212/https://www.screendaily.com/news/peter-stricklands-in-fabric-lands-uk-deal-exclusive/5127488.article|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/tiff/in-fabric/|title=In Fabric|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104211112/https://www.tiff.net/tiff/in-fabric/|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Shortly after, [[A24 (company)|A24]] acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/in-fabric-sold-a24-1202947075/|title=A24 Buys Horror-Thriller 'In Fabric' for North America|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=18 September 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213070558/https://variety.com/2018/film/news/in-fabric-sold-a24-1202947075/|archive-date=13 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule|title=In Fabric|website=Launching Films|accessdate=April 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405173159/https://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule|archive-date=April 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released in the United States on 6 December 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://a24films.com/films/in-fabric|title=In Fabric|publisher=[[A24 (company)|A24]]|accessdate=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828085549/https://a24films.com/films/in-fabric|archive-date=August 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''In Fabric'' received universal acclaim from film critics.

The film follows a haunted red dress as it torments various owners. It stars [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]], [[Hayley Squires]], [[Leo Bill]], and [[Gwendoline Christie]]. \n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019 by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] and was released in the United States on 6 December 2019 by [[A24 (company)|A24]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSheila (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is a recently divorced bank teller who lives with her son Vince (Jaygann Ayeh). She is frequently chastised for insignificant work errors by her bosses Stash (Julian Barratt) and Clive (Steve Oram), and intimidated by Vince's new girlfriend Gwen (Gwendoline Christie). She visits department store Dentley and Soper's to buy a dress for an upcoming date in the sales. After meeting the enigmatic store clerk Miss Luckmoore (Fatma Mohamed), Sheila is drawn to a beautiful, flowing red dress which she tries on. Luckmoore convinces Sheila to purchase it. \n\nSheila notices a strange rash on her chest after wearing the dress. After putting the dress in the washing machine, the machine breaks down and Sheila injures her hand in the process. Sheila returns to the store to get a new size for the dress only to learn that there is only one version of the dress and that the store model was killed after wearing the dress for the store catalog. Sheila goes on a date with new suitor Zach (Barry Adamson) while Gwen and Vince have sex. As she climaxes, Gwen is almost killed when the dress floats above her and tries to suffocate her.  Sheila and Zach go for a walk together, where Sheila is attacked by an Alsatian, which cuts her leg and rips the dress in the process. Later that day, Vince returns home with the dress which is somehow now fully repaired. After hearing the dress move about in the wardrobe at night, an unsettled Sheila attempts to return the dress to the store but is refused by Luckmoore. Sheila is then killed in a car accident as she is driving en route to spending the night with Zach. \n\nThe dress comes into possession of washing machine repairman Reg Speaks (Leo Bill) who is made by his friends to wear it on a night out. He is engaged to Babs (Hayley Squires), who takes a liking to the dress and decides to wear it as well. Reg returns home and is hypnotised by the department store's TV advertisement while Babs is at the store shopping. Luckmoore is alarmed to see Babs is wearing the dress and demands she leaves. Meanwhile, Reg dies from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the dress manipulating the boiler. Babs recalls to Luckmoore a dream she had about her being the model for all the dresses in the catalogue but getting thinner and thinner as the dresses got larger and larger. She was then buried in the store by the workers. Babs goes to try on a dress while a fight soon breaks out in the store that quickly spirals into looting. \n\nThe dress catches fire and the flames spread quickly around the store. Babs burns to death, unable to escape her changing room, while Luckmoore flees down into the dumbwaiter with a dismembered mannequin. As she descends deeper into the store, she sees the dead store model, Sheila, Reg, and Babs stitching together the dress from threads made of their blood; they are trapped in eternal servitude. A fireman observes the destroyed store and discovers the dress undamaged amongst the rubble.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Sheila\n* [[Hayley Squires]] as Babs\n* [[Leo Bill]] as Reg Speaks\n* [[Gwendoline Christie]] as Gwen\n* [[Julian Barratt]] as Stash\n* [[Steve Oram]] as Clive\n* [[Barry Adamson]] as Zach\n* Jaygann Ayeh as Vince\n* [[Richard Bremmer]] as Mr. Lundy\n* Terry Bird as Bananas Brian\n* Fatma Mohamed as Miss Luckmoore\n* [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Jill\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2017, it was announced [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] had joined the cast of the film, with [[Peter Strickland (director)|Peter Strickland]] directing from a screenplay he wrote.

He wanted to interrogate the reactions people have to clothing. The dress itself was therefore very important. It also needed to fit a range of body types, so costume designer Jo Thompson made a simple red silk [[wrap dress]].<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last1=Kelley |first1=Sonaiya |title=In Peter Strickland's gleefully demented 'In Fabric,' an upscale department store serves as a shop of horrors |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-12-06/in-fabric-peter-strickland-gwendoline-christie-marianne-jean-baptiste |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=6 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nIn March 2018, [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] acquired U.K. distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/peter-stricklands-in-fabric-lands-uk-deal-exclusive/5127488.article|title=Peter Strickland's 'In Fabric' lands UK deal (exclusive)|website=Screen International|first=Tom|last=Grater|date=15 March 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104211212/https://www.screendaily.com/news/peter-stricklands-in-fabric-lands-uk-deal-exclusive/5127488.article|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/tiff/in-fabric/|title=In Fabric|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104211112/https://www.tiff.net/tiff/in-fabric/|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Shortly after, [[A24 (company)|A24]] acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/in-fabric-sold-a24-1202947075/|title=A24 Buys Horror-Thriller 'In Fabric' for North America|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=18 September 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213070558/https://variety.com/2018/film/news/in-fabric-sold-a24-1202947075/|archive-date=13 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule|title=In Fabric|website=Launching Films|accessdate=April 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405173159/https://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule|archive-date=April 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released in the United States on 6 December 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://a24films.com/films/in-fabric|title=In Fabric|publisher=[[A24 (company)|A24]]|accessdate=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828085549/https://a24films.com/films/in-fabric|archive-date=August 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''In Fabric'' received universal acclaim from film critics.
