But abolitionists emphasized the sinfulness of individual owners, which Lincoln never did. He even married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|the daughter of a slaveowner from Kentucky]] and sometimes his family stayed with his father-in-law. He wanted states to purchase all the slaves and set them free.{{cn|date=January 2020}} He supported voluntary colonization out of the country until mid-1863, when he began to see the need for black soldiers in America.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nStarting in 1831, with the publication of [[Wm. Lloyd Garrison]]'s [[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]] newspaper, a growing group of abolitionists called for total, immediate abolition of slavery (\"inmediatism\"). Lincoln never called for this, and focused instead on the less politically challenging goal of preventing the creation of new slave states, and specifically blocking the expansion of slavery into the new Western territories. Lincoln's activism on that issue started in reaction to the 1854 [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], designed by his great rival [[Stephen A. Douglas]], a senator from Illinois. The Act reversed anti-slavery laws and allowed the settlers to decide on slavery in their territory.  Lincoln worried that the extension of slavery into new western lands could block free labor on free soil when rich slave owners bought up all the best lands.\n\nLincoln, with partial compensation to owners, did [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|end slavery in the District of Columbia]] in 1862; this abolitionist goal for decades became possible with the departure of the Southern members of Congress at the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. During 1861-62 Lincoln tried unsuccessfully to get the loyal [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Kentucky and Maryland to do likewise. He repeatedly stated that his goal was the preservation of the Union, not ending slavery in the states where it existed.\n\nIn a highly significant shift, Lincoln used his role as commander-in-chief to issue the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], effective On January 1, 1863. Under guise of a military measure, it made all slaves in Confederate areas forever free under U.S. law as soon as the U.S. Army reached them \u2014 and they reached all of them by June 1865. On its first day, the proclamation freed tens of thousands of slaves. Week by week as the Union army advanced, slaves were liberated. The last were freed in Texas on \"[[Juneteenth]]\" (June 19, 1865).<ref>Randolph B. Campbell, \"The End of Slavery in Texas\" ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 88.1 (1984): 71-80.</ref>  Final abolition in the border states was achieved later that year, with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which Lincoln vigorously promoted. therefore president liccoln wanted to ablosh slavery\n\n\n==Early years==\nLincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, [[Kentucky]].<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 20\u201322.</ref> His family attended a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had strict moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 22\u201324.</ref>  The family, moved north across the [[Ohio River]] to Indiana, where slavery was not allowed, and made a new start in then Perry County; now [[Spencer County, Indiana]].

His plan was to halt the spread of slavery, and to offer monetary compensation to slave-owners in states that agreed to end slavery (see [[Compensated emancipation]]).

Crofts, ''Lincoln and the Politics of Slavery: The Other Thirteenth Amendment and the Struggle to Save the Union'' (2016).</ref>\n\n===Building a demand for emancipation===\nLincoln's long-term goal was to apply federal pressure on the slave states to get them to abolish slavery on their own, beginning with the four loyal, non-seceding [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri.  But he also warned that if the slave states seceded from the Union they would forfeit the constitutional protection of slavery, including any claim to the recovery of their fugitive slaves.\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] began in April, 1861, and by the end of May the Lincoln administration approved a policy of not returning fugitive slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states.  Such slaves were deemed \"contraband of war,\" or \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]]s.\" On August 6, 1861, Congress declared the forfeiture of contraband to be permanent, and two days later Lincoln's War Department issued instructions emancipating all the slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states or owners.  By the end of the year thousands of slaves were being emancipated.\n\nSo as not to alienate the border states, Lincoln was careful to ensure that his generals followed the letter of the law.  He encouraged General James K. Lane in western Missouri to emancipate thousands of slaves of disloyal masters who came voluntarily within his lines.  But in eastern Missouri, when General [[John C. Fremont]] issued a decree emancipating the slaves of disloyal owners in areas the Union did not control, Lincoln ordered the general to revise his decree to conform with the law.  Lincoln promoted Lane to Brigadier General, but would later fire Fremont for corruption and military incompetence. In western Missouri Lincoln replaced Fremont with an abolitionist general, [[David Hunter]].  The care Lincoln took to distinguish legal from extra-legal emancipation was reaffirmed in May, 1862, when Hunter issued two emancipation proclamations from the area his troops recently occupied off the coast of Georgia. The first proclamation, which was legal, freed all the slaves who came within his lines. The second proclamation freed all the slaves in states, most of them beyond the reach of the Union Army. That second proclamation, like Fremont's, went beyond the law and Lincoln once again reversed it.\n\nBy the end of 1861 tens of thousands of slaves were emancipated as they came into Union lines at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, the Sea Islands off South Carolina, and in western Missouri.  In December the Lincoln administration announced its emancipation policy in a series of annual reports by the president as well as several of his cabinet secretaries.  By January Lincoln himself declared that no federal authority, civil or military, could legally return fugitive slaves to their owners.<ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-0-87249-400-8 |title=Lincoln and Black Freedom: A Study in Presidential Leadership |author-link=LaWanda Cox |last=Cox |first=LaWanda |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lincolnblackfree00coxl/page/12 12\u201314] |publisher=[[University of South Carolina]] Press |date=1981 |url=https://archive.org/details/lincolnblackfree00coxl/page/12 }}</ref>  By then the sentiment for a more radical approach to emancipation had been building, and in July Congress authorized the president to issue a more general emancipation proclamation, freeing all the slaves in all areas in rebellion.  A few days after Lincoln signed the law\u2014known as the Second Confiscation Act\u2014he drafted the first version of what would become his Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nBecause the Constitution could sanction emancipation only as one of the war powers, freeing slaves could only be justified as a means of winning the war and suppressing the Southern rebellion.  As a result, until the very end of the war Lincoln claimed that the purpose of the war was the restoration of the Union.  Southern leaders denounced Lincoln as a bloodthirsty revolutionary whose emancipation policies proved that the secessionists were right all along about those they labeled \"Black Republicans.\" Northern Democrats, meanwhile, denied that emancipation was a \"military necessity,\" as Lincoln and the Republicans claimed it was. But Lincoln never deviated from his official position, that because the Constitution recognized slavery in the states the only constitutional justification for freeing slaves was the restoration of the Union.\n\n===Letter to Greeley ===\nOn August 22, 1862 Lincoln published a letter in response to an editorial by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', in which the editor asked why Lincoln had not yet issued an emancipation proclamation, as he was authorized to do by the Second Confiscation Act.  In his reply Lincoln differentiated between \"my view of official duty\" \u2014 that is, what he can do in his official capacity as President \u2014 and his personal views. Officially he must save the Union above all else; personally he wanted to free all the slaves:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lincoln |first1=Abraham |author-link=Abraham Lincoln |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln |chapter-url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln/Volume_9/Greeley,_Horace#1862-08-22 |title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Marion Mills |chapter=Letter to Horace Greeley, August 22, 1862 |publisher=Current Literature |access-date=January 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|1=\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be \"the Union as it was.\" If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.

Lincoln scholar [[Harold Holzer]] wrote in this context about Lincoln's letter: \"Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.\"<ref>Harold Holzer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA4lXY3W8hkC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President]'', Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 162</ref> Historian Richard Striner argues that \"for years\" Lincoln's letter has been misread as \"Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.\"<ref name=\"Striner\">{{cite book|last=Striner|first=Richard|title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/fatherabrahamlin0000stri/page/176 176]|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1|url=https://archive.org/details/fatherabrahamlin0000stri/page/176}}</ref> However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time.<ref name=\"Striner\"/> In his 2014 book, ''[[Lincoln's Gamble]]'', journalist and historian [[Todd Brewster]] asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war\u2014not as the mission itself.<ref name=\"Brewster\">{{cite book |last=Brewster |first=Todd |title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |page=59 |isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref> But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, [[Edward Bates]], for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brewster |first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |page=236 |isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref>\n\nBut a constitutional amendment has to be ratified by three-fourths of the states.  There were too many slave states and not enough free states for a constitutional amendment to be ratified, so even as he was preparing to issue his Emancipation Proclamation he proposed a series of constitutional amendments that would make it easier for the federal government to pressure states to abolish slavery on their own, including compensation, a gradual timetable for abolition, and subsidies for blacks willing to colonize themselves outside the United States.  None of those constitutional amendments came close to passage.  But by 1863 Lincoln had other ways of pressuring the state to abolish slavery:  By refusing to return slaves who escaped from loyal masters in loyal states, and by enlisting slaves from loyal states into the Union Army with the promise of emancipation, the Lincoln administration systematically undermined slavery in many of the southern states.\n\nLincoln had begun pressuring the Border States to abolish slavery in November, 1861, with no success.  In 1862 he began to warn the states that if they did not abolish slavery on their own, the institution would succumb to the \"incidents of war\" and would be undermined by \"mere friction and abrasion.\"  But the abrasive was no mere incident; it was the policy of emancipation.  Beginning in mid-1863 Lincoln intensified the pressure on all the slave states, and in early 1864 the policy began to pay off.  Between January, 1864, and January, 1865, seven slave states abolished slavery, all under intense pressure from the federal government.  By the time the House of Representatives sent the Thirteenth Amendment to the states for ratification the ratio of free to slave states was 27:  9, or three-quarters.\n\n===Conkling letter===\nLincoln came to appreciate the role that black troops played in this process.  In the end some 180,000 blacks served in the Union Army, a disproportionate number of them from the states that ended up abolishing slavery.  He made his feeling clear in an eloquent letter a year later to [[James C. Conkling]] in August 26, 1863.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, \"Defending emancipation: Abraham Lincoln and the Conkling letter, 1863.\" ''Civil War History'' 48#4 (2002), p. 313+.

I know, as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes believe the emancipation policy and the use of the colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the Rebellion, and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with the Republican party policies but who held them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith.\n\nYou say you will not fight to free Negroes. Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but, no matter. Fight you, then exclusively to save the Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time, then, for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes.\n\nI thought that in your struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently? I thought that whatever Negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do, in saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But Negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do any thing for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive\u2014even the promise of freedom. And the promise being made, must be kept....[When peace comes] then, there will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation; while, I fear, there will be some white ones, unable to forget that, with malignant heart, and deceitful speech, they strove to hinder it.\n}}\n\nThe timing of the Conkling letter came in August 1863, the month after two great Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, but also at a time when Americans were reading the first reports of black troops fighting courageously in battles at Milliken's Bend and Battery Wagner.  It was also in the summer of 1863 that Lincoln initiated his intensified effort to get various slave states to abolish slavery on their own.\n\nLincoln addresses the changes to his positions and actions regarding emancipation in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm |title=1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges}}</ref><ref>Cuomo and Holzer, ''Lincoln on Democracy'', 1990, \"If Slavery is not wrong, nothing is Wrong\", pp. 316\u2013318</ref> In that letter, Lincoln states his ethical opposition to slavery, writing, \"I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.\" Lincoln further explained that he had eventually determined that military emancipation and the enlistment of black soldiers were necessary for the preservation of the Union, which was his responsibility as President.\n\nHaving won re-election to the presidency in November 1864 on a platform of abolishing slavery, Lincoln and several members of his cabinet embarked on a sustained lobbying effort to get the abolition amendment through the House of Representatives.  The amendment abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States was ratified by every state that had abolished slavery during the war, and it became part of the Constitution in December, 1865.\n\n===Reconstruction===\nIn December 1863, Lincoln used his war powers and issued a \"[[Ten percent plan|Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction]]\", which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 47.</ref>\n\n===Thirteenth Amendment===\nWhen Lincoln accepted the nomination for the Union party for President in June, 1864, he called for the first time for the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], to immediately abolish slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. He wrote in his letter of acceptance that \"it would make a fitting and necessary conclusion\" to the war and would permanently join the causes of \"Liberty and Union.\" He won re-election on this platform in November, and in December, 1864, Lincoln worked to have the House approve the amendment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Foner |first=Eric |title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |publisher=W.W.

On July 12, 1862 President Lincoln, in a conference with Congressmen from Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri, encouraged their respective states to adopt emancipation legislation that gave compensation to the slave owners. On July 14, 1862 President Lincoln sent a bill to Congress that allowed the Treasury to issue bonds at 6% interest to states for slave emancipation compensation to the slave owners.

If rejected, then it appears that Lincoln \"sloughed off\" colonization at some point in mid-1864. If it is accepted, then Lincoln remained a colonizationist at the time of his death. This question is compounded by the unclear meaning of Hay's diary, and another article by Secretary of the Navy [[Gideon Welles]], which suggests that Lincoln intended to revive colonization in his second term.

Without this primary and essential condition to success his efforts must have been vain and utterly fruitless. Had he put the abolition of slavery before the salvation of the Union, he would have inevitably driven from him a powerful class of the American people and rendered resistance to rebellion impossible.\n\nViewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull, and indifferent; but measuring him by the sentiment of his country, a sentiment he was bound as a statesman to consult, he was swift, zealous, radical, and determined\u2026\n\nTaking him for all in all, measuring the tremendous magnitude of the work before him, considering the necessary means to ends, and surveying the end from the beginning, infinite wisdom has seldom sent any man into the world better fitted for his mission than Abraham Lincoln.\n}}\n\nIn his past, Lincoln lived in a middle-class, racially mixed neighborhood of [[Springfield, Illinois]]; one of his long-time neighbors, Jameson Jenkins (who may have been born a slave), had come from North Carolina and was publicly implicated in the 1850s as a Springfield conductor on the [[underground railroad]], sheltering escaped slaves.

But abolitionists emphasized the sinfulness of individual owners, which Lincoln never did. He even married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|the daughter of a slaveowner from Kentucky]] and sometimes his family stayed with his father-in-law. He wanted states to purchase all the slaves and set them free.{{cn|date=January 2020}} He supported voluntary colonization out of the country until mid-1863, when he began to see the need for black soldiers in America.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nStarting in 1831, with the publication of [[Wm. Lloyd Garrison]]'s [[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]] newspaper, a growing group of abolitionists called for total, immediate abolition of slavery (\"inmediatism\"). Lincoln never called for this, and focused instead on the less politically challenging goal of preventing the creation of new slave states, and specifically blocking the expansion of slavery into the new Western territories. Lincoln's activism on that issue started in reaction to the 1854 [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], designed by his great rival [[Stephen A. Douglas]], a senator from Illinois. The Act reversed anti-slavery laws and allowed the settlers to decide on slavery in their territory.  Lincoln worried that the extension of slavery into new western lands could block free labor on free soil when rich slave owners bought up all the best lands.\n\nLincoln, with partial compensation to owners, did [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|end slavery in the District of Columbia]] in 1862; this abolitionist goal for decades became possible with the departure of the Southern members of Congress at the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. During 1861-62 Lincoln tried unsuccessfully to get the loyal [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Kentucky and Maryland to do likewise. He repeatedly stated that his goal was the preservation of the Union, not ending slavery in the states where it existed.\n\nIn a highly significant shift, Lincoln used his role as commander-in-chief to issue the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], effective On January 1, 1863. Under guise of a military measure, it made all slaves in Confederate areas forever free under U.S. law as soon as the U.S. Army reached them \u2014 and they reached all of them by June 1865. On its first day, the proclamation freed tens of thousands of slaves. Week by week as the Union army advanced, slaves were liberated. The last were freed in Texas on \"[[Juneteenth]]\" (June 19, 1865).<ref>Randolph B. Campbell, \"The End of Slavery in Texas\" ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 88.1 (1984): 71-80.</ref>  Final abolition in the border states was achieved later that year, with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which Lincoln vigorously promoted.\n\n==Early years==\nLincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, [[Kentucky]].<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 20\u201322.</ref> His family attended a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had strict moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 22\u201324.</ref>  The family, moved north across the [[Ohio River]] to Indiana, where slavery was not allowed, and made a new start in then Perry County; now [[Spencer County, Indiana]].

The debate before 1860 was mainly focused on the Western territories, especially Kansas and the [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] controversy.\n\nLincoln was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in the [[1860 United States presidential election|election of 1860]]. Lincoln was opposed to the expansion of slavery into new areas, but agreed with nearly all Americans, including most radical abolitionists, that the federal government was prevented by the Constitution from abolishing slavery in states where it already existed. His plan was to halt the spread of slavery, and to offer monetary compensation to slave-owners in states that agreed to end slavery (see [[Compensated emancipation]]). He was considered a moderate within a Republican party that, nevertheless, took the radical position that slavery should be put on a course of \"ultimate extinction\" with the help of the federal government.\n\n==As President-elect in 1860 and 1861==\nIn a letter to Senator Lyman Trumbull on December 10, 1860, Lincoln wrote, \"Let there be no compromise on the question of extending slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuomo |first1=Mario M. |last2=Holzer |first2=Harold |publisher=Harper Collins |date=1990 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lincolnondemocra0000linc/page/180 180] |isbn=0-06-039126-X |title=Lincoln on Democracy |url=https://archive.org/details/lincolnondemocra0000linc/page/180 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4/1:231?rgn=div1;view=fulltext |title=To Lyman Trumbull |last=Lincoln |first=Abraham |date=December 10, 1860 |via=''The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'', [[University of Michigan]] Library |access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> In a letter to [[John A.

Crofts, ''Lincoln and the Politics of Slavery: The Other Thirteenth Amendment and the Struggle to Save the Union'' (2016).</ref>\n\n===Building a demand for emancipation===\nLincoln's long-term goal was to apply federal pressure on the slave states to get them to abolish slavery on their own, beginning with the four loyal, non-seceding [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri.  But he also warned that if the slave states seceded from the Union they would forfeit the constitutional protection of slavery, including any claim to the recovery of their fugitive slaves.\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] began in April, 1861, and by the end of May the Lincoln administration approved a policy of not returning fugitive slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states.  Such slaves were deemed \"contraband of war,\" or \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]]s.\" On August 6, 1861, Congress declared the forfeiture of contraband to be permanent, and two days later Lincoln's War Department issued instructions emancipating all the slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states or owners.  By the end of the year thousands of slaves were being emancipated.\n\nSo as not to alienate the border states, Lincoln was careful to ensure that his generals followed the letter of the law.  He encouraged General James K. Lane in western Missouri to emancipate thousands of slaves of disloyal masters who came voluntarily within his lines.  But in eastern Missouri, when General [[John C. Fremont]] issued a decree emancipating the slaves of disloyal owners in areas the Union did not control, Lincoln ordered the general to revise his decree to conform with the law.  Lincoln promoted Lane to Brigadier General, but would later fire Fremont for corruption and military incompetence. In western Missouri Lincoln replaced Fremont with an abolitionist general, [[David Hunter]].  The care Lincoln took to distinguish legal from extra-legal emancipation was reaffirmed in May, 1862, when Hunter issued two emancipation proclamations from the area his troops recently occupied off the coast of Georgia. The first proclamation, which was legal, freed all the slaves who came within his lines. The second proclamation freed all the slaves in states, most of them beyond the reach of the Union Army. That second proclamation, like Fremont's, went beyond the law and Lincoln once again reversed it.\n\nBy the end of 1861 tens of thousands of slaves were emancipated as they came into Union lines at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, the Sea Islands off South Carolina, and in western Missouri.  In December the Lincoln administration announced its emancipation policy in a series of annual reports by the president as well as several of his cabinet secretaries.  By January Lincoln himself declared that no federal authority, civil or military, could legally return fugitive slaves to their owners.<ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-0-87249-400-8 |title=Lincoln and Black Freedom: A Study in Presidential Leadership |author-link=LaWanda Cox |last=Cox |first=LaWanda |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lincolnblackfree00coxl/page/12 12\u201314] |publisher=[[University of South Carolina]] Press |date=1981 |url=https://archive.org/details/lincolnblackfree00coxl/page/12 }}</ref>  By then the sentiment for a more radical approach to emancipation had been building, and in July Congress authorized the president to issue a more general emancipation proclamation, freeing all the slaves in all areas in rebellion.  A few days after Lincoln signed the law\u2014known as the Second Confiscation Act\u2014he drafted the first version of what would become his Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nBecause the Constitution could sanction emancipation only as one of the war powers, freeing slaves could only be justified as a means of winning the war and suppressing the Southern rebellion.  As a result, until the very end of the war Lincoln claimed that the purpose of the war was the restoration of the Union.  Southern leaders denounced Lincoln as a bloodthirsty revolutionary whose emancipation policies proved that the secessionists were right all along about those they labeled \"Black Republicans.\" Northern Democrats, meanwhile, denied that emancipation was a \"military necessity,\" as Lincoln and the Republicans claimed it was. But Lincoln never deviated from his official position, that because the Constitution recognized slavery in the states the only constitutional justification for freeing slaves was the restoration of the Union.\n\n===Letter to Greeley ===\nOn August 22, 1862 Lincoln published a letter in response to an editorial by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', in which the editor asked why Lincoln had not yet issued an emancipation proclamation, as he was authorized to do by the Second Confiscation Act.  In his reply Lincoln differentiated between \"my view of official duty\" \u2014 that is, what he can do in his official capacity as President \u2014 and his personal views. Officially he must save the Union above all else; personally he wanted to free all the slaves:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lincoln |first1=Abraham |author-link=Abraham Lincoln |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln |chapter-url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln/Volume_9/Greeley,_Horace#1862-08-22 |title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Marion Mills |chapter=Letter to Horace Greeley, August 22, 1862 |publisher=Current Literature |access-date=January 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|1=\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be \"the Union as it was.\" If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.\n\nI have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.\n}}\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{further|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n[[File:Emancipation Proclamation - LOC 04067 - restoration1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|1864 Reproduction of Emancipation Proclamation]]\n\nJust one month after writing this letter, Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which announced that at the beginning of 1863, he would use his war powers to free all slaves in states still in rebellion as they came under Union control. Lincoln scholar [[Harold Holzer]] wrote in this context about Lincoln's letter: \"Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.\"<ref>Harold Holzer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA4lXY3W8hkC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President]'', Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 162</ref> Historian Richard Striner argues that \"for years\" Lincoln's letter has been misread as \"Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.\"<ref name=\"Striner\">{{cite book|last=Striner|first=Richard|title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/fatherabrahamlin0000stri/page/176 176]|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1|url=https://archive.org/details/fatherabrahamlin0000stri/page/176}}</ref> However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time.<ref name=\"Striner\"/> In his 2014 book, ''[[Lincoln's Gamble]]'', journalist and historian [[Todd Brewster]] asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war\u2014not as the mission itself.<ref name=\"Brewster\">{{cite book |last=Brewster |first=Todd |title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |page=59 |isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref> But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, [[Edward Bates]], for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brewster |first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |page=236 |isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref>\n\nBut a constitutional amendment has to be ratified by three-fourths of the states.  There were too many slave states and not enough free states for a constitutional amendment to be ratified, so even as he was preparing to issue his Emancipation Proclamation he proposed a series of constitutional amendments that would make it easier for the federal government to pressure states to abolish slavery on their own, including compensation, a gradual timetable for abolition, and subsidies for blacks willing to colonize themselves outside the United States.  None of those constitutional amendments came close to passage.  But by 1863 Lincoln had other ways of pressuring the state to abolish slavery:  By refusing to return slaves who escaped from loyal masters in loyal states, and by enlisting slaves from loyal states into the Union Army with the promise of emancipation, the Lincoln administration systematically undermined slavery in many of the southern states.\n\nLincoln had begun pressuring the Border States to abolish slavery in November, 1861, with no success.  In 1862 he began to warn the states that if they did not abolish slavery on their own, the institution would succumb to the \"incidents of war\" and would be undermined by \"mere friction and abrasion.\"  But the abrasive was no mere incident; it was the policy of emancipation.  Beginning in mid-1863 Lincoln intensified the pressure on all the slave states, and in early 1864 the policy began to pay off.  Between January, 1864, and January, 1865, seven slave states abolished slavery, all under intense pressure from the federal government.  By the time the House of Representatives sent the Thirteenth Amendment to the states for ratification the ratio of free to slave states was 27:  9, or three-quarters.\n\n===Conkling letter===\nLincoln came to appreciate the role that black troops played in this process.  In the end some 180,000 blacks served in the Union Army, a disproportionate number of them from the states that ended up abolishing slavery.

I know, as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes believe the emancipation policy and the use of the colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the Rebellion, and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with the Republican party policies but who held them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith.\n\nYou say you will not fight to free Negroes. Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but, no matter. Fight you, then exclusively to save the Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time, then, for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes.\n\nI thought that in your struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently? I thought that whatever Negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do, in saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But Negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do any thing for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive\u2014even the promise of freedom. And the promise being made, must be kept....[When peace comes] then, there will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation; while, I fear, there will be some white ones, unable to forget that, with malignant heart, and deceitful speech, they strove to hinder it.\n}}\n\nThe timing of the Conkling letter came in August 1863, the month after two great Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, but also at a time when Americans were reading the first reports of black troops fighting courageously in battles at Milliken's Bend and Battery Wagner.  It was also in the summer of 1863 that Lincoln initiated his intensified effort to get various slave states to abolish slavery on their own.\n\nLincoln addresses the changes to his positions and actions regarding emancipation in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm |title=1864 letter to Albert G.

If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.\" Lincoln further explained that he had eventually determined that military emancipation and the enlistment of black soldiers were necessary for the preservation of the Union, which was his responsibility as President.\n\nHaving won re-election to the presidency in November 1864 on a platform of abolishing slavery, Lincoln and several members of his cabinet embarked on a sustained lobbying effort to get the abolition amendment through the House of Representatives.  The amendment abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States was ratified by every state that had abolished slavery during the war, and it became part of the Constitution in December, 1865.\n\n===Reconstruction===\nIn December 1863, Lincoln used his war powers and issued a \"[[Ten percent plan|Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction]]\", which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 47.</ref>\n\n===Thirteenth Amendment===\nWhen Lincoln accepted the nomination for the Union party for President in June, 1864, he called for the first time for the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], to immediately abolish slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. He wrote in his letter of acceptance that \"it would make a fitting and necessary conclusion\" to the war and would permanently join the causes of \"Liberty and Union.\" He won re-election on this platform in November, and in December, 1864, Lincoln worked to have the House approve the amendment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Foner |first=Eric |title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |publisher=W.W.

In order to meet the demands of the Department of the Navy the company needed laborers for its coal mines.</ref> Congress gravitated towards this plan in mid-1862, and Lincoln appointed Kansas Senator [[Samuel Pomeroy]] to oversee it.

Melissa is in the fourth grade. Her class is about to begin their production of ''Charlotte's Web''. Auditions are fast approaching, the class rules are that each girl will audition for the role of Charlotte and each boy will audition for the role of Wilbur, the pig. Melissa wants to audition for the role of Charlotte. When Melissa gets called out into the hall and does her audition as Charlotte, her teacher, Ms. Udell thinks Melissa is making a joke and tells Melissa that she cannot play the role of Charlotte because Ms. Udell sees Melissa as George. Since Melissa does not want to play a role other than Charlotte and Ms. Udell said that was not an option, Melissa takes a role in the stage crew. Meanwhile, at home, Melissa's mom finds her secret collection of female magazines. Melissa's mother views her actions as childish and says that she does not want to see Melissa wearing girl clothing, shoes, or going in her room at all. Back at school, Melissa is still upset with Ms. Udell's reaction to her audition. In addition, she feels distant from Kelly because Kelly got the role of Charlotte. However, as the classes' efforts to prepare for the upcoming production increased, Melissa finds a way to become the \"Charlotte\" of the stage crew. Inspired by Charlotte's courage, she gains the confidence to tell Kelly that she is a girl. After processing this news, Kelly is supportive of her best friend Melissa, and her efforts to tell the world she is a girl. One afternoon, as the stage crew is working on the set, Jeff, the class bully, says that if he met a talking spider he would step on it. Melissa feels the instinct to protect Charlotte and paints \"SOME JERK\" on a piece of paper and drops it on Jeff's back, painting his sweatshirt with the words.  After Jeff sees the damage, he punches Melissa to punish her for ruining his favourite sweatshirt, causing her to vomit on him. As a result of the fight, both Melissa and Jeff are in trouble with their teachers. However, in the process of getting punished, Melissa discovers that the Principal is sympathetic to transgender people.\n\nLater in the evening, when Melissa's mom questions her about the magazines, Melissa reveals to her mom that she is a girl. Her mom disregards her feelings, crushing Melissa in the process. On the other hand, when Melissa tells Scott that she is a girl, he thinks her feelings match her behaviour, and he offers his help and understanding to her. The night before the performance, Kelly and Melissa devise a plan for Melissa to be Charlotte in the play, which will help show the world that she is a girl. Kelly will perform in the morning, and Melissa will perform at the evening show. When it was time for Melissa to perform, people are shocked to see Melissa on stage, whom they all saw as a boy performing the role of a girl. Her mom is initially shocked at this performance but the performance later helps her become a more supportive and understanding mom to Melissa.\n\nAfter the excitement of the performance, Melissa feels more comfortable with herself. When Kelly invites her to spend the day with her uncle at the zoo, Melissa takes this opportunity to show herself as she chooses because she will be surrounded by people who do not already know her as George. Dressed in Kelly's clothing, she and Kelly happily enjoy the day at the zoo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=George|last=Gino, Alex|isbn=0545812577|location=New York|oclc=960835941}}</ref>\n\n== Genre ==\n[[File:Gay Pride Flag.svg|thumb|LGBTQ Flag]]\n''George'' falls under several genres of literature.

Hermann-Wilmarth and Caitlin L. Ryan contended that the novel instructs readers on how to be better allies for their transgender friends and peers through its focus on Melissa's interactions with other characters and the impact they have on her.<ref name=\":10\" /> How Melissa is either hurt or helped by these interactions in her coming-out process can help readers create safe spaces for transgender people to express their identities in real life.<ref name=\":10\" /> A book on the inclusion of queer adolescent literature in English Language Arts classes suggests the use of ''George'' in middle-level ELA classrooms as a means of promoting both allyship and critical discussion about how to remedy difference among their students.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nGender roles and how they define human interaction are also main themes in ''George''.<ref name=\":10\" /> Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan wrote that many of Melissa\u2019s interactions with both her peers and superiors exemplify the struggle of transgender children to challenge the gender binary.<ref name=\":10\" /> When Melissa tells Mrs. Udell, for example, that she wants to play Charlotte in the school play, Mrs. Udell does not take her seriously and even \u201cscowls\u201d at the idea, a response that demonstrates her strong discomfort with such a forward challenge of gender roles.<ref name=\":10\" /> Kelly and Scott, Melissa\u2019s best friend and brother, respectively, also have difficulty coming to terms with Melissa\u2019s identity as a female, while other kids at school bully her for her girlishness.<ref name=\":10\" /> She challenges the cisnormative expectations of these characters, resulting in either pain and violence, as in the case of her bullies, or eventual acceptance and growth in the case of her family members and close friends.<ref name=\":10\" /> By providing these various examples of how gender expectations govern different interactions and relationships between characters, ''George'' pushes its cisgender readers to consider what it means to be excluded from binary gender roles and how to rid themselves of strict gender expectations.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn a 2015 article in The Conversation, PhD candidate in Children's Literature Rebecca Cierazek discussed how ''George'' provides transgender children with a relatable narrative.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/who-are-you-junior-novel-george-wants-to-help-kids-understand-gender-identity-50835|title=Who are you?

Melissa is in the fourth grade. Her class is about to begin their production of ''Charlotte's Web''. Auditions are fast approaching, the class rules are that each girl will audition for the role of Charlotte and each boy will audition for the role of Wilbur, the pig. Melissa wants to audition for the role of Charlotte. When Melissa gets called out into the hall and does her audition as Charlotte, her teacher, Ms. Udell thinks Melissa is making a joke and tells Melissa that she cannot play the role of Charlotte because Ms. Udell sees Melissa as George. Since Melissa does not want to play a role other than Charlotte and Ms. Udell said that was not an option, Melissa takes a role in the stage crew. Meanwhile, at home, Melissa's mom finds her secret collection of female magazines. Melissa's mother views her actions as childish and says that she does not want to see Melissa wearing girl clothing, shoes, or going in her room at all. Back at school, Melissa is still upset with Ms. Udell's reaction to her audition. In addition, she feels distant from Kelly because Kelly got the role of Charlotte. However, as the classes' efforts to prepare for the upcoming production increased, Melissa finds a way to become the \"Charlotte\" of the stage crew. Inspired by Charlotte's courage, she gains the confidence to tell Kelly that she is a girl. After processing this news, Kelly is supportive of her best friend Melissa, and her efforts to tell the world she is a girl. One afternoon, as the stage crew is working on the set, Jeff, the class bully, says that if he met a talking spider he would step on it. Melissa feels the instinct to protect Charlotte and paints \"SOME JERK\" on a piece of paper and drops it on Jeff's back, painting his sweatshirt with the words.  After Jeff sees the damage, he punches Melissa to punish her for ruining his favourite sweatshirt, causing her to vomit on him. As a result of the fight, both Melissa and Jeff are in trouble with their teachers. However, in the process of getting punished, Melissa discovers that the Principal is sympathetic to transgender people.\n\nLater in the evening, when Melissa's mom questions her about the magazines, Melissa reveals to her mom that she is a girl. Her mom disregards her feelings, crushing Melissa in the process. On the other hand, when Melissa tells Scott that she is a girl, he thinks her feelings match her behaviour, and he offers his help and understanding to her. The night before the performance, Kelly and Melissa devise a plan for Melissa to be Charlotte in the play, which will help show the world that she is a girl. Kelly will perform in the morning, and Melissa will perform at the evening show. When it was time for Melissa to perform, people are shocked to see Melissa on stage, whom they all saw as a boy performing the role of a girl. Her mom is initially shocked at this performance but the performance later helps her become a more supportive and understanding mom to Melissa.\n\nAfter the excitement of the performance, Melissa feels more comfortable with herself. When Kelly invites her to spend the day with her uncle at the zoo, Melissa takes this opportunity to show herself as she chooses because she will be surrounded by people who do not already know her as George. Dressed in Kelly's clothing, she and Kelly happily enjoy the day at the zoo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=George|last=Gino, Alex|isbn=0545812577|location=New York|oclc=960835941}}</ref>\n\n== Genre ==\n[[File:Gay Pride Flag.svg|thumb|LGBTQ Flag]]\n''George'' falls under several genres of literature.

Hermann-Wilmarth and Caitlin L. Ryan contended that the novel instructs readers on how to be better allies for their transgender friends and peers through its focus on Melissa's interactions with other characters and the impact they have on her.<ref name=\":10\" /> How Melissa is either hurt or helped by these interactions in her coming-out process can help readers create safe spaces for transgender people to express their identities in real life.<ref name=\":10\" /> A book on the inclusion of queer adolescent literature in English Language Arts classes suggests the use of ''George'' in middle-level ELA classrooms as a means of promoting both allyship and critical discussion about how to remedy difference among their students.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nGender roles and how they define human interaction are also main themes in ''George''.<ref name=\":10\" /> Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan wrote that many of Melissa\u2019s interactions with both her peers and superiors exemplify the struggle of transgender children to challenge the gender binary.<ref name=\":10\" /> When Melissa tells Mrs. Udell, for example, that she wants to play Charlotte in the school play, Mrs. Udell does not take her seriously and even \u201cscowls\u201d at the idea, a response that demonstrates her strong discomfort with such a forward challenge of gender roles.<ref name=\":10\" /> Kelly and Scott, Melissa\u2019s best friend and brother, respectively, also have difficulty coming to terms with Melissa\u2019s identity as a female, while other kids at school bully her for her girlishness.<ref name=\":10\" /> She challenges the cisnormative expectations of these characters, resulting in either pain and violence, as in the case of her bullies, or eventual acceptance and growth in the case of her family members and close friends.<ref name=\":10\" /> By providing these various examples of how gender expectations govern different interactions and relationships between characters, ''George'' pushes its cisgender readers to consider what it means to be excluded from binary gender roles and how to rid themselves of strict gender expectations.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn a 2015 article in The Conversation, PhD candidate in Children's Literature Rebecca Cierazek discussed how ''George'' provides transgender children with a relatable narrative.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/who-are-you-junior-novel-george-wants-to-help-kids-understand-gender-identity-50835|title=Who are you?

Morrow writes, the problems that transgender children face both privately and publicly are addressed head-on by Alex Gino in ''George''.

This claim became the justification for English charters across America to the Atlantic coast and soon influenced further national expansion projects on the continent. Today, Drake's landing site is known as [[Point Reyes]], [[California]], a marine environment which is the setting of several small towns, ranches, and [[Point Reyes National Seashore]].\n\nDrake, after successfully sacking Spanish towns and plundering Spanish ships along their eastern Pacific coast colonies, sought safe harbour to prepare his ship, ''[[Golden Hind]]'', for [[circumnavigation]] back to England.  He found it on 17 June 1579, when he and his crew landed on the Pacific coast at what is now Point Reyes in [[Northern California]].  While encamped there, he had friendly relations with the [[Coast Miwok]] people who inhabited the area near his landing. Naming the area ''Nova Albion'', or New Albion, he claimed sovereignty of the area for [[Elizabeth I of England]], an act which would have significant long-term historical consequences. Sailing away on 23 July and leaving behind no colony, Drake eventually circumnavigated the globe and returned to England in September 1580.\n\nOver the years, numerous speculative sites along the North American Pacific coast were investigated as the area of Drake's New Albion claim. Through the following centuries, various cartographers and mariners identified the area near Point Reyes as Drake's likely landing place. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, definitive evidence was gathered, particularly regarding Drake's contact with the Coast Miwok people and porcelain shards which were established to be remnants of Drake's cargo. The various avenues of research led to the [[United States Department of the Interior]] formally recognising Drake's landing point to be at Point Reyes, giving a [[National Historic Landmark]] designation in October 2012.\n\n==Founding by Drake==\n\n===Background===\nIn the late 1500s, a [[Cold war (general term)|cold war]] existed between England and [[Spain]]\u2014one which involved religious differences, economic pressure, and emerging English navigational and colonisation desires.{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=135}} As part of this, [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] developed a plan to plunder Spanish colonial settlements on the Pacific Coast of the [[New World]].{{sfn|Sugden|2006|pp=92\u201398}} Gathering several investors,{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=2}} and likely with the backing of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]\u2014which may have been in the form of a secret commission as a [[privateer]]\u2014Drake embarked upon the voyage on 15 November 1577.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|pp=98, 101, 109, 110}}{{sfn|Woodard|2007|p=2}} Even though Drake's actions would damage England's relations with Spain's [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]], Drake understood he could rely upon Queen Elizabeth's support.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=98}}\n\nAfter successfully taking considerable amounts of treasure from Spaniish towns and ships along King Phhilip's eastern Pacific coast colonies, Drake sailed north to seek a shortcut back to England via the hypothetical Strait of Ani\u00e1n, a supposedly navigable shortcut connecting the Pacific and Atlantic. The strait, a fanciful idea similar to the [[Fountain of Youth]],  was speculated to exist at about 40 degrees north.{{sfn|DNG|2019}}{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=132}} Although Drake may have possibly reached a latitude  as high as 48 degree, his northward progress was ultimately stopped by foul weather in [[Winds in the Age of Sail|the northeast trade winds belt]].{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=3}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=16}}  Upon failing to locate the strait, Drake sought safe harbour to ready his  ship, ''Golden Hind'', before attempting a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe to return home.\n\n===Drake's coastal exploration and claim===\n[[File:Joducus hondius new albion 1589.png|right|thumb|Joducus hondius new albion 1589| The Hondius map ''The Vera Totius Expeditionis Navticae'' inset depicts Drake's encampment at New Albion, ''Portus Novas Albionis''.

By navigating well beyond where Cabrillo had asserted Spanish claim, Drake sought to locate a discreet site at which the crew could prepare for the journey back to England.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=15}}\n\nOn 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at [[Cape Arago State Park|South Cove, Cape Arago]], just south of [[Coos Bay, Oregon]].{{sfn|Von der Porten|1975|pp=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=700}}{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=263}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=14}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=163}} From there, Drake sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship.{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=263}} On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California.{{sfn|Cassels|2003|pp=263,264}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=15}} While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as ''Nova Albion'' or New Albion, choosing this particular name for two reasons: first, the white banks and cliffs which he saw were similar to [[White Cliffs of Dover|those]] found on the English coast and, second, because ''[[Albion]]'' was an archaic name by which the island of Great Britain was known.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=136,137}} To document and assert his claim, Drake had an engraved plate of brass, one which contained a sixpence bearing Elizabeth's image, attached to a large post. Giving details of Drake's visit, it claimed sovereignty for Elizabeth and every successive English monarch.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=173}}\n\nAfter erecting a fort and tents ashore, the crew labored for several weeks as they prepared for the circumnavigating voyage ahead by [[careen]]ing their ship, ''Golden Hind'', so to effectively  clean and repair the hull.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=135}} Drake had friendly interactions with the [[Coast Miwok]] and explored the surrounding land by foot when crossing [[Inverness Ridge]] to visit a village and reconnoiter the country.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} When his ship was ready for the return voyage, Drake and the crew left New Albion on 23 July and  paused his journey the next day when  anchoring his ship at the [[Farallon Islands]] where the crew hunted seal meat.{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=702}}{{sfn|Torben|2019|p=184}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=183,184}}  On July 25, they sailed west to continue their Pacific crossing, and ''Golden Hind'' finally returned to England in September 1580.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=184}}{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=144}}\n\n===English response===\nDrake's circumnavigation began a period of British maritime dominance that lasted until the twentieth century, and as a result of his successful deeds against Spain, Drake was admired and celebrated by many in England.{{sfn|Cummins|1997|p=189}} According to [[John Stow]], Drake's \"name and fame became admirable in all places, the people swarming daily in the streets to behold him, vowing hatred of all that durst mislike him.\"{{sfn|Thrower|1984|p=151}}  Not only were his investors and the Queen richly rewarded, Drake was also allowed to keep \u00a324,000 of the purloined treasure for himself and his crew.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=149}} Drake quickly became a favorite at the Queens's court and was knighted by the French Ambassador on her behalf.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=151}}\n\n[[File:Sype - La herdike enterprinse faict par le Signeur Draeck.jpeg|thumb|left|This early 1580s, Nikola van Sype map shows Nova Albion as an imprecise area across the western part of North America.]]Initially, details of Drake's voyage were suppressed, and Drake's sailors were pledged not to disclose their route under threat of death.{{sfn|Polk|1995|p=241}}{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=1}} When Drake returned, he handed over his log and a large map to the Queen.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=20}} While the other items disappeared, the map known as the Queen's Map, remained on limited view for a number of years.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=5}} Finally, it too was lost in the [[Whitehall Palace]] fire of 1698.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=7}} However, a derivative of this map, ''Vera Totius Expeditionis Navticae'', was composed by [[Jodocus Hondius]] sometime around 1590, and into it he incorporated features from the Queen's Map.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=20}} This map shows Drake's journey and includes an inset of the harbor at ''Nova Albion''.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=20}} In 1589, further details emerged when an official account of Drake's circumnavigating voyage by [[Richard Hakluyt]] was published. In 1628, ''The World Encompassed,'' was published in 1628 by Drake's nephew and namesake, [[Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet]].  This comprehensive account of the voyage,  which is based on the notes of his chaplain [[Francis Fletcher (priest)|Francis Fletcher]], included numerous details of New Albion and is the most extensive account of Drake's voyage.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=111}}\n\nBecause the extent of Drake's New Albion was vague\u2014essentially a classification of the territory north and west of Spanish territory\u2014the designated location differs among maps.{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=16}} After Elizabeth's death in 1603, maps began to depict the area of North America above Mexico as ''Nova Albion''. Drake's claim of land on the Pacific coast for England became a basis which influenced subsequent colonial charters issued by English monarchs that purported to grant lands from sea to sea, the area from the Atlantic where English colonies were first settled all the way to the Pacific.{{sfn|Anon|2018|p=8}} Along with [[Martin Frobisher]]'s claims in Greenland and Baffin Island and [[Humphrey Gilbert]]'s 1583 claim of Newfoundland, New Albion was one of the earliest English territorial claims in the New World.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=118}} These claims were eventually followed by settlement of the [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1584, and [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=118}}\n\n==The people and the land==\n\n[[File:Fully feathered basket Santa Roas College.jpg|thumb|This basket, on display at the Jesse Peter Museum, is similar to the fully feathered basket described in ''The World Encompassed''.]] [[File:Point Reyes and Drakes Bay.jpg|thumb|New Albion as seen from the air.

But Drake quickly allayed their suspicions, and multitudes of unarmed people soon visited his encampment on a daily basis.  {{sfn|Morison|1978|p=702}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=174}}  In their early encounters  with the Coast Miwok, Drake's crew observed as the Miwok wailed and engaged in self-laceration. Drake misinterpreted this response as an act of worship and concluded that the Indians believed him and his crew to be gods; however, this response was actually one of Miwok mourning customs.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}} Most likely the Indians regarded the English visitors as relatives who had returned from the dead.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}} In a particularly significant gesture, one day a large assembly of Coast Miwok descended on the encampment and honored Drake by placing chains around his neck, a sceptre in his hand, and a crown of feathers on his head as if he were being proclaimed king.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}} Upon this uncertain, seemingly voluntary surrender of sovereignty by its owners, England based its presumed legal authority to the territory.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}} \n\nAfter gaining the Coast Miwok's trust, Drake journeyed to explore the inland area and visit their villages.  Accompanied with crew members, Drake trekked on a Coast Miwok trail to traverse the [[Inverness Ridge]] and descend into what is now the [[Olema Valley]].{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} Fletcher described the  village structures there as round subterranean buildings which came together at the top like spires on a steeple.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=181}}  Fletcher made further note of their culture by recording detailed characteristics of the Coast Miwok baskets stating they were water-tight, shaped like a deep bowl, and covered with a matted down of colored feathers.{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=10}} Such baskets were made only by the Coast Miwok, Pomo, Lake Miwok, Patwin, and Wappo peoples who were all concentrated near Drake's landing site.{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=10}}  Additionally, Fletcher was the first person to make a written record of any of the 64 distinct language groups in prehistoric California, namely five specific Coast Miwok words: ''Hioh, Gnaah, Huchee kecharo, Nacharo mu'', and ''Cheepe''.{{sfn|Hinton|1994|p=13}}{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=12}} These words noted by Fletcher are from a distinct language group, and Heizer wrote that they were unquestionably of Coast Miwok derivation, linguistic proof of Drake's contact with the Coast Miwok.{{sfn|Hinton|1994|p=13}}{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=12}} Overall, the relations between the Coast Miwok and their visitors were peaceful and friendly, and the Miwok seemed to exhibit distress when ''Golden Hind'' sailed away.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=138}}\n\nFletcher also recorded climate information and characterised the unpleasant summer weather conditions of the area near the careenage basin.  He noted the continuous nipping chill; lack of sun; and cold, sometimes violent, winds.{{sfn|Turner|2006|pp=182,183}} In contrast, across the Inverness Ridge, he found a distinct climate variance and experienced a flourishing land.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} Fletcher assessed the area: \"The inland we found to be farre different from the shoare, a goodly country and fruitful soyle, stored with many blessings fit for the use of man\".{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} \n\nFletcher also chronicled his observation of certain animals unknown to the English and described them as \"very large and fat Deere\" and \"a multitude of a strange kinde of Conies.\"{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=181}} The \"fat Deere\" were most likely [[Roosevelt Elk]], and the conies are identified as [[gophers]].{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=703}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=181}}   These, and the rest, of Fletcher's assessments and observations of New Albion are flawlessly in concert with the geography of the Point Reyes.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=170}}\n\n==Historical impact==\n[[File:Western North America 1778.png|thumb|[[Jonathan Carver]]'s 1778 map shows the continuing ''Nova Albion'' claim.]]\n\nThe New Albion claim had far-reaching historical consequences. Even though Drake attempted no long-term presence and the English made no immediate follow up to the claim, it constituted England's first assertion of sovereignty on the North American Pacific shore.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=188}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=17}} And since all of their subsequent expeditions along the North American Pacific Coast were infrequent and irregular, Nova Albion was primarily a geographical designation\u2014a new, distinctive name on the world map.{{sfn|Gough|1992|p=23}}{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=157}} Ultimately, this designation was of significance as it proclaimed England's ability and presumed right to pursue its own empire in America.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=137}} Consequently, Drake's New Albion claim was a forward-thinking, considered component of a new national expansion policy, one of several of his exploits which both determined Elizabeth's policy for the duration of her reign and indirectly impacted England's continuing historical future.{{sfn|Woodward|2017|p=34}}\n\nThe New Albion claim was the first indication of English goals broader than simple reprisal against Spain which then influenced similar national expansion projects by others such as [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].{{sfn|Woodward|2017|p=39}} As a rejection of territorial claims based on [[Papal Authority|papal authority]], the New Albion claim asserted Elizabeth's notion of territorial claim by occupation, and this promoted the colonial idea of New Albion as \"the back side of Virginia,\" the expression of England's presumed legal status of sea-to-sea colonial entitlement.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=137}}{{sfn|Anon|2018|p=8}}  The claim occupied a significant place in British geopolitical considerations for centuries and even strengthened Britain's entitlement to the fur trade commerce along the Northwest Coast.{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=148}}  Its final influential assertion came in negotiaing the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] which extended the border of [[Canada]] along the 49th parallel to the Pacific.{{sfn|Gough|1980|pp=16, 123, 125}}\n\n==Site recognition and identification==\n\n===Early identifications===\n\nBeginning in the seventeenth century, maps identify [[Drakes Bay]] as Drake's landing site.{{sfn|Wagner|1926|p=161}} In 1793, [[George Vancouver]] studied the site, and concluded it was in Drakes Bay.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=290}} Professor [[George Davidson (geographer)|George Davidson]], of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], after a study of the narrative and the coast, identified the harbour entered by Drake as Drakes Bay, at Point Reyes, about thirty miles (50&nbsp;km) north of San Francisco. \"Drakes Bay,\" he reported in 1886, \"is a capital harbor in northwest winds, such as Drake encountered. It is easily entered, sheltered by high lands, and a vessel may anchor in three fathoms, close under the shore in good holding ground.\"{{sfn|Davidson|1887|p=214}} Davidson published further support for the Drakes Bay location in 1890 and 1908.{{sfn|Davidson|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Davidson|1908|p=108}}\n\n===Twentieth-century identifications===\n\n[[File:Wpdms usgs photo drakes bay large.jpg|right |thumb |upright=1.0 |Drakes Bay, northwest of [[San Francisco]]]]\n\nIn 1947, following up on work by archaeologists [[Alfred L.

Confirming their work Heizer states that \"Drake must have landed in territory occupied by the [[Coast Miwok]]-speaking natives.\" In his full analysis, Heizer concludes, \"in June 1579, then, Drake probably landed in what is now known as Drake's Bay.\"{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=15}}\nSince 1949, the theory that Drake landed at Drakes Bay has been advocated by the [[Drake Navigators Guild]] in California, and by former president Captain [[Adolph S. Oko, Jr.]], former honorary chairman [[Chester W. Nimitz]], and former president [[Raymond Aker]]. Oko wrote, \"Many other correlative facts have been ... found true to the Drake's Cove site as part of the ''total body of evidence''. The weight of evidence truly establishes Drake's Cove as the nodal point of Nova Albion.\"{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=152}} Nimitz stated that he did \"not doubt that in time the public will come to recognize the importance and value of this long-lost site, and will rank it with other National Historic Sites such as [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], and [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]].\"{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=150}}  In 1956, Sir Alex A. Cumming, who was the curator of [[Buckland Abbey]], Drake's past home and current museum, also recognised Drake's landing: \"That little cove at the mouth of the Estero, sheltered from the wind, protected from the sea and hidden from hostile eyes, must have been a welcome sight, and I believe that Divine Providence guided him to it.\"{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=150}} In 1978, two time [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] wrote \"...that Drakes Bay is correctly so named, that here he spent five weeks, repaired the ''Golden Hind'', sang songs for the Indians, and marched up country.\"{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=713}} [[File:Porcelain Shards FSCN0763.jpg|thumb|left |Display at Point Reyes National Seashore Visitor Center of Ming porcelain shards from Drake's 1579 landing and Cerme\u00f1o's 1595 Manila galleon shipwreck.

The geography of Drake's Cove, which lies along the coast of [[Marin County, CA|Marin County]], has often been suggested as being similar to the cove described by Drake, including the white cliffs that look like the south coast of England and the specific configuration of the Cove. Responding to questions about the geographical fit of the cove, Aker maintained that criticisms\u2014those based on the inconsistent configuration of the sandbars in the cove\u2014were unfounded. He maintained the configuration of the sandbars in the cove was cyclic over the decades. Accordingly, Aker effectively answered the questions when he predicted that a spit of land that disappeared in 1956\u2014one which closely resembles one on the Hondius map\u2014would reappear. Aker's assertions were confirmed when the spit formed again in 2001.{{sfn|Dell'Osso|2001}}\n\nArtefactual evidence emerged when nearly one hundred pieces of sixteenth-century Chinese porcelain wares were found in the vicinity of the Drake's Cove site which, according to Clarence Shangraw of the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]] and archaeologist [[Edward Von der Porten]], \"must fairly be attributed to Francis Drake's ''Golden Hind'' visit of 1579.\"{{sfn|Shangraw|Von der Porten|1981|p=73}}{{sfn|Pomper|1994|pp=13-14}} These ceramic samples, found at Point Reyes, are the earliest datable archaeological specimens of Chinese porcelains  transported across the Pacific in Manilla galleons.{{sfn|Kuwayama|1997|p=20}} The artefacts were found by four different agencies beginning with the [[University of California]], the Drake Navigators Guild, then the [[Santa Rosa Junior College]], and finally [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]].{{sfn|Kuwayama|1997|p=20}} These porcelain shards are the remains of porcelain dishes Drake took from a Spanish treasure ship in the Pacific.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=268}} Off-loaded during the careening process and abandoned when Drake sailed from Point Reyes, the porcelain wares were the heaviest items of unknown value that he carried.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=268}}\n\nThe porcelains were first identified by Shangraw and then later by Von der Porten.{{sfn|L.A.

The Drake porcelains have clean breaks and show no abrasion from the abrasive action of being tumbled in the surf. In contrast, the Cerme\u00f1o shards display surf-tumbling, design change, and differences in style and quality\u2014all which suggests two separate cargoes.{{sfn|Meniketti|2013|p=17}} Drake's purloined cargo included fine porcelain dishes from [[Jingdezhen]], [[China]], the industrial centre of finely crafted ceramics.{{sfn|L.A.

Using varied shipwreck sources to provide strong controls to the research, Meniketti's findings support the Cerme\u00f1o porcelains and the Drake ceramics are from two different ships. He states that these two cargoes can be distinguished based on differences in their key elements and believes these differences may represent changes in glaze chemistry, clay sources, or unique inclusions or tempering.{{sfn|Meniketti|2013|p=18}} Aker maintained that those porcelain sherds that washed onto shore must be attributed to Cerme\u00f1o, and those with clean breaks and no water wear must be attributed to Drake.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=290}}\n\n[[File:NPS Plaque IMG 1136.jpg|thumb |right |upright=1.2 |[[National Historic Landmark]] commemorating and honoring Sir Francis Drake, Sebastian Rodriguez Cerme\u00f1o, and Coast Miwok people at Point Reyes, California]]Historian Dr. John Sugden, after reviewing numerous proposed Drake landing sites, observed, \"No aspect of Drake's career has suffered more false leads than the site of Nova Albion.\"  Sugden concludes that \"the evidence overwhelmingly favours Drake's Estero in Drakes Bay\" and that \"it is high time the United States register of National Historic Landmarks officially recognized Drake's Estero as the Elizabethan anchorage.\"{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=332}}\n\n===Official recognitions===\nThe site of Drake's landing as officially recognised by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] and other agencies is Drake's Cove.

Samuel Bawlf suggested that Drake's landing was on present day [[Vancouver Island]] at [[Comox, British Columbia]] {{nowrap|({{coord|49.66|-124.95|format=dms}}).}} Bawlf supported the idea that Drake careened ''Golden Hind'' in Whale Cove, Oregon, and he pointed to a number of pieces of evidence in support of his view that the official published record of Drake's voyage was deliberately altered to suppress the true extent of his discoveries.{{sfn|Bawlf|2003}}\n\n==Speculation of a colony==\n\nA counting discrepancy of ''Golden Hind'' crew members has led to speculation that Drake left behind men to form a colony.  The idea that Drake formed a colony is, however, suspect\u2014it is improbable that Drake would have left settlers at New Albion since he had not equipped the voyage for colonization. {{sfn|Davis|2013|p=189}}  Drake was also undoubtedly aware that England would have trouble enforcing its claim by supporting a nascent colony in a land so remote as New Albion and would have likely avoided planting such an English outpost. {{sfn|Sugden|2006|pp=118, 137}}  Additionally, the only person specifically reported as left behind at New Albion was [[N. de Morena]], a European [[ship pilot]] who was in ill health. Spanish sources state that he was left ashore, recovered his health, and eventually embarked on a successful four-year journey by walking to Mexico where he reported to authorities. {{sfn|Allen|1997|p=433}}\n\nThe counting discrepancy, a difference of at least 20 men, concerns the number of crew Drake commanded before his stay in Northern California as compared to crew tallies when he reached the [[Moluccas]], an archipelago in the [[Banda Sea]], [[Indonesia]].  Released Spanish prisoners stated that, off the coast of [[Central America]], the ship's company was about 80 men. Sir Francis Drake's cousin and crew member,  [[John Drake (pirate)|John Drake]], claimed the number totaled 60 when the ship was at [[Ternate]] in the Moluccas.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=177}} On Vesuvius Reef, ''The World Encompassed'' puts the number at 58.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=177}}  All notions of an embryo colony are primarily based on these numbers, and the reason for this discrepancy remains unknown.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=177}}\n\n==Plate of Brass hoax==\n{{Main|Drake's Plate of Brass}}\n\nIn the 1900s, a [[hoax]] was perpetrated regarding the brass plate which Drake had posted at New Albion.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}}  English historian [[Richard Hakluyt]] wrote in detail of the distinctive original plate:\n\n{{quote|text=At our departure hence our General set up a monument of our being there, as also of her Majesty's right and title to the same; namely a plate,        nailed upon a fair great post, whereupon was engraved her Majesty's name, the day and year of our arrival there, with the free giving up of the province and people into her Majesty's hands, together with her Highness' picture and arms, in a piece of six pence of current English money, under the plate, whereunder was also written the name of our General.{{sfn|Hakluyt|2015|pp=16-17}}}}\n\nThe original plate\u2014which served as tangible notice of England's sovereignty over the land\u2014has yet to be found.{{sfn|Von_der_Porten|Aker|Allen|Spitze|2002|pp=116-133}}  Consequently, the exact location of the monument erected by Drake is unknown.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}}\n\nIn 1936, a counterfeit, known as [[Drake's Plate of Brass]], came to public attention, and for decades its discovery was widely believed to be that of the original.{{sfn|Von_der_Porten|Aker|Allen|Spitze|2002|pp=116-133}} While accepted as authentic by the [[University of California, Berkeley]], doubts persisted. Eventually, in the late 1970s, the supposed original plate failed a battery of metallurgical tests, and scientists determined that the plate was a modern creation.{{sfn|Craddock|2009|pp=150,151}} In 2003, it was publicly revealed that the counterfeit plate was created as a [[practical joke]] among local historians. Spinning out of control, the joke unintentionally became a public hoax and embarrassment to those who had once confirmed its authenticity.{{sfn|Von_der_Porten|Aker|Allen|Spitze|2002|pp=116-133}}[[File:Artwork in Saint Columba's, Inverness Park, California, showing Episcopal missions at Nova Albion.jpg|thumb|Artwork hanging in Saint Columba's, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and Retreat House in [[Inverness Park]], California, shows the ''Golden Hind'' and Episcopal missions at ''Nova Albion''.]]\n\n==Localised legacy==\n\nThe localised legacy of Drake's New Albion claim is evident in several ways. The inspiration of various local namesakes is owed to the notion of this declaration.

This claim became the justification for English charters across America to the Atlantic coast and soon influenced further national expansion projects on the continent. Today, Drake's landing site is known as [[Point Reyes]], [[California]], a marine environment which is the setting of several small towns, ranches, and [[Point Reyes National Seashore]].\n\nDrake, after successfully sacking Spanish towns and plundering Spanish ships along their eastern Pacific coast colonies, sought safe harbour to prepare his ship, ''[[Golden Hind]]'', for [[circumnavigation]] back to England.  He found it on 17 June 1579, when he and his crew landed on the Pacific coast at what is now Point Reyes in [[Northern California]].  While encamped there, he had friendly relations with the [[Coast Miwok]] people who inhabited the area near his landing. Naming the area ''Nova Albion'', or New Albion, he claimed sovereignty of the area for [[Elizabeth I of England]], an act which would have significant long-term historical consequences. Sailing away on 23 July and leaving behind no colony, Drake eventually circumnavigated the globe and returned to England in September 1580.\n\nOver the years, numerous speculative sites along the North American Pacific coast were investigated as the area of Drake's New Albion claim. Through the following centuries, various cartographers and mariners identified the area near Point Reyes as Drake's likely landing place. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, definitive evidence was gathered, particularly regarding Drake's contact with the Coast Miwok people and porcelain shards which were established to be remnants of Drake's cargo. The various avenues of research led to the [[United States Department of the Interior]] formally recognising Drake's landing point to be at Point Reyes, giving a [[National Historic Landmark]] designation in October 2012.\n\n==Founding by Drake==\n\n===Background===\nIn the late 1500s, a [[Cold war (general term)|cold war]] existed between England and [[Spain]]\u2014one which involved religious differences, economic pressure, and emerging English navigational and colonisation desires.{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=135}} As part of this, [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] developed a plan to plunder Spanish colonial settlements on the Pacific Coast of the [[New World]].{{sfn|Sugden|2006|pp=92\u201398}} Gathering several investors,{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=2}} and likely with the backing of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]\u2014which may have been in the form of a secret commission as a [[privateer]]\u2014Drake embarked upon the voyage on 15 November 1577.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|pp=98, 101, 109, 110}}{{sfn|Woodard|2007|p=2}} Even though Drake's actions would damage England's relations with Spain's [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]], Drake understood he could rely upon Queen Elizabeth's support.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=98}}\n\nAfter successfully taking considerable amounts of treasure from Spaniish towns and ships along King Phhilip's eastern Pacific coast colonies, Drake sailed north to seek a shortcut back to England via the hypothetical Strait of Ani\u00e1n, a supposedly navigable shortcut connecting the Pacific and Atlantic. The strait, a fanciful idea similar to the [[Fountain of Youth]],  was speculated to exist at about 40 degrees north.{{sfn|DNG|2019}}{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=132}} Although Drake may have possibly reached a latitude  as high as 48 degree, his northward progress was ultimately stopped by foul weather in [[Winds in the Age of Sail|the northeast trade winds belt]].{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=3}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=16}}  Upon failing to locate the strait, Drake sought safe harbour to ready his  ship, ''Golden Hind'', before attempting a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe to return home.\n\n===Drake's coastal exploration and claim===\n\n[[File:Joducus hondius new albion 1589.png|right|thumb|Joducus hondius new albion 1589| The Hondius map ''The Vera Totius Expeditionis Navticae'' inset depicts Drake's encampment at New Albion, ''Portus Novas Albionis''.

By navigating well beyond where Cabrillo had asserted Spanish claim, Drake sought to locate a discreet site at which the crew could prepare for the journey back to England.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=15}}\n\nOn 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at [[Cape Arago State Park|South Cove, Cape Arago]], just south of [[Coos Bay, Oregon]].{{sfn|Von der Porten|1975|pp=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=700}}{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=263}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=14}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=163}} From there, Drake sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship.{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=263}} On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California.{{sfn|Cassels|2003|pp=263,264}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=15}} While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as ''Nova Albion'' or New Albion, choosing this particular name for two reasons: first, the white banks and cliffs which he saw were similar to [[White Cliffs of Dover|those]] found on the English coast and, second, because ''[[Albion]]'' was an archaic name by which the island of Great Britain was known.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=136,137}} To document and assert his claim, Drake had an engraved plate of brass, one which contained a sixpence bearing Elizabeth's image, attached to a large post. Giving details of Drake's visit, it claimed sovereignty for Elizabeth and every successive English monarch.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=173}}\n\nAfter erecting a fort and tents ashore, the crew labored for several weeks as they prepared for the circumnavigating voyage ahead by [[careen]]ing their ship, ''Golden Hind'', so to effectively  clean and repair the hull.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=135}} Drake had friendly interactions with the [[Coast Miwok]] and explored the surrounding land by foot when crossing [[Inverness Ridge]] to visit a village and reconnoiter the country.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} When his ship was ready for the return voyage, Drake and the crew left New Albion on 23 July and  paused his journey the next day when  anchoring his ship at the [[Farallon Islands]] where the crew hunted seal meat.{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=702}}{{sfn|Torben|2019|p=184}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=183,184}}  On July 25, they sailed west to continue their Pacific crossing, and ''Golden Hind'' finally returned to England in September 1580.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=184}}{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=144}}\n\n===English response===\nDrake's circumnavigation began a period of British maritime dominance that lasted until the twentieth century, and as a result of his successful deeds against Spain, Drake was admired and celebrated by many in England.{{sfn|Cummins|1997|p=189}} According to [[John Stow]], Drake's \"name and fame became admirable in all places, the people swarming daily in the streets to behold him, vowing hatred of all that durst mislike him.\"{{sfn|Thrower|1984|p=151}}  Not only were his investors and the Queen richly rewarded, Drake was also allowed to keep \u00a324,000 of the purloined treasure for himself and his crew.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=149}} Drake quickly became a favorite at the Queens's court and was knighted by the French Ambassador on her behalf.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=151}}\n\n[[File:Sype - La herdike enterprinse faict par le Signeur Draeck.jpeg|thumb|left|This early 1580s, Nikola van Sype map shows Nova Albion as an imprecise area across the western part of North America.]]Initially, details of Drake's voyage were suppressed, and Drake's sailors were pledged not to disclose their route under threat of death.{{sfn|Polk|1995|p=241}}{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=1}} When Drake returned, he handed over his log and a large map to the Queen.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=20}} While the other items disappeared, the map known as the Queen's Map, remained on limited view for a number of years.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=5}} Finally, it too was lost in the [[Whitehall Palace]] fire of 1698.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=7}} However, a derivative of this map, ''Vera Totius Expeditionis Navticae'', was composed by [[Jodocus Hondius]] sometime around 1590, and into it he incorporated features from the Queen's Map.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=20}} This map shows Drake's journey and includes an inset of the harbor at ''Nova Albion''.{{sfn|Wallis|1979|p=20}} In 1589, further details emerged when an official account of Drake's circumnavigating voyage by [[Richard Hakluyt]] was published. In 1628, ''The World Encompassed,'' was published in 1628 by Drake's nephew and namesake, [[Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet]].  This comprehensive account of the voyage,  which is based on the notes of his chaplain [[Francis Fletcher (priest)|Francis Fletcher]], included numerous details of New Albion and is the most extensive account of Drake's voyage.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=111}}\n\nBecause the extent of Drake's New Albion was vague\u2014essentially a classification of the territory north and west of Spanish territory\u2014the designated location differs among maps.{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=16}} After Elizabeth's death in 1603, maps began to depict the area of North America above Mexico as ''Nova Albion''. Drake's claim of land on the Pacific coast for England became a basis which influenced subsequent colonial charters issued by English monarchs that purported to grant lands from sea to sea, the area from the Atlantic where English colonies were first settled all the way to the Pacific.{{sfn|Anon|2018|p=8}} Along with [[Martin Frobisher]]'s claims in Greenland and Baffin Island and [[Humphrey Gilbert]]'s 1583 claim of Newfoundland, New Albion was one of the earliest English territorial claims in the New World.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=118}} These claims were eventually followed by settlement of the [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1584, and [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=118}}\n\n==The people and the land==\n\n[[File:Fully feathered basket Santa Roas College.jpg|thumb|This basket, on display at the Jesse Peter Museum, is similar to the fully feathered basket described in ''The World Encompassed''.]] [[File:Point Reyes and Drakes Bay.jpg|thumb|New Albion as seen from the air.

But Drake quickly allayed their suspicions, and multitudes of unarmed people soon visited his encampment on a daily basis.  {{sfn|Morison|1978|p=702}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=174}}  In their early encounters  with the Coast Miwok, Drake's crew observed as the Miwok wailed and engaged in self-laceration. Drake misinterpreted this response as an act of worship and concluded that the Indians believed him and his crew to be gods; however, this response was actually one of Miwok mourning customs.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}} Most likely the Indians regarded the English visitors as relatives who had returned from the dead.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}} In a particularly significant gesture, one day a large assembly of Coast Miwok descended on the encampment and honored Drake by placing chains around his neck, a sceptre in his hand, and a crown of feathers on his head as if he were being proclaimed king.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}} Upon this uncertain, seemingly voluntary surrender of sovereignty by its owners, England based its presumed legal authority to the territory.{{sfn|Rawls|Bean|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}} \n\nAfter gaining the Coast Miwok's trust, Drake journeyed to explore the inland area and visit their villages.  Accompanied with crew members, Drake trekked on a Coast Miwok trail to traverse the [[Inverness Ridge]] and descend into what is now the [[Olema Valley]].{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} Fletcher described the  village structures there as round subterranean buildings which came together at the top like spires on a steeple.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=181}}  Fletcher made further note of their culture by recording detailed characteristics of the Coast Miwok baskets stating they were water-tight, shaped like a deep bowl, and covered with a matted down of colored feathers.{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=10}} Such baskets were made only by the Coast Miwok, Pomo, Lake Miwok, Patwin, and Wappo peoples who were all concentrated near Drake's landing site.{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=10}}  Additionally, Fletcher was the first person to make a written record of any of the 64 distinct language groups in prehistoric California, namely five specific Coast Miwok words: ''Hioh, Gnaah, Huchee kecharo, Nacharo mu'', and ''Cheepe''.{{sfn|Hinton|1994|p=13}}{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=12}} These words noted by Fletcher are from a distinct language group, and Heizer wrote that they were unquestionably of Coast Miwok derivation, linguistic proof of Drake's contact with the Coast Miwok.{{sfn|Hinton|1994|p=13}}{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=12}} Overall, the relations between the Coast Miwok and their visitors were peaceful and friendly, and the Miwok seemed to exhibit distress when ''Golden Hind'' sailed away.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=138}}\n\nFletcher also recorded climate information and characterised the unpleasant summer weather conditions of the area near the careenage basin.  He noted the continuous nipping chill; lack of sun; and cold, sometimes violent, winds.{{sfn|Turner|2006|pp=182,183}} In contrast, across the Inverness Ridge, he found a distinct climate variance and experienced a flourishing land.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} Fletcher assessed the area: \"The inland we found to be farre different from the shoare, a goodly country and fruitful soyle, stored with many blessings fit for the use of man\".{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=180}} \n\nFletcher also chronicled his observation of certain animals unknown to the English and described them as \"very large and fat Deere\" and \"a multitude of a strange kinde of Conies.\"{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=181}} The \"fat Deere\" were most likely [[Roosevelt Elk]], and the conies are identified as [[gophers]].{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=703}}{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=181}}   These, and the rest, of Fletcher's assessments and observations of New Albion are flawlessly in concert with the geography of the Point Reyes.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=170}}\n\n==Historical impact==\n[[File:Western North America 1778.png|thumb|[[Jonathan Carver]]'s 1778 map shows the continuing ''Nova Albion'' claim.]]\n\nThe New Albion claim had far-reaching historical consequences. Even though Drake attempted no long-term presence and the English made no immediate follow up to the claim, it constituted England's first assertion of sovereignty on the North American Pacific shore.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=188}}{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=17}} And since all of their subsequent expeditions along the North American Pacific Coast were infrequent and irregular, Nova Albion was primarily a geographical designation\u2014a new, distinctive name on the world map.{{sfn|Gough|1992|p=23}}{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=157}} Ultimately, this designation was of significance as it proclaimed England's ability and presumed right to pursue its own empire in America.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=137}} Consequently, Drake's New Albion claim was a forward-thinking, considered component of a new national expansion policy, one of several of his exploits which both determined Elizabeth's policy for the duration of her reign and indirectly impacted England's continuing historical future.{{sfn|Woodward|2017|p=34}}\n\nThe New Albion claim was the first indication of English goals broader than simple reprisal against Spain which then influenced similar national expansion projects by others such as [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].{{sfn|Woodward|2017|p=39}} As a rejection of territorial claims based on [[Papal Authority|papal authority]], the New Albion claim asserted Elizabeth's notion of territorial claim by occupation, and this promoted the colonial idea of New Albion as \"the back side of Virginia,\" the expression of England's presumed legal status of sea-to-sea colonial entitlement.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=137}}{{sfn|Anon|2018|p=8}}  The claim occupied a significant place in British geopolitical considerations for centuries and even strengthened Britain's entitlement to the fur trade commerce along the Northwest Coast.{{sfn|Gough|1980|p=148}}  Its final influential assertion came in negotiaing the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] which extended the border of [[Canada]] along the 49th parallel to the Pacific.{{sfn|Gough|1980|pp=16, 123, 125}}\n\n==Site recognition and identification==\n\n===Early identifications===\n\nBeginning in the seventeenth century, maps identify [[Drakes Bay]] as Drake's landing site.{{sfn|Wagner|1926|p=161}} In 1793, [[George Vancouver]] studied the site, and concluded it was in Drakes Bay.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=290}} Professor [[George Davidson (geographer)|George Davidson]], of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], after a study of the narrative and the coast, identified the harbour entered by Drake as Drakes Bay, at Point Reyes, about thirty miles (50&nbsp;km) north of San Francisco. \"Drakes Bay,\" he reported in 1886, \"is a capital harbor in northwest winds, such as Drake encountered. It is easily entered, sheltered by high lands, and a vessel may anchor in three fathoms, close under the shore in good holding ground.\"{{sfn|Davidson|1887|p=214}} Davidson published further support for the Drakes Bay location in 1890 and 1908.{{sfn|Davidson|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Davidson|1908|p=108}}\n\n===Twentieth-century identifications===\n\n[[File:Wpdms usgs photo drakes bay large.jpg|right |thumb |upright=1.0 |Drakes Bay, northwest of [[San Francisco]]]]\n\nIn 1947, following up on work by archaeologists [[Alfred L.

Confirming their work Heizer states that \"Drake must have landed in territory occupied by the [[Coast Miwok]]-speaking natives.\" In his full analysis, Heizer concludes, \"in June 1579, then, Drake probably landed in what is now known as Drake's Bay.\"{{sfn|Heizer|1947|p=15}}\nSince 1949, the theory that Drake landed at Drakes Bay has been advocated by the [[Drake Navigators Guild]] in California, and by former president Captain [[Adolph S. Oko, Jr.]], former honorary chairman [[Chester W. Nimitz]], and former president [[Raymond Aker]]. Oko wrote, \"Many other correlative facts have been ... found true to the Drake's Cove site as part of the ''total body of evidence''. The weight of evidence truly establishes Drake's Cove as the nodal point of Nova Albion.\"{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=152}} Nimitz stated that he did \"not doubt that in time the public will come to recognize the importance and value of this long-lost site, and will rank it with other National Historic Sites such as [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], and [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]].\"{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=150}}  In 1956, Sir Alex A. Cumming, who was the curator of [[Buckland Abbey]], Drake's past home and current museum, also recognised Drake's landing: \"That little cove at the mouth of the Estero, sheltered from the wind, protected from the sea and hidden from hostile eyes, must have been a welcome sight, and I believe that Divine Providence guided him to it.\"{{sfn|Oko|1964|p=150}} In 1978, two time [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] wrote \"...that Drakes Bay is correctly so named, that here he spent five weeks, repaired the ''Golden Hind'', sang songs for the Indians, and marched up country.\"{{sfn|Morison|1978|p=713}} [[File:Porcelain Shards FSCN0763.jpg|thumb|left |Display at Point Reyes National Seashore Visitor Center of Ming porcelain shards from Drake's 1579 landing and Cerme\u00f1o's 1595 Manila galleon shipwreck.

The geography of Drake's Cove, which lies along the coast of [[Marin County, CA|Marin County]], has often been suggested as being similar to the cove described by Drake, including the white cliffs that look like the south coast of England and the specific configuration of the Cove. Responding to questions about the geographical fit of the cove, Aker maintained that criticisms\u2014those based on the inconsistent configuration of the sandbars in the cove\u2014were unfounded. He maintained the configuration of the sandbars in the cove was cyclic over the decades. Accordingly, Aker effectively answered the questions when he predicted that a spit of land that disappeared in 1956\u2014one which closely resembles one on the Hondius map\u2014would reappear. Aker's assertions were confirmed when the spit formed again in 2001.{{sfn|Dell'Osso|2001}}\n\nArtefactual evidence emerged when nearly one hundred pieces of sixteenth-century Chinese porcelain wares were found in the vicinity of the Drake's Cove site which, according to Clarence Shangraw of the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]] and archaeologist [[Edward Von der Porten]], \"must fairly be attributed to Francis Drake's ''Golden Hind'' visit of 1579.\"{{sfn|Shangraw|Von der Porten|1981|p=73}}{{sfn|Pomper|1994|pp=13-14}} These ceramic samples, found at Point Reyes, are the earliest datable archaeological specimens of Chinese porcelains  transported across the Pacific in Manilla galleons.{{sfn|Kuwayama|1997|p=20}} The artefacts were found by four different agencies beginning with the [[University of California]], the Drake Navigators Guild, then the [[Santa Rosa Junior College]], and finally [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]].{{sfn|Kuwayama|1997|p=20}} These porcelain shards are the remains of porcelain dishes Drake took from a Spanish treasure ship in the Pacific.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=268}} Off-loaded during the careening process and abandoned when Drake sailed from Point Reyes, the porcelain wares were the heaviest items of unknown value that he carried.{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Cassels|2003|p=268}}\n\nThe porcelains were first identified by Shangraw and then later by Von der Porten.{{sfn|L.A.

The Drake porcelains have clean breaks and show no abrasion from the abrasive action of being tumbled in the surf. In contrast, the Cerme\u00f1o shards display surf-tumbling, design change, and differences in style and quality\u2014all which suggests two separate cargoes.{{sfn|Meniketti|2013|p=17}} Drake's purloined cargo included fine porcelain dishes from [[Jingdezhen]], [[China]], the industrial centre of finely crafted ceramics.{{sfn|L.A.

Using varied shipwreck sources to provide strong controls to the research, Meniketti's findings support the Cerme\u00f1o porcelains and the Drake ceramics are from two different ships. He states that these two cargoes can be distinguished based on differences in their key elements and believes these differences may represent changes in glaze chemistry, clay sources, or unique inclusions or tempering.{{sfn|Meniketti|2013|p=18}} Aker maintained that those porcelain sherds that washed onto shore must be attributed to Cerme\u00f1o, and those with clean breaks and no water wear must be attributed to Drake.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=290}}\n\n[[File:NPS Plaque IMG 1136.jpg|thumb |right |upright=1.2 |[[National Historic Landmark]] commemorating and honoring Sir Francis Drake, Sebastian Rodriguez Cerme\u00f1o, and Coast Miwok people at Point Reyes, California]]Historian Dr. John Sugden, after reviewing numerous proposed Drake landing sites, observed, \"No aspect of Drake's career has suffered more false leads than the site of Nova Albion.\"  Sugden concludes that \"the evidence overwhelmingly favours Drake's Estero in Drakes Bay\" and that \"it is high time the United States register of National Historic Landmarks officially recognized Drake's Estero as the Elizabethan anchorage.\"{{sfn|Sugden|2006|p=332}}\n\n===Official recognitions===\nThe site of Drake's landing as officially recognised by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] and other agencies is Drake's Cove.

Samuel Bawlf suggested that Drake's landing was on present day [[Vancouver Island]] at [[Comox, British Columbia]] {{nowrap|({{coord|49.66|-124.95|format=dms}}).}} Bawlf supported the idea that Drake careened ''Golden Hind'' in Whale Cove, Oregon, and he pointed to a number of pieces of evidence in support of his view that the official published record of Drake's voyage was deliberately altered to suppress the true extent of his discoveries.{{sfn|Bawlf|2003}}\n\n==Speculation of a colony==\n\nA counting discrepancy of ''Golden Hind'' crew members has led to speculation that Drake left behind men to form a colony.  The idea that Drake formed a colony is, however, suspect\u2014it is improbable that Drake would have left settlers at New Albion since he had not equipped the voyage for colonization. {{sfn|Davis|2013|p=189}}  Drake was also undoubtedly aware that England would have trouble enforcing its claim by supporting a nascent colony in a land so remote as New Albion and would have likely avoided planting such an English outpost. {{sfn|Sugden|2006|pp=118, 137}}  Additionally, the only person specifically reported as left behind at New Albion was [[N. de Morena]], a European [[ship pilot]] who was in ill health. Spanish sources state that he was left ashore, recovered his health, and eventually embarked on a successful four-year journey by walking to Mexico where he reported to authorities. {{sfn|Allen|1997|p=433}}\n\nThe counting discrepancy, a difference of at least 20 men, concerns the number of crew Drake commanded before his stay in Northern California as compared to crew tallies when he reached the [[Moluccas]], an archipelago in the [[Banda Sea]], [[Indonesia]].  Released Spanish prisoners stated that, off the coast of [[Central America]], the ship's company was about 80 men. Sir Francis Drake's cousin and crew member,  [[John Drake (pirate)|John Drake]], claimed the number totaled 60 when the ship was at [[Ternate]] in the Moluccas.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=177}} On Vesuvius Reef, ''The World Encompassed'' puts the number at 58.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=177}}  All notions of an embryo colony are primarily based on these numbers, and the reason for this discrepancy remains unknown.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=177}}\n\n==Plate of Brass hoax==\n{{Main|Drake's Plate of Brass}}\n\nIn the 1900s, a [[hoax]] was perpetrated regarding the brass plate which Drake had posted at New Albion.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}}  English historian [[Richard Hakluyt]] wrote in detail of the distinctive original plate:\n\n{{quote|text=At our departure hence our General set up a monument of our being there, as also of her Majesty's right and title to the same; namely a plate,        nailed upon a fair great post, whereupon was engraved her Majesty's name, the day and year of our arrival there, with the free giving up of the province and people into her Majesty's hands, together with her Highness' picture and arms, in a piece of six pence of current English money, under the plate, whereunder was also written the name of our General.{{sfn|Hakluyt|2015|pp=16-17}}}}\n\nThe original plate\u2014which served as tangible notice of England's sovereignty over the land\u2014has yet to be found.{{sfn|Von_der_Porten|Aker|Allen|Spitze|2002|pp=116-133}}  Consequently, the exact location of the monument erected by Drake is unknown.{{sfn|Turner|2006|p=178}}\n\nIn 1936, a counterfeit, known as [[Drake's Plate of Brass]], came to public attention, and for decades its discovery was widely believed to be that of the original.{{sfn|Von_der_Porten|Aker|Allen|Spitze|2002|pp=116-133}} While accepted as authentic by the [[University of California, Berkeley]], doubts persisted. Eventually, in the late 1970s, the supposed original plate failed a battery of metallurgical tests, and scientists determined that the plate was a modern creation.{{sfn|Craddock|2009|pp=150,151}} In 2003, it was publicly revealed that the counterfeit plate was created as a [[practical joke]] among local historians. Spinning out of control, the joke unintentionally became a public hoax and embarrassment to those who had once confirmed its authenticity.{{sfn|Von_der_Porten|Aker|Allen|Spitze|2002|pp=116-133}}[[File:Artwork in Saint Columba's, Inverness Park, California, showing Episcopal missions at Nova Albion.jpg|thumb|Artwork hanging in Saint Columba's, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and Retreat House in [[Inverness Park]], California, shows the ''Golden Hind'' and Episcopal missions at ''Nova Albion''.]]\n\n==Localised legacy==\n\nThe localised legacy of Drake's New Albion claim is evident in several ways. The inspiration of various local namesakes is owed to the notion of this declaration. [[New Albion Brewing Company]], located near Drake's 1579 landing, is the first United States microbrewery of the modern era, and [[Sir Francis Drake High School]] is located in [[San Anselmo]], California, several miles southeast of Drake's landing.{{sfn|Acitelli|2011}}{{sfn|USGS Geographic Names|2019}} Also near Drake's landing is [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]], an [[arterial road]] running east-west in [[Marin County]], California.{{sfn|Transportation Authority Marin County|2018}}\n\nThe Prayerbook Cross, also known as the Drake Cross, erected in 1894 in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]], was donated by the [[Church of England]] to commemorate the 1579 church services held by Drake's [[chaplain]], claiming they were the first-ever held in English in the region.{{sfn|NY Times|2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Charter of 1606]]\n* [[History of the west coast of North America]]\n* [[Drake in California]]\n* [[Farallon Islands]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/landingdrakesbay00drakrich |title= Sir Francis Drake, description of his landing at Drake's Bay, Marin County, California, June 17, 1579 |first=Francis |last=Drake |editor-first=Hettrich |editor-last= Archibald L.|publisher= San Francisco }}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Allen\n  | first = John Logan\n  | year = 1997\n  | title = North American Exploration, Volume 1: A New World Disclosed\n  | publisher = University of Nebraska Press\n  | location = Lincoln Nebraska\n  | isbn = 978-0803210158\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Anon\n  | year = 2018\n  | title = A Perfect description of Virginia being, a full and true relation of the present state of the plantation, their health, peace, and plenty .
