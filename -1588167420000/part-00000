Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year.

[...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year.

[...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

The watchtowers are the oldest-surviving structures in Alcoy and they are reminders of the Spanish occupation of Cebu Island. They were used to warn the locals that [[Moro pirate|pirates]] were coming. Originally a settlement of Dalaguete, it was founded by the Spaniards in 1880 and was developed into a stop-over station for priests going to Dalaguete. In 1897, via a royal decree, ''Mambahi'' became a municipality and was renamed to Alcoy, after a city in Spain.<ref>https://www.beyondcebu.com/alcoy/</ref>\n\n===Poblacion===\n\nPoblacion is the principal barangay of Alcoy.

In the 12th century, [[Owain Gwynedd]] and his forces retreated to Bryn Dychwelwch, the \"Hill of Retreat\", above Bagillt while being pursued by superior numbers of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s forces.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Castell Hen Blas, a [[motte-and-bailey castle]], lies within the boundaries of Bagillt. It was the birthplace of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]], [[Prince of Wales]], probably around Easter 1212. The castle ruins were partially excavated in the mid-1950s. Dafydd's birth was commemorated by the unveiling of a plaque on the wall of the Upper Shippe Inn in the centre of the village on 25 July 2010; this was 770 years since the issue of his earliest surviving charter as prince.\n\n[[Mostyn Hall]], the seat of one of the oldest [[Mostyn Baronets|Welsh families]], lies close to Bagillt. Parts of the building date from the time of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in the 15th century. The future [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] is said to have been concealed in the Hall by the lord of [[Mostyn]], Richard ap Howel, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. The Hall now houses antiquities and manuscripts pertaining to [[United Kingdom|British]] and Welsh history that were brought from [[Gloddaeth Hall]], [[Llanrhos]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bagillt|volume=3|page=201}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nThe Gadlys Lead Smelting Works was established by Edward Wright and his associates, who were generally Quakers, in 1704. Organised as the [[London Lead Company]], they kept the workshop open until 1799. [[John Freame]], one of the founders of [[Barclays Bank]], was involved in this initiative.<ref name=Meister>[http://www.themeister.co.uk/hindley/freame_john.htm John Freame (1665-1745)] accessed 18 February 2013</ref> \n[[File:Blacksmiths at Bagillt, 1908.JPG|thumb|The blacksmiths in Bagillt, 1908|250px|left]]\nBy the late 18th century, Bagillt had become a [[Mining in Wales|centre of mineral extraction]] and manufacturing. Hundreds of men laboured in eleven [[Coal mining|collieries]] that surrounded the village. There was also a factory and works that produced and refined [[zinc]], [[lead]] and [[iron]].\n\nBagillt already had several quays on the banks of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], where fishing boats had moored for centuries. But by the early 19th century, these had grown into docks where cargo destined for the factories and foundries of England were loaded.\n\nIn 1846, [[navvies]] laying track for the [[North Wales Coast Line]] reached Bagillt. The [[Chester and Holyhead Railway]] officially opened on 1 May 1848. The local mines and works that had used these wharves now switched to haulage by steam train. [[Bagillt railway station]] had extensive sidings and goods yard. It closed in 1966.\n\nIn 1879 a [[working men's club]] and [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]] house was built on the High Street in the Pentre area by public subscription. The building was named the Foresters Hall; it is an impressive three-storey red brick building which is supported by the [http://www.bagillt.org.uk Bagillt Heritage Society]. It was built to promote [[temperance movement|temperance]] and was originally associated with the [[Foresters Friendly Society]]. It was the first cocoa house built in Wales.\n\nBut the industrial age created problems: in 1848, the same year the railway opened, a book was published in London entitled ''[[Treachery of the Blue Books|Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales]]''. It detailed the poverty and hard living of many people in Bagillt and the Flintshire coalfields in the 19th century:<ref>\n{{Citation| title=Reports of the commissioners of inquiry into the state of education in Wales, appointed by the Committee of Council on Education, in pursuance of proceedings in the House of Commons on the motion of Mr. Williams, of March 10, 1846 |pages=[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/great-britain-commissioners-of-inquiry-into-the-s/reports-of-the-commissioners-of-inquiry-into-the-state-of-education-in-wales-ap-hci/page-65-reports-of-the-commissioners-of-inquiry-into-the-state-of-education-in-wales-ap-hci.shtml 532]}}</ref>\n{{quote|\nIn some of the collieries the men are paid every other Saturday, and do not return to their work till the following Tuesday or Wednesday. In Bagillt and in the adjoining town of Flint the old Welsh custom of keeping a merry night (''noswaith lawen'') is still prevalent, and, being generally reserved for a Saturday, is protracted to the following Sunday, during which drinking never ceases. The custom is represented by the clergy and others as involving the most pernicious consequences.\n\nI saw two men stripped and fighting in the main street of Bagillt, with a ring of men, women and children around them. There is no policeman in the township. The women are represented as being for the most part ignorant of housewifery and domestic economy. The girls are very early sent to service, but marry as early as 18, and have large families.\n\nWomen are not employed in or about the mines, but spend most of their time in cockling, or gathering cockles on the beach. They have low ideas of domestic comfort, living in small cottages dirty and ill-ventilated, and at night are crowded together in the same room, and sometimes in the same bed, without regard to age or sex.\n}}\nBagillt remained a hard-working boom town for more than a century. For instance on 31 May 1873, a local newspaper, the ''Wrexham Advertiser'', reported that so many new coal workings had opened near Bagillt that it was becoming difficult to find enough miners to work in them:\n{{quote|\nNo less than four new collieries have been recently started near Mold, and it is becoming a serious question how to get labour to work them, all the men available in the district being already engaged. The [[Coal mining|colliery]] nearest the town on the north side is named ''Hard Struggle'' from the difficulty experienced in obtaining water to get up steam. Another to the east side is named ''Slap Bang'' from the fact that coal has been found near the surface. To the south the ''Linger and Die'' company are doing their best to reduce the price of coal and to enhance that of labour. While to the south east the ''Strip and at it'' company are showing the world how to make the most of it. We hear of numberless other ventures, but these are the principal.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/sites/history/pages/pits.shtml |title='Hard Struggle' - pit names|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=29 January 2009}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn July 1897 work commenced at Boot End, Bagillt, on the huge [[Milwr Tunnel]] which would drain water from the mines working the lead lodes under [[Pentre Halkyn]]. Digging started at a point {{convert|9|ft}} below high-water mark on the Dee foreshore.<ref name=ebbs>{{cite web|author=Ebbs, C.|url=http://sites.google.com/site/flintshireleadmining/modern-exploration|title=Halkyn District United Mines|publisher= Flintshire Lead Mining}}</ref> The tunnel was driven southwest at a gradient of 1:1000. It was brick-lined where it passed through [[coal measures]] and [[shale]] but unlined after the first 1.5 miles where it passed through [[chert]] and [[limestone]]. In 1908 the tunnel was draining more than 1.7 million gallons of water per day through the drainage channel and into the river at Bagillt.<ref name=ebbs/>\n\nBagillt was also the site of the Hawarden Iron Works, situated near the Dee Bank Quay. It was famous for production of a number of [[waterwheel]]s, including the [[Snaefell Wheel]] at [[Laxey]], [[Isle of Man]].\n\nBut by the 1930s the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] had brought hardship and misery to the area as many of the manufacturing works and collieries were closed. Large numbers of people were now out of work and in severe financial hardship. The days of industrial might have ended in Bagillt. The area was now falling into long-term decline. Before the [[Second World War]] many people left in search of work: some moved to cities like [[Cardiff]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] while others went overseas to [[Canada]] and [[United States|America]].<ref name=\"St Mary's Church in Bagillt\">[http://stmarysbagillt.co.uk/ St Mary's Church in Bagillt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052143/http://stmarysbagillt.co.uk/ |date=April 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Present day===\nToday Bagillt and [[Greenfield, Flintshire|Greenfield]] remain areas where unemployment, social deprivation and child poverty are key issues. A report in 2004/05 called ''Flintshire Childcare Sufficiency Assessment'' concluded that child care was needed to help parents. \n{{quote|\nThe Parent Childcare Survey found that 17% of women not in work (6% of all women with children) said that they did not work because they couldn\u2019t find suitable childcare.

In the 12th century, [[Owain Gwynedd]] and his forces retreated to Bryn Dychwelwch, the \"Hill of Retreat\", above Bagillt while being pursued by superior numbers of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s forces.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Castell Hen Blas, a [[motte-and-bailey castle]], lies within the boundaries of Bagillt. It was the birthplace of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]], [[Prince of Wales]], probably around Easter 1212. The castle ruins were partially excavated in the mid-1950s. Dafydd's birth was commemorated by the unveiling of a plaque on the wall of the Upper Shippe Inn in the centre of the village on 25 July 2010; this was 770 years since the issue of his earliest surviving charter as prince.\n\n[[Mostyn Hall]], the seat of one of the oldest [[Mostyn Baronets|Welsh families]], lies close to Bagillt. Parts of the building date from the time of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in the 15th century. The future [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] is said to have been concealed in the Hall by the lord of [[Mostyn]], Richard ap Howel, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. The Hall now houses antiquities and manuscripts pertaining to [[United Kingdom|British]] and Welsh history that were brought from [[Gloddaeth Hall]], [[Llanrhos]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bagillt|volume=3|page=201}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nThe Gadlys Lead Smelting Works was established by Edward Wright and his associates, who were generally Quakers, in 1704. Organised as the [[London Lead Company]], they kept the workshop open until 1799. [[John Freame]], one of the founders of [[Barclays Bank]], was involved in this initiative.<ref name=Meister>[http://www.themeister.co.uk/hindley/freame_john.htm John Freame (1665-1745)] accessed 18 February 2013</ref> \n[[File:Blacksmiths at Bagillt, 1908.JPG|thumb|The blacksmiths in Bagillt, 1908|250px|left]]\nBy the late 18th century, Bagillt had become a [[Mining in Wales|centre of mineral extraction]] and manufacturing. Hundreds of men laboured in eleven [[Coal mining|collieries]] that surrounded the village. There was also a factory and works that produced and refined [[zinc]], [[lead]] and [[iron]].\n\nBagillt already had several quays on the banks of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], where fishing boats had moored for centuries. But by the early 19th century, these had grown into docks where cargo destined for the factories and foundries of England were loaded.\n\nIn 1846, [[navvies]] laying track for the [[North Wales Coast Line]] reached Bagillt. The [[Chester and Holyhead Railway]] officially opened on 1 May 1848. The local mines and works that had used these wharves now switched to haulage by steam train. [[Bagillt railway station]] had extensive sidings and goods yard. It closed in 1966.\n\nIn 1879 a [[working men's club]] and [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]] house was built on the High Street in the Pentre area by public subscription. The building was named the Foresters Hall; it is an impressive three-storey red brick building which is supported by the [http://www.bagillt.org.uk Bagillt Heritage Society]. It was built to promote [[temperance movement|temperance]] and was originally associated with the [[Foresters Friendly Society]]. It was the first cocoa house built in Wales.\n\nBut the industrial age created problems: in 1848, the same year the railway opened, a book was published in London entitled ''[[Treachery of the Blue Books|Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales]]''. It detailed the poverty and hard living of many people in Bagillt and the Flintshire coalfields in the 19th century:<ref>\n{{Citation| title=Reports of the commissioners of inquiry into the state of education in Wales, appointed by the Committee of Council on Education, in pursuance of proceedings in the House of Commons on the motion of Mr. Williams, of March 10, 1846 |pages=[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/great-britain-commissioners-of-inquiry-into-the-s/reports-of-the-commissioners-of-inquiry-into-the-state-of-education-in-wales-ap-hci/page-65-reports-of-the-commissioners-of-inquiry-into-the-state-of-education-in-wales-ap-hci.shtml 532]}}</ref>\n{{quote|\nIn some of the collieries the men are paid every other Saturday, and do not return to their work till the following Tuesday or Wednesday. In Bagillt and in the adjoining town of Flint the old Welsh custom of keeping a merry night (''noswaith lawen'') is still prevalent, and, being generally reserved for a Saturday, is protracted to the following Sunday, during which drinking never ceases. The custom is represented by the clergy and others as involving the most pernicious consequences.\n\nI saw two men stripped and fighting in the main street of Bagillt, with a ring of men, women and children around them. There is no policeman in the township. The women are represented as being for the most part ignorant of housewifery and domestic economy. The girls are very early sent to service, but marry as early as 18, and have large families.\n\nWomen are not employed in or about the mines, but spend most of their time in cockling, or gathering cockles on the beach. They have low ideas of domestic comfort, living in small cottages dirty and ill-ventilated, and at night are crowded together in the same room, and sometimes in the same bed, without regard to age or sex.\n}}\nBagillt remained a hard-working boom town for more than a century. For instance on 31 May 1873, a local newspaper, the ''Wrexham Advertiser'', reported that so many new coal workings had opened near Bagillt that it was becoming difficult to find enough miners to work in them:\n{{quote|\nNo less than four new collieries have been recently started near Mold, and it is becoming a serious question how to get labour to work them, all the men available in the district being already engaged. The [[Coal mining|colliery]] nearest the town on the north side is named ''Hard Struggle'' from the difficulty experienced in obtaining water to get up steam. Another to the east side is named ''Slap Bang'' from the fact that coal has been found near the surface. To the south the ''Linger and Die'' company are doing their best to reduce the price of coal and to enhance that of labour. While to the south east the ''Strip and at it'' company are showing the world how to make the most of it. We hear of numberless other ventures, but these are the principal.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/sites/history/pages/pits.shtml |title='Hard Struggle' - pit names|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=29 January 2009}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn July 1897 work commenced at Boot End, Bagillt, on the huge [[Milwr Tunnel]] which would drain water from the mines working the lead lodes under [[Pentre Halkyn]]. Digging started at a point {{convert|9|ft}} below high-water mark on the Dee foreshore.<ref name=ebbs>{{cite web|author=Ebbs, C.|url=http://sites.google.com/site/flintshireleadmining/modern-exploration|title=Halkyn District United Mines|publisher= Flintshire Lead Mining}}</ref> The tunnel was driven southwest at a gradient of 1:1000. It was brick-lined where it passed through [[coal measures]] and [[shale]] but unlined after the first 1.5 miles where it passed through [[chert]] and [[limestone]]. In 1908 the tunnel was draining more than 1.7 million gallons of water per day through the drainage channel and into the river at Bagillt.<ref name=ebbs/>\n\nBagillt was also the site of the Hawarden Iron Works, situated near the Dee Bank Quay. It was famous for production of a number of [[waterwheel]]s, including the [[Snaefell Wheel]] at [[Laxey]], [[Isle of Man]].\n\nBut by the 1930s the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] had brought hardship and misery to the area as many of the manufacturing works and collieries were closed. Large numbers of people were now out of work and in severe financial hardship. The days of industrial might have ended in Bagillt. The area was now falling into long-term decline. Before the [[Second World War]] many people left in search of work: some moved to cities like [[Cardiff]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] while others went overseas to [[Canada]] and [[United States|America]].<ref name=\"St Mary's Church in Bagillt\">[http://stmarysbagillt.co.uk/ St Mary's Church in Bagillt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052143/http://stmarysbagillt.co.uk/ |date=April 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Present day===\nToday Bagillt and [[Greenfield, Flintshire|Greenfield]] remain areas where unemployment, social deprivation and child poverty are key issues.
