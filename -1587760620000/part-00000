The winner is crowned at the conclusion of the final competition. The pageant has been held since 1955 and is responsible for selecting the country's representatives to [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss International]] (among others). The winner goes to Miss Universe and the first runner-up to Miss International. Since 2018 Miss Nicaragua only franchised the Miss Universe pageant and in 2019 Miss Charm International.\n\n==Participants==\nParticipants for the Miss Nicaragua contest must be between 18 and 28 years old, not married, and have no children. After participants are chosen, 16 candidates are elected and represent their region. The majority of Miss Nicaragua winners have been from [[Managua]].\n\nSome years, the pageant has had a theme; for 2006, it was ''\"Le\u00f3n, pasado maravilloso... presente esperanzador... futuro luminoso\"'' meaning \"Le\u00f3n, wonderful past... hopeful present.. luminous future\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103022904/http://www.missnicaragua.com/2007/Noticias/noticias07.html|title=Miss Nicaragua|date=January 3, 2007|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nDespite only having had only three Miss Universe semi-finalists to date, Nicaragua has done well in other international beauty pageants.\n\n[[Image:MissNicaragua.jpg|thumb|right|420px|Cristiana Frixione at the Miss Nicaragua 2007 contest held in the [[Teatro Nacional Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo|Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo National Theater]] in Managua on March 17, 2007]]\n\n==Titleholders==\n{| class=\"sortable\" border=\"5\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

It is located and comprises the majority of the [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] suburb, between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]] and [[Darling Harbour]]. It is part of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Sydney]] and is Australia's largest [[Chinatown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/sydney-city/chinatown-and-haymarket|title=Chinatown and Haymarket|publisher=Sydney.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nSydney and the colony of New South Wales experienced Chinese migration as early as 1828. The first group of Chinese labourers from [[Xiamen|Amoy (modern day Xiamen)]] embarked for [[New South Wales]] in 1848. With the [[Australian gold rushes|discovery of gold]] in 1851, Chinese immigration increased and by 1855, the number of Chinese immigrants reached 17,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/stories/chinese-migration-stories|title=Chinese Migration Stories|date=2015-12-22|website=www.records.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> The Chinese population had traditionally been represented by those who came from Southern China (i.e. provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian) due to the majority of colonial ports being located in the southern coast of China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arrow.latrobe.edu.au/store/3/4/5/5/1/public/education/history.htm|title=Chinese Heritage of Australian Federation Project|website=arrow.latrobe.edu.au|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n{{See|History of Sydney|History of Chinese Australians}}\nOne of the many nationalities to arrive in Australia in the Gold Rush years of the 1850s were the Chinese. Large groups stayed after the Gold Rush years ended. Many settled in their own communities, working in locations across Sydney. Some of these Chinese immigrants became gardener's on the city's fringe.<ref name=\"Sharpe\">{{cite book|title=City of Sydney: Pictorial History|first=Alan|last=Sharpe|year=2000|publisher=Kingsclear Books|isbn=9-780-98718408-5}}</ref> By 1861 there were some 13,000 Chinese living in New South Wales, during this time the Chinatown was in [[The Rocks, Sydney|The Rocks]] district, also known as the 'Chinese Quarter'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/events/sydneys-chinese-community-rocks|title=Sydney\u2019s Chinese Community in The Rocks|last=deborahw|date=2014-02-21|website=Sydney Living Museums|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Anti-immigration sentiment was rife during the 1880s and a [[Royal Commissions Act 1902|Royal Commission]] into \"Alleged Chinese Gambling and Immorality\" began in 1892, due to the amount of [[opium dens]] and [[brothels]] that were found in the area, similar to [[Chinatown, Melbourne|Melbourne's Chinatown]]. This attitude of negativity towards the Chinese had settled down by the time of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901. By the 1920s, Sydney's Chinatown migrated over to Campbell Street, and was then placed with the [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]].\n\nSince 2019, Dixon Street and other intersecting streets are completely vehicle-free every Friday from 4pm in order to host the Friday night markets. Different stands selling Asian street food, desserts, and confectionary line the streets and alleys and the markets can become extremely busy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/sydney/shopping/chinatown-night-market-1|title=Chinatown Night Market {{!}} Dixon Street Plaza {{!}} Shopping in Sydney|website=Time Out Sydney|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n\n=== Traditional boundaries ===\nOfficially, Chinatown does not have clearly defined borders, due to its continuous growth. The traditional core of the Haymarket Chinatown has been centred around Dixon Street, a pedestrian street mall with many Chinese restaurants, and with a [[paifang]] (a traditional Chinese gateway) at each end. At the eastern side, running parallel with Dixon Street, are [[Sussex Street, Sydney|Sussex Street]] and [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], Sydney city's main thoroughfare. Other streets and lanes within Sydney's Chinatown include Factory Street, [[Goulburn Street]], Little Hay Street, Kimber Lane and Thomas Street.\n\nAt the eastern end of Chinatown, at the corner of George Street and Hay Street, there is a sculpture made from a dead tree trunk; created by artist Lin Li in 1999 and named ''Golden Water Mouth''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Water Mouth|work=cityartsydney.com.au ([[City of Sydney]] website)|url=https://www.cityartsydney.com.au/artwork/golden-water-mouth/https://www.cityartsydney.com.au/artwork/golden-water-mouth/|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> Its designer believed that it would [[Feng Shui|bring good fortune]] to the Chinese community.\n\n=== Recent expansion ===\nThe current location of modern day Chinatown is actually the third known area to have been considered a Chinatown.{{where?|date=April 2020}} When Sydney's produce market moved from what became the site of the [[Queen Victoria Building]] to the Belmore Markets, the Haymarket and [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] areas became the focus for Sydney's Chinese citizens. By the 1920s Chinatown began to consolidate at its current location.<ref name=\"Sharpe\" />[[File:Haymarket Market City.JPG|left|thumb|The Peak Apartments building on top of the Market City shopping centre.|alt=|283x283px]]On Hay Street, the construction of [[List of tallest buildings in Sydney|The Peak Apartments]], a residential skyscraper, in 1996 and the newly renovated Market City shopping complex built over the Paddy's Market further consolidated Chinatown. Market City contains food courts with chain restaurants (such as [[Haidilao]]), an 800+ seat Dim Sum Restaurant (''The Eight Modern Chinese Restaurant''), boutique shops, City Amusements (a large indoor entertainment complex), and the Haymarket [[Paddy's Markets]], a Wednesday-to-Sunday produce and [[flea market]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketcity.com.au/|title=Market City Sydney {{!}} Best Shopping in Chinatown & Haymarket|website=Market City|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Likewise, the completion of Darling Square in late 2017 adjacent to Market City added multiple new apartment complexes and a plethora of new facilities and restaurants that fully integrated Chinatown into the urban core of Sydney.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commercialrealestate.com.au/news/darling-square-sydneys-new-3-4-billion-neighbourhood-takes-shape-7754/|title=Darling Square: Sydney's new $3.4 billion neighbourhood takes shape|last=Williams|first=Sue|date=2019-04-16|website=Commercial Real Estate|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the Chinatowns in some other countries, Sydney's Chinatown has been relatively free of crime and hygiene issues. However, since there are many [[skyscraper]]s in [[Sydney]], there are some concerns within the Chinese community about the building height restrictions imposed by the image-conscious local government authorities.\n\n=== Suburbification ===\nThere are also satellite Chinatowns that have emerged in the past two decades in several Sydney suburbs such as [[Cabramatta]], [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], [[Hurstville]], [[Eastwood, New South Wales|Eastwood]], [[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]], [[Parramatta]], [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], [[Flemington, New South Wales|Flemington]] and [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]]. Each of these suburbs are increasingly diverse in that people from specific regions in China settle together in one suburb, traditionally known as an [[ethnic enclave]]. For example, Ashfield is known as 'little Shanghai'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/business-booms-in-little-shanghai-20110620-1gbey.html|title=Business booms in 'little Shanghai'|date=2011-06-17|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> whilst Hurstville has a high concentration of people from Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2014/09/22/neighbourhood-hurtsville|title=In the neighbourhood: Hurtsville|website=Food|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> However, Sydney's Chinatown still remains both a social and cultural centre for the [[Chinese Australian]] community in Sydney as it continues to expand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/06/1031115933806.html|title=Eastern promise spreads to the suburbs|date=2002-09-06|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Chinese New Year Parade in Chinatown Sydney.jpg|thumb|263x263px|Chinese New Year parade]]\nAccording to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], in 2016 the Chinatown and Haymarket area included a significant population of Chinese (31.9%), Thai (18.3%), Indonesian (5.6%), English (5.1%) and Korean (4.8%) population.

The relationship between [[Sydney]] and [[Guangzhou|Guangzhou (previously Romanized as Canton)]], the capital of [[Guangdong]] province, is particularly strong because of trade and migration since the earliest days of colonisation. The agreement stipulated [[Guangdong]] would provide the design of the garden and key building materials, furniture and artworks that are intrinsic to the classic garden typology, while New South Wales would manage and fund its construction through the Darling Harbour Authority.\nIt is one of the few public traditional Chinese gardens outside of China and is a horticultural expression of a private garden and can also be classified as a scholar's or classical garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darlingharbour.com/sydney-Things_To_Do-Chinese_Garden.htm|title=Chinese Garden of Friendship|publisher=Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority|accessdate=6 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602073906/http://www.darlingharbour.com/sydney-Things_To_Do-Chinese_Garden.htm|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The gardens were added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 5 October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=5061920|title=Chinese Garden of Friendship {{!}} NSW Environment, Energy and Science|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> The garden hosts activities such as lessons on its history and design philosophy, landscape tours, school visits, wedding functions, koi fish feeding, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://darlingharbour.com/things-to-do/chinese-garden-of-friendship/|title=Chinese Garden of Friendship|website=darlingharbour.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Bilingual street signs ==\n \nThere are many bilingual street signs across Chinatown, denoting the name of streets, lanes, and roads in both English and Chinese. Interestingly, some of the names are based off their Cantonese pronunciation (e.g. Hay Street, which is pronounced ''\"hei1 gaai1\"'' in Cantonese, but ''\"x\u01d0 ji\u0113\"'' in Mandarin\") whilst others are based off their Mandarin pronunciation (e.g. Liverpool Street, which is pronounced ''\"l\u00ecw\u00f9p\u016d ji\u0113\"'' in Mandarin, but \"''lei6mat6pou2 gaai1\"'' in Cantonese). \n\nSome of these signs are accompanied by their official [[City of Sydney]] street signs.

It is located and comprises the majority of the [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] suburb, between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]] and [[Darling Harbour]].

The first group of Chinese labourers from [[Xiamen|Amoy (modern day Xiamen)]] embarked for [[New South Wales]] in 1848. With the [[Australian gold rushes|discovery of gold]] in 1851, Chinese immigration increased and by 1855, the number of Chinese immigrants reached 17,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/stories/chinese-migration-stories|title=Chinese Migration Stories|date=2015-12-22|website=www.records.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> The Chinese population had traditionally been represented by those who came from Southern China (i.e. provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian) due to the majority of colonial ports being located in the southern coast of China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arrow.latrobe.edu.au/store/3/4/5/5/1/public/education/history.htm|title=Chinese Heritage of Australian Federation Project|website=arrow.latrobe.edu.au|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n{{See|History of Sydney|History of Chinese Australians}}\nOne of the many nationalities to arrive in Australia in the Gold Rush years of the 1850s were the Chinese. Large groups stayed after the Gold Rush years ended. Many settled in their own communities, working in locations across Sydney. Some of these Chinese immigrants became gardener's on the city's fringe.<ref name=\"Sharpe\">{{cite book|title=City of Sydney: Pictorial History|first=Alan|last=Sharpe|year=2000|publisher=Kingsclear Books|isbn=9-780-98718408-5}}</ref> By 1861 there were some 13,000 Chinese living in New South Wales, during this time the Chinatown was in [[The Rocks, Sydney|The Rocks]] district, also known as the 'Chinese Quarter'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/events/sydneys-chinese-community-rocks|title=Sydney\u2019s Chinese Community in The Rocks|last=deborahw|date=2014-02-21|website=Sydney Living Museums|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Anti-immigration sentiment was rife during the 1880s and a [[Royal Commissions Act 1902|Royal Commission]] into \"Alleged Chinese Gambling and Immorality\" began in 1892, due to the amount of [[opium dens]] and [[brothels]] that were found in the area, similar to [[Chinatown, Melbourne|Melbourne's Chinatown]]. This attitude of negativity towards the Chinese had settled down by the time of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901. By the 1920s, Sydney's Chinatown migrated over to Campbell Street, and was then placed with the [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]].\n\nSince 2019, Dixon Street and other intersecting streets are completely vehicle-free every Friday from 4pm in order to host the Friday night markets. Different stands selling Asian street food, desserts, and confectionary line the streets and alleys and the markets can become extremely busy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/sydney/shopping/chinatown-night-market-1|title=Chinatown Night Market {{!}} Dixon Street Plaza {{!}} Shopping in Sydney|website=Time Out Sydney|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n\n=== Traditional boundaries ===\nOfficially, Chinatown does not have clearly defined borders, due to its continuous growth. The traditional core of the Haymarket Chinatown has been centred around Dixon Street, a pedestrian street mall with many Chinese restaurants, and with a [[paifang]] (a traditional Chinese gateway) at each end. At the eastern side, running parallel with Dixon Street, are [[Sussex Street, Sydney|Sussex Street]] and [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], Sydney city's main thoroughfare. Other streets and lanes within Sydney's Chinatown include Factory Street, [[Goulburn Street]], Little Hay Street, Kimber Lane and Thomas Street.\n\nAt the eastern end of Chinatown, at the corner of George Street and Hay Street, there is a sculpture made from a dead tree trunk; created by artist Lin Li in 1999 and named ''Golden Water Mouth''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Water Mouth|work=cityartsydney.com.au ([[City of Sydney]] website)|url=https://www.cityartsydney.com.au/artwork/golden-water-mouth/https://www.cityartsydney.com.au/artwork/golden-water-mouth/|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> Its designer believed that it would [[Feng Shui|bring good fortune]] to the Chinese community.\n\n=== Recent expansion ===\nThe current location of modern day Chinatown is actually the third known area to have been considered a Chinatown.{{where?|date=April 2020}} When Sydney's produce market moved from what became the site of the [[Queen Victoria Building]] to the Belmore Markets, the Haymarket and [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] areas became the focus for Sydney's Chinese citizens. By the 1920s Chinatown began to consolidate at its current location.<ref name=\"Sharpe\" />[[File:Haymarket Market City.JPG|left|thumb|The Peak Apartments building on top of the Market City shopping centre.|alt=|283x283px]]On Hay Street, the construction of [[List of tallest buildings in Sydney|The Peak Apartments]], a residential skyscraper, in 1996 and the newly renovated Market City shopping complex built over the Paddy's Market further consolidated Chinatown. Market City contains food courts with chain restaurants (such as [[Haidilao]]), an 800+ seat Dim Sum Restaurant (''The Eight Modern Chinese Restaurant''), boutique shops, City Amusements (a large indoor entertainment complex), and the Haymarket [[Paddy's Markets]], a Wednesday-to-Sunday produce and [[flea market]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketcity.com.au/|title=Market City Sydney {{!}} Best Shopping in Chinatown & Haymarket|website=Market City|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Likewise, the completion of Darling Square in late 2017 adjacent to Market City added multiple new apartment complexes and a plethora of new facilities and restaurants that fully integrated Chinatown into the urban core of Sydney.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commercialrealestate.com.au/news/darling-square-sydneys-new-3-4-billion-neighbourhood-takes-shape-7754/|title=Darling Square: Sydney's new $3.4 billion neighbourhood takes shape|last=Williams|first=Sue|date=2019-04-16|website=Commercial Real Estate|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the Chinatowns in some other countries, Sydney's Chinatown has been relatively free of crime and hygiene issues. However, since there are many [[skyscraper]]s in [[Sydney]], there are some concerns within the Chinese community about the building height restrictions imposed by the image-conscious local government authorities.\n\n=== Suburbification ===\nThere are also satellite Chinatowns that have emerged in the past two decades in several Sydney suburbs such as [[Cabramatta]], [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], [[Hurstville]], [[Eastwood, New South Wales|Eastwood]], [[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]], [[Parramatta]], [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], [[Flemington, New South Wales|Flemington]] and [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]]. Each of these suburbs are increasingly diverse in that people from specific regions in China settle together in one suburb, traditionally known as an [[ethnic enclave]]. For example, Ashfield is known as 'little Shanghai'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/business-booms-in-little-shanghai-20110620-1gbey.html|title=Business booms in 'little Shanghai'|date=2011-06-17|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> whilst Hurstville has a high concentration of people from Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2014/09/22/neighbourhood-hurtsville|title=In the neighbourhood: Hurtsville|website=Food|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> However, Sydney's Chinatown still remains both a social and cultural centre for the [[Chinese Australian]] community in Sydney as it continues to expand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/06/1031115933806.html|title=Eastern promise spreads to the suburbs|date=2002-09-06|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Chinese New Year Parade in Chinatown Sydney.jpg|thumb|263x263px|Chinese New Year parade]]\nAccording to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], in 2016 the Chinatown and Haymarket area included a significant population of Chinese (31.9%), Thai (18.3%), Indonesian (5.6%), English (5.1%) and Korean (4.8%) population.

The relationship between [[Sydney]] and [[Guangzhou|Guangzhou (previously Romanized as Canton)]], the capital of [[Guangdong]] province, is particularly strong because of trade and migration since the earliest days of colonisation.

Interestingly, some of the names are based off their Cantonese pronunciation (e.g. Hay Street, which is pronounced ''\"hei1 gaai1\"'' in Cantonese, but ''\"x\u01d0 ji\u0113\"'' in Mandarin\") whilst others are based off their Mandarin pronunciation (e.g. Liverpool Street, which is pronounced ''\"l\u00ecw\u00f9p\u016d ji\u0113\"'' in Mandarin, but \"''lei6mat6pou2 gaai1\"'' in Cantonese). \n\nSome of these signs are accompanied by their official [[City of Sydney]] street signs.
