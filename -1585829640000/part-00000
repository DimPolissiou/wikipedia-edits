Miller coaches fighters in [[Irvine, California]] at Mayhem Martial Arts and has trained extensively with Kings MMA in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. He has fought in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], [[World Fighting Alliance|WFA]], [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]] and [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]]. In his career, Miller beat [[Robbie Lawler]], [[Tim Kennedy (fighter)|Tim Kennedy]], [[Denis Kang]] and [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundhawaii.com/lifestyle/around_town/2009-03-monkeying-around-with-jason-mayhem-miller.html|title=Monkeying Around with Jason \"Mayhem\" Miller|author=Edward Sugimoto|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507191909/http://www.aroundhawaii.com/lifestyle/around_town/2009-03-monkeying-around-with-jason-mayhem-miller.html|archivedate=2009-05-07}}</ref> Miller was the host of [[MTV]]'s reality series ''[[Bully Beatdown]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2010/02/source-mtvs-bully-beatdown-host-jason-miller-renewed-for-third-season|title=Source: MTV's \"Bully Beatdown,\" host Jason Miller renewed for third season|date=2010-02-24|website=MMA Junkie|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMiller was born in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], and he grew up in [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]]. Miller's father was an [[82nd Airborne]] [[paratrooper]] in the [[United States Army]]. After Miller was expelled from high school for fighting, he and his family had to move 40 miles so that he could go to school in a new district. Miller knew he wanted to compete professionally. He earned his yellow belt in [[Taekwondo]] at age 11 and joined his new High school's [[wrestling]] team and would challenge the instructors of [[karate]] schools to spar. He was guided by a [[judo]] instructor to attend one of the first [[mixed martial arts]] schools. Miller had his first fight in [[Virginia Beach]] when he was 17 years old, against 27-year-old Al \"Superman\" Dill. Miller won the fight and officially began his MMA career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/10/20/my-first-fight-mayhem-miller|title=My First Fight: 'Mayhem' Miller|author=Ben Fowlkes|date=20 October 2011|work=MMA Fighting|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nAfter his submission win over [[Ronald Jhun]], earning Miller his first Superbrawl Championship, a riot broke out and Miller was punched in the back of the head by a fellow fighter, Mark Moreno.<ref name=\"lockflow.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060629101523/http://www.lockflow.com/article_view.php?id=184]</ref> This set the stage for a grudge match, and Miller dominated Moreno, finishing him with an [[armbar]] at the end of round one making the [[shaka sign]] before finishing him.\n\nOn September 2, 2006, Mayhem won the Icon Sport Middleweight title from [[Robbie Lawler]] in a back and forth battle. After being staggered and nearly finished by Lawler, Mayhem secured an [[arm triangle choke]] and won in the third round. In December of the same year, Mayhem lost his first title defense to [[Frank Trigg]] via [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the second round, a fight many thought he was the favorite to win.\n\nMayhem stepped into the [[Dream 4]] tournament on short notice and scored an impressive win in the semifinals, he was eliminated by [[Ronaldo Souza]] in the quarterfinals. Miller lost a [[unanimous decision]] to \"Jacare\" in a fast-paced grappling style bout that saw him escape submission after submission.\n\nAfter back and forth battles of words on Japanese, Brazilian and American media, Miller and Souza fought again, but this time for the Dream Middleweight belt. (the title was vacant as [[Gegard Mousasi]] moved to the Light Heavyweight division). The fight ended in a no-contest when Miller landed a [[soccer kick]] to Souza's forehead (formerly a legal strike, but had been outlawed), which opened a large gash and prompted a doctor stoppage. Both fighters agreed to face each other in an event in September 2009. The match was canceled after Souza signed with the [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Ronaldo-Jacare-Souza-signs-with-Strikeforce.html|title=Five Knuckles|accessdate=22 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807055616/http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Ronaldo-Jacare-Souza-signs-with-Strikeforce.html|archivedate=7 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nMiller fought Jake Shields on November 7, 2009 on [[CBS]] as a part of [[Strikeforce: Fedor vs Rogers]]. The fight was for the Strikeforce Middleweight Championship as [[Cung Le]] stepped down as champion. After a brief punching exchange that staggered Shields, the fight was mostly grappling, Miller lost via unanimous decision (48\u201347, 49\u201346, and 49\u201346). The closest the match came to ending was in the third round when Miller secured a [[rear naked choke]] on Shields, but time ended before Shields tapped out.\n\nMayhem fought Tim Stout at [[Strikeforce: Nashville]] on April 17, 2010 and won the fight by with a [[ground and pound]] TKO at 1:47 of the first round.\n\nMiller was expected to face Robbie Lawler on June 16, 2010 at [[Strikeforce: Los Angeles]], but was removed from the card after the Tennessee Athletic Commission suspended him for his part in the Nashville Brawl. After Shields' win over [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] veteran and former [[Pride FC]] Welterweight and Middlweight Champion [[Dan Henderson]], Mayhem confronted Jake Shields for a title rematch. Although Jake was not surprised, [[Nick Diaz]], [[Nate Diaz]], and the rest of Team [[Gracie family|Gracie]] fought with Miller in the cage, prompting [[CBS]] announcer [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] to say \"Gentlemen, we are on national television.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Lawler-Sobral-Set-for-June-16-Strikeforce-Expects-Mayhem-To-Be-Suspended-24151|title=Lawler-Sobral Set for June 16; Strikeforce Expects 'Mayhem' To Be Suspended|author=Loretta Hunt}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Mayhem aggressively called out [[Nick Diaz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o864hZ5lAuM |title=Joe Rogan & Mayhem Miller talk more Strikeforce, UFC, and Bully Beatdown! |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> the bout never materialized.

He would go on to do just that, and win the fight via arm triangle choke.\n\nOn April 22, 2011, Miller announced via Twitter that he had signed a multi-fight deal with the UFC due to his Strikeforce contract expiring.<ref>{{cite web|last=Helwani |first=Ariel |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/04/22/jason-mayhem-miller-signs-with-ufc/ |title=Jason 'Mayhem' Miller Signs With UFC |publisher=MMA Fighting |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref>\n\n===Strikeforce: Nashville brawl===\nOn April 17, 2010, following [[Jake Shields]]' victory over [[Dan Henderson]], Miller entered the cage, without proper approval, during Shields' post-fight interview. During that interview, Mayhem interrupted Shields and asked \"Where's my rematch, buddy?\" [[Gilbert Melendez]] and Shields responded by pushing Miller away, and [[Nick Diaz]] then threw a punch at Miller which started a brawl. Members of the Cesar Gracie Jiu-Jitsu camp, including Melendez, Nick and [[Nate Diaz]], attacked Miller while he was held down on the canvas by other members of the Gracie camp. The fight was eventually broken up by referees, members of Dan Henderson's corner and the promoter's security personnel.\nMiller and five other participants in the brawl were each given three-month suspensions, and fines ranging between $5,000 and $7,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Coker-on-King-Mo-Babalu-Stalemate-International-Shows-135-Womens-Tourney-Kharitonov-Signing-and-More-25162|title=Coker on King Mo-Babalu Stalemate, International Shows, 135 Women's Tourney, Kharitonov Signing and More|author=Loretta Hunt}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of the Nashville Brawl, Miller expressed an interest in fighting Nick Diaz. The 170&nbsp;lb Diaz refused stating he was the Strikeforce Welterweight Champion and needed to continue to fight at that weight. He requested Miller move down to 170&nbsp;lb to fight him. Miller continued to attempt to set up a fight, offering 183&nbsp;lb as a catchweight. Diaz counter-offered a catchweight of 181&nbsp;lb. Scott Coker, CEO of Strikeforce was interested in setting up the fight, but failed to do so as Zuffa took over Strikeforce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/06/15/scott-coker-thinks-nick-diaz-vs-mayhem-miller-will-happen-withi|title=Scott Coker Thinks Nick Diaz vs. Mayhem Miller Will Happen Within Year|author=Ariel Helwani|date=15 June 2010|work=MMA Fighting|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the UFC===\nOn April 22, 2011, Miller signed a multi-fight agreement with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/04/22/jason-mayhem-miller-signs-with-ufc/|title=Jason 'Mayhem' Miller Signs With UFC|author=Ariel Helwani}}</ref>\n\nMiller was expected to face [[Aaron Simpson (fighter)|Aaron Simpson]] on July 2, 2011 at UFC 132.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/jason-mayhem-miller-faces-aaron-simpson-in-his-return-at-ufc-132-in-july|title=Jason \"Mayhem\" Miller faces Aaron Simpson in his return at UFC 132 in July|publisher=MMA Weekly|date=April 23, 2011}}</ref> However, on May 27, 2011, it was revealed that Miller would be one of the coaches of [[The Ultimate Fighter 14|The Ultimate Fighter Season 14]], opposite to [[Michael Bisping]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/23764/report-the-ultimate-fighter-14-coaches-michael-bisping-and-mayhem-miller.mma|title=\"The Ultimate Fighter 14\" coaches?

Dollaway]] on May 26, 2012 at [[UFC 146]]. After dropping Dollaway with a right hand, Miller appeared to injure his left knee. He was taken down for the rest of the fight and lost via unanimous decision (29\u201328, 30\u201326, and 29\u201328). Mayhem had very publicly stated on his Twitter page that if he lost the fight, he would retire.\n\nOne day following the loss, [[Dana White]] ignored Miller's statement of retirement, instead opting to publicly fire Miller.

The felony [[vandalism]] charge itself carried a maximum penalty of eight months in jail, but between this particular incident, prior convictions, and a probation violation, Miller faced up to 23 years in a California state prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-mayhem-miller-20181025-story.html|title=Former MMA fighter Jason 'Mayhem' Miller arrested again on vandalism charges|work=latimes.com|date=October 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/10/23/18017452/mayhem-miller-arrested-for-felony-vandalism-in-danger-of-facing-jail-sentence|title='Mayhem' Miller arrested for felony vandalism, in danger of facing jail sentence|work=mmafighting.com|date=October 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 2019, it was reported that Miller had accepted a [[plea bargain|plea deal]] in the felony vandalism case, and he was sentenced to serve one year in jail with time served being credited.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/ufc-strikeforce-veteran-jason-mayhem-miller-gets-jail-time-with-guilty-plea/amp/|title=UFC, Strikeforce veteran Jason 'Mayhem' Miller gets jail time with guilty plea|work=BJPenn.com|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n\n===Mixed Martial Art===\n* '''Icon Sport'''\n** Middleweight Championship (One time)\n* '''Superbrawl'''\n** Welterweight Championship (One time)\n** North American Welterweight Championship (One time; First)\n*'''International Sport Combat Federation'''\n**ISCF East Coast Middleweight Championship (One time; First)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscfmma.com/ISCFChamps.htm |title=ISCF Past Champions |publisher=Iscfmma.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}</ref>\n* '''World MMA Awards'''\n** Most Memorable Ring Entrance 2010 & 2009\n\n===Submission wrestling===\n* '''Grapplers Quest Champion 2001, 2003, 2004\n** Best in the West Champion 2003\n\n==Mixed martial arts record==\n{{MMArecordbox\n| draws= \n| nc= 1\n| ko-wins= 6\n| ko-losses= 2\n| sub-wins= 14\n| sub-losses= 2\n| dec-wins= 8\n| dec-losses= 6\n| dq-wins= \n| dq-losses= \n| other-wins= \n| other-losses= \n}}\n{{MMA record start}}\n|-\n|{{no2}}Loss\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 28\u201310 (1)\n| Mattia Schiavolin\n| Submission (rear-naked choke)\n| Venator FC3\n| {{dts|2016|May|21}} \n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 3:10\n| [[Milan]], Italy\n| {{small|Catchweight (207 lbs) bout; Miller missed weight.}}\n|-\n| {{no2}}Loss\n| align=center| 28\u20139 (1)\n| [[C.B.

He has fought in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], [[World Fighting Alliance|WFA]], [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]] and [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]].

Miller's father was an [[82nd Airborne]] [[paratrooper]] in the [[United States Army]]. After Miller was expelled from high school for fighting, he and his family had to move 40 miles so that he could go to school in a new district. Miller knew he wanted to compete professionally. He earned his yellow belt in [[Taekwondo]] at age 11 and joined his new High school's [[wrestling]] team and would challenge the instructors of [[karate]] schools to spar. He was guided by a [[judo]] instructor to attend one of the first [[mixed martial arts]] schools. Miller had his first fight in [[Virginia Beach]] when he was 17 years old, against 27-year-old Al \"Superman\" Dill. Miller won the fight and officially began his MMA career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/10/20/my-first-fight-mayhem-miller|title=My First Fight: 'Mayhem' Miller|author=Ben Fowlkes|date=20 October 2011|work=MMA Fighting|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nAfter his submission win over [[Ronald Jhun]], earning Miller his first Superbrawl Championship, a riot broke out and Miller was punched in the back of the head by a fellow fighter, Mark Moreno.<ref name=\"lockflow.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060629101523/http://www.lockflow.com/article_view.php?id=184]</ref> This set the stage for a grudge match, and Miller dominated Moreno, finishing him with an [[armbar]] at the end of round one making the [[shaka sign]] before finishing him.\n\nOn September 2, 2006, Mayhem won the Icon Sport Middleweight title from [[Robbie Lawler]] in a back and forth battle. After being staggered and nearly finished by Lawler, Mayhem secured an [[arm triangle choke]] and won in the third round. In December of the same year, Mayhem lost his first title defense to [[Frank Trigg]] via [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the second round, a fight many thought he was the favorite to win.\n\nMayhem stepped into the [[Dream 4]] tournament on short notice and scored an impressive win in the semifinals, he was eliminated by [[Ronaldo Souza]] in the quarterfinals. Miller lost a [[unanimous decision]] to \"Jacare\" in a fast-paced grappling style bout that saw him escape submission after submission.\n\nAfter back and forth battles of words on Japanese, Brazilian and American media, Miller and Souza fought again, but this time for the Dream Middleweight belt. (the title was vacant as [[Gegard Mousasi]] moved to the Light Heavyweight division). The fight ended in a no-contest when Miller landed a [[soccer kick]] to Souza's forehead (formerly a legal strike, but had been outlawed), which opened a large gash and prompted a doctor stoppage. Both fighters agreed to face each other in an event in September 2009. The match was canceled after Souza signed with the [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Ronaldo-Jacare-Souza-signs-with-Strikeforce.html|title=Five Knuckles|accessdate=22 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807055616/http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Ronaldo-Jacare-Souza-signs-with-Strikeforce.html|archivedate=7 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nMiller fought Jake Shields on November 7, 2009 on [[CBS]] as a part of [[Strikeforce: Fedor vs Rogers]]. The fight was for the Strikeforce Middleweight Championship as [[Cung Le]] stepped down as champion. After a brief punching exchange that staggered Shields, the fight was mostly grappling, Miller lost via unanimous decision (48\u201347, 49\u201346, and 49\u201346). The closest the match came to ending was in the third round when Miller secured a [[rear naked choke]] on Shields, but time ended before Shields tapped out.\n\nMayhem fought Tim Stout at [[Strikeforce: Nashville]] on April 17, 2010 and won the fight by with a [[ground and pound]] TKO at 1:47 of the first round.\n\nMiller was expected to face Robbie Lawler on June 16, 2010 at [[Strikeforce: Los Angeles]], but was removed from the card after the Tennessee Athletic Commission suspended him for his part in the Nashville Brawl. After Shields' win over [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] veteran and former [[Pride FC]] Welterweight and Middlweight Champion [[Dan Henderson]], Mayhem confronted Jake Shields for a title rematch. Although Jake was not surprised, [[Nick Diaz]], [[Nate Diaz]], and the rest of Team [[Gracie family|Gracie]] fought with Miller in the cage, prompting [[CBS]] announcer [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] to say \"Gentlemen, we are on national television.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Lawler-Sobral-Set-for-June-16-Strikeforce-Expects-Mayhem-To-Be-Suspended-24151|title=Lawler-Sobral Set for June 16; Strikeforce Expects 'Mayhem' To Be Suspended|author=Loretta Hunt}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Mayhem aggressively called out [[Nick Diaz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o864hZ5lAuM |title=Joe Rogan & Mayhem Miller talk more Strikeforce, UFC, and Bully Beatdown! |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> the bout never materialized.

During that interview, Mayhem interrupted Shields and asked \"Where's my rematch, buddy?\" [[Gilbert Melendez]] and Shields responded by pushing Miller away, and [[Nick Diaz]] then threw a punch at Miller which started a brawl. Members of the Cesar Gracie Jiu-Jitsu camp, including Melendez, Nick and [[Nate Diaz]], attacked Miller while he was held down on the canvas by other members of the Gracie camp. The fight was eventually broken up by referees, members of Dan Henderson's corner and the promoter's security personnel.\nMiller and five other participants in the brawl were each given three-month suspensions, and fines ranging between $5,000 and $7,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Coker-on-King-Mo-Babalu-Stalemate-International-Shows-135-Womens-Tourney-Kharitonov-Signing-and-More-25162|title=Coker on King Mo-Babalu Stalemate, International Shows, 135 Women's Tourney, Kharitonov Signing and More|author=Loretta Hunt}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of the Nashville Brawl, Miller expressed an interest in fighting Nick Diaz.

Miller continued to attempt to set up a fight, offering 183&nbsp;lb as a catchweight. Diaz counter-offered a catchweight of 181&nbsp;lb.

He was taken down for the rest of the fight and lost via unanimous decision (29\u201328, 30\u201326, and 29\u201328). Mayhem had very publicly stated on his Twitter page that if he lost the fight, he would retire.\n\nOne day following the loss, [[Dana White]] ignored Miller's statement of retirement, instead opting to publicly fire Miller.

They are intended to increase strength, fitness and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing, bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's bodyweight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination.\n\nUrban calisthenics are a form of street workout; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in urban areas. Individuals and groups train to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as muscle-ups, levers, and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.\n\nSports teams and military units often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of synchronized physical training (often including a customized \"call and response\" routine) to increase group cohesion and discipline. Calisthenics are also popular as a component of physical education in primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.\n\nIn addition to general fitness, calisthenic exercises are often used as baseline physical evaluations for military organizations around the world. Two examples are the [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|U.S. Army Physical Fitness Test]] and the [[United States Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test|U.S.M.C. Physical Fitness Test]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roper's gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831.jpg|thumb|350px|Roper's Gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831. Climbing, balancing and gymnastics have been popular forms of calisthenic exercise throughout history and are still practiced in the modern day.]]\nThe word ''calisthenics'' comes from the ancient Greek words ''kallos'' (\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), which means \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure that derives from the perfection of the human body), and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|sthenos}}'' (\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"strength\" (great mental strength, courage, strength and determination).

Street workout consists of athletes performing calisthenics routines in timed sessions in front of a panel of judges. The World Street Workout & Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF) based in Riga, Latvia orchestrates the annual National Championships and hosts the World Championships for all the national champions to compete at one competition. The World Calisthenics Organization (WCO) based in Los Angeles, CA. promotes a series of  competitions known globally as the Battle of the Bars. The WCO created the first ever set of rules for formal competitions, including weight classes, timed round system, original judging criteria and a 10-point must system - giving increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these global competitions.\n\n==Common exercises==\n[[File:Kniebeuge.jpg|thumb|A squat exercise. After squatting down the exerciser stands up again while moving their hands back to their sides.]]\nThe more commonly performed calisthenic exercises include: \n\n=== Most common === \n* [[Push-up]]s\n:Performed face down on the floor, palms against floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position, while avoiding resting on the floor. Chest, shoulders, and triceps are trained with this exercise.\n* [[Sit-up]]s\n: A person lies on their back with their legs bent. They bend at the waist and move their head and torso towards their legs. They then lower themselves back down to the start position.\n* [[Squat (exercise)|Squats]]\n:Standing with feet shoulder width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this action they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides. Squats train the [[quadriceps]], [[hamstring]]s, calves, [[gluteal muscles]], and core. The height of the squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the individual i.e. if someone struggles with exercise they can do half squats. They are among the most versatile calisthenic exercises because they can be performed easily in most environments and with a limited amount of space.  \n\n=== Common ===\n*[[Burpee (exercise)|Burpees]]\n: A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, arms, legs, and some parts of the back.\n* [[Chin-up]]s and [[pull-ups (exercise)|pull-up]]s\n[[File:Marine Pull-ups.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a US Marine performing a pull-up.|A [[US Marine]] performs a [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]], a common calisthenic exercise.]]\n: ''Chin-ups'' and ''pull-ups'' are similar exercises but use opposite facing grips.\n: For a chin-up, the palms of the hands are facing the person as they pull up their body using the [[chin-up bar]]. The chin-up focuses on the [[biceps]] muscles, rather than the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] which is the focus of the pull-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/main/popup/name/chin-up|title=Chin-Up Exercise Guide and Video|website=Bodybuilding.com}}</ref>\n: For a pull-up, the bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|lats]] or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms.\n* [[Dip (exercise)|Dips]]\n:Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoids]], especially the anterior portion.\n* [[Front lever]] and [[back lever]]\n:A ''front lever'' is performed by performing a lat pulldown of the bar with straight arms until the body is parallel to the ground, with the front of the body facing upwards. May be done on rings or pull-up bar.\n:A ''back lever'' is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar, until the gymnast's body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor.\n* [[Handstand]]\n[[File:Maurice Ruiz and Ben Poon.jpg | thumb | 220px | The wall walk is an exercise for achieving handstands ]]\n:A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart.\n* [[Hyperextension (exercise)|Hyperextensions]]\n: Performed in a prone position on the ground, the individual raises the legs, arms and upper body off the ground.\n* [[Leg raise]]s\n:Lying on the back, hands in fists under buttocks, move feet up and down.\n* [[L-sit]] \n:The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable \"L\" shape, hence the name \"L-sit\". The L sit requires you to keep your core tensed and hold your legs horizontal so your body sits in a perfect 'L' position. This requires significant abdominal strength and a high level of hamstring flexibility.\n* [[Muscle-up]]s\n:One of the basic calisthenics routines. Performed by a combination routine of a pull-up followed by a dip. May be done on pullup bars or rings.\n*[[Planche (exercise)|Planche]]\n* [[Plank (exercise)|Planks]]\n[[File:Plank with medicine ball.JPG|thumb|Plank on medicine balls]]\n:This is the name for holding the 'top' position of a [[press-up|push-up]] for extended periods of time. The primary muscle involved in this exercise is the rectus abdominis.\n* [[Multi-stage fitness test|Shuttle runs]]\n:This is running back and forth between two points (or cones) typically separated by 5-40 meters, as fast as possible, with a touchdown. The emphasis should be on stopping, turning back and accelerate back to a sprint as quickly as possible.\n*Squat jumps\n:A variant of the [[Squat (exercise)|squat]]. Performed by entering a [[squatting position]], then using a [[Plyometrics|plyometric]] jumping movement to jump as high as possible.\n\n==Co-operative calisthenics==\nCo-operative calisthenics refers to calisthenic exercises which involve two or more participants helping each other to perform the exercise. Such exercises are also known as partner exercises, or bodyweight exercises with a partner. Usually one person performs the exercise and the other person adds resistance. For example, a person performing squats with someone on their back. Some exercises also involve the use of equipment. Two people may hold onto different ends of a rope and pull in different directions. One person would deliberately provide a lesser amount of resistance, which adds resistance to the exercise whilst also allowing the other person to move through a full range of motion as their superior level of force application pulls the rope along. A disadvantage such exercises have is that it can be hard to measure how much resistance is being added by the partner when considered in comparison to free weights or machines. The advantages they have is that they allow for relatively high levels of resistance to be added with equipment being optional. On this basis, co-operative calisthenics can be just as easily performed on a playing field as in a gym.<ref>Kraemer, W.J. & Fleck S.J., 'Partner exercises' in ''Strength Training for Young Athletes'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, pp.83-86</ref> They are also versatile enough to allow them to be used for training goals other than simply strength. For example a squat with a partner can be turned into a power focused exercise by jumping or hopping with the partner instead, or even lifting them up on one knee.\n\n==Calisthenics parks==\n[[File:Calisthenics in Osdorp.jpg|thumb|Park in [[Osdorp]], Amsterdam, NLD where one can practice calisthenics.]]\nAn increasing number of [[outdoor fitness]] training areas and [[Outdoor gym|outdoor gyms]] are being built around the world.

They are intended to increase strength, fitness and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing, bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's bodyweight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination.\n\nUrban calisthenics are a form of street workout; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in urban areas. Individuals and groups train to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as muscle-ups, levers, and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.\n\nSports teams and military units often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of synchronized physical training (often including a customized \"call and response\" routine) to increase group cohesion and discipline. Calisthenics are also popular as a component of physical education in primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.\n\nIn addition to general fitness, calisthenic exercises are often used as baseline physical evaluations for military organizations around the world. Two examples are the [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|U.S. Army Physical Fitness Test]] and the [[United States Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test|U.S.M.C. Physical Fitness Test]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roper's gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831.jpg|thumb|350px|Roper's Gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831. Climbing, balancing and gymnastics have been popular forms of calisthenic exercise throughout history and are still practiced in the modern day.]]\nThe word ''calisthenics'' comes from the ancient Greek words ''kallos'' (\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), which means \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure that derives from the perfection of the human body), and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|sthenos}}'' (\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"strength\" (great mental strength, courage, strength and determination).
