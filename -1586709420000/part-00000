With Shandong Medical University the former campus of Cheeloo University became part of Shandong University (as the  West Campus, renamed Baotuquan Campus in 2009). The campus of  Shandong University of Technology became the South Campus of Shandong University (renamed Qianfoshan Campus in 2009).

second-year undergraduate students, began in 2003.\n\nIn July 2019, the university attracted controversy when it was reported that male foreign students were assigned three female Chinese \"buddies\",

The architecture of the new campus is intended to blend Chinese and western elements. Many buildings will incorporate the red roofs and other building style elements of the German colonial architecture in Qingdao. The master plan for the campus was developed by Perkins Eastman (New York). One of the founders of Perkins Eastman, [[Bradford Perkins (architect)|Bradford Perkins]] is the grandson of Dwight H. Perkins, whose firm (Perkins, Fellows, & Hamilton) designed the Cheeloo University campus in Jinan. The campus will be dedicated to advanced science and engineering research, with a special emphasis on interfacing with high-tech industry and international academic collaboration. It is part of a plan to give Shandong University a presence that is distributed throughout the province<ref name=shenzhendaily2010/> in a manner that is comparable to the [[University of California|University of California system]], but retains a greater level of central control.<ref name=shenzhendaily2010/>\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Sdu baotuquan campus yang yunlei 3.jpg|thumb|Historical building on the Baotuquan Campus]]\n\nAt the top level, Shandong University is governed by a president ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u6821|\u957f}}|p={{linktext|Xi\u00e0o|zh\u01ceng}}}}) and a cabinet of vice presidents ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u526f|\u6821|\u957f}}|p={{linktext|F\u00f9| Xi\u00e0o|zh\u01ceng}}}}), each with a specific portfolio of responsibilities (e.g., research, international exchange).

Shandong also is associated in a sister school for American Middle Schools and Junior Highs, including Scofield Magnet Middle School. Among its faculty are international researchers and scholars, who either visit for a short term (less than 1 month, 160 visitors in 2009), a medium term (less than half a year, 70 visitors in 2009), or for the long term (more than half a year, 80 visitors in 2009). Of the 80 long-term international faculty members, 30 language scholars teach languages such as English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish, and Russian. The others are active in disciplines such as philosophy, biology, chemistry, physics, law, international politics and economics, as well as Chinese classics and traditional philosophy.\n\nAbout 1500 international students from about 40 countries come to study at Shandong University each year. An international student population numbering more than 1000 can be found on campus at any given time during the semester. Most of these international students come from Asian and African countries, but there are also students from Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Since 1980, Shandong University has received more than 10,000 students from over 60 countries. Popular study subjects are Chinese language and culture, but also economics and medicine. Furthermore, Shandong University participates in international short term exchange programs and receives approximately 2500 international student visitors for such programs per year.\n\nIn 2006, Shandong University created a joint urban research center with the [[University of Cincinnati]] in the United States, and a presence on each other's campus.<ref>[http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.asp?id=4007 Trip to Promote UC's China Strategy Pays Off in First Comprehensive Agreement With Chinese University]</ref> An International Laboratory operated in the a partnership with [[Virginia Tech]] was inaugurated in the Integrated Research Building  on the Central Campus in August 2010.

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]]. He was born and raised in the Maywood suburb of Chicago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|title=John Prine Endures, With a Half-Smile and a Song|date=April 6, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 30, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330175317/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zcAvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22William+Mason+Prine%22&source=bl&ots=jDOm_3v6oV&sig=ACfU3U35TPsyQSJTsNvdrVEMe6ixKUIQpQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjkg93TiNjoAhUMmuAKHXncA00Q6AEwA3oECAkQAQ|title=John Prine: In Spite of Himself|first=Eddie|last=Huffman|date=March 15, 2015|page=76|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|via=Google Books}}</ref> In summers, they would go back to visit family near [[Paradise, Kentucky]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/john-prine-discusses-his-life-and-his-formation-music-0 |title=John Prine discusses his life and his formation in music |date=1975 |work=Studs Terkel Radio Archive |access-date=2020-04-11 |publisher=WFMT and Chicago History Museum |language=en}}</ref> Prine started playing guitar at age 14, taught by his brother, David.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |title=John Prine Information |website=Shrout.co.uk |date=October 10, 1946 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006062927/http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/98957222421345075 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> and [[Proviso East High School|Proviso Township High School]] (later called Proviso East) in [[Maywood, Illinois]].

It was produced by Steve Cropper.
