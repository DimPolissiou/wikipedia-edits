Many of these ships had substantial spread of the disease, although many did not.  On the British-registered {{ship||Diamond Princess|ship|2}}, which had been quarantined at [[Port of Yokohama|Yokohama]] from 4 February 2020 for nearly a month, there was substantial spread of the virus amongst the passengers and crew, drawing headlines worldwide throughout February.  The ship had about 3,700 passengers and crew on board; around 700 people were infected in the incident, and twelve died. On 20 February, the [[World Health Organisation]] stated that the ship accounted for more than half of the reported infections around the world, outside of China.<ref name=\"theguardian1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/20/coronavirus-live-updates-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-japan-deaths-latest-news-china-infections |title=Cruise ship accounts for more than half of virus cases outside China \u2013 as it happened |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 February 2020 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304102207/https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/20/coronavirus-live-updates-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-japan-deaths-latest-news-china-infections |archive-date=4 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe crisis management team of the German federal government said on 4 March 2020, following several actual and suspected outbreaks on cruise ships, \"The Federal Foreign Office has included in its travel advice that there is an increased risk of quarantine on cruise ships.\"<ref name=berliner/> On 11 March 2020, [[Viking Cruises]] suspended operations for its 79-vessel fleet until the end of April, cancelling all ocean and river cruises, after it was revealed that a passenger on a cruise in Cambodia had been exposed to the virus while in transit via plane, placing at least 28 other passengers in quarantine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vikingrivercruises.com.au/my-trip/current-sailings/index.html|title=My Trip \u2013 Updates on Current Sailings|website=vikingrivercruises.com.au|access-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312181910/https://www.vikingrivercruises.com.au/my-trip/current-sailings/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/viking-cruises-coronavirus-suspends-operations-industry-struggles-2020-3 |title=Viking Cruises suspended operations worldwide due to the coronavirus, as infections ravage the cruise industry |first=Bill |last=Bostock |website=Business Insider |date=12 March 2020 |access-date=12 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312174617/https://www.businessinsider.com/viking-cruises-coronavirus-suspends-operations-industry-struggles-2020-3 |archive-date=12 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, on 12 March, [[Princess Cruises]], owner of virus-stricken ships ''Diamond Princess'' and {{ship||Grand Princess}}, suspended operations for all future cruises on its 18-ship fleet for 60 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/global-ship-operations-pause.html|title=Princess Cruises: Voluntary 60 Day Pause of Global Ship Operations \u2013 Notices & Advisories|publisher=Princess Cruises|date=12 March 2020|website=princess.com|access-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312190604/https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/global-ship-operations-pause.html|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/12/coronavirus-viking-cruises-suspends-cruise-operations-until-may-1/5030006002/ |title=Princess Cruises suspends operations for 60 days;
