The case dealt with an insurer's duty to defend an insured party in light of the insured's intentional acts of property damage. The insured, a drunken college student, spelled out \"FOO\" \u2013 meaning \"foo\", a word derived from Foofur \u2013 on the [[artificial turf]] [[American football field|football field]] of [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] with [[Charcoal lighter fluid|lighter fluid]] burning the letters into the turf. He caused $600,000 damage to the AstroTurf. The court held that such an act was not within the [[insurance policy]]'s liability coverage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nationwide Insurance v.

It featured the antics of a range of [[insect|bug-like]] characters who lived in the kitchen of an unnamed house. These creatures apparently only came out when the resident humans were \"not about.\" In the third and final series the characters moved out of the house and opened a somewhat seedy restaurant (\"Bug Bites\") where they set about serving Weasel Curry to their regular clientele. 78 episodes were made in total and were repeated regularly on GMTV, [[Tiny Living]]<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20000815224654/http://www.guardian.co.uk/TV/ukliving.html</ref> and [[Channel 4]] between 1996 and 2004. \n\nAfter the first two series the show format was bought by Channel 4, which commissioned 26 further episodes. These, and the previous series, were aired in their weekend morning slot. The show was characterised by its somewhat adult references and themes, most of which went above the heads of watching children.\n\nThe 78 30-minute scripts were co-written by the director [[Peter Eyre]] and the main puppeteer, [[Francis Wright (puppeteer)|Francis Wright]]. The executive producer was Catherine Robins of [[Two Sides TV]]. The first two seasons for GMTV are now owned by [[DHX Media]] who produce former programming for [[Wild Brain]]. Episodes formerly air in HD format on many of the [[Wild Brain]] official YouTube pages until it was taken down.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n*Grub Bug: The father figure and chef of the family. Pompous, red and fat, he had a rather military manner and a fondness for popping down to his shed to \"tend his vegetables\". He was sensitive about his incipient balding and once sought to hide it under a ginger wig.  Very fond of Mystic Mug, they holidayed together at Frinton-on-sea.\n*Mystic Mug Bug aka Mystic Mug: Originally loosely modelled on celebrity fortune teller \"[[Mystic Meg]]\", her metier was crystal ball reading, where (in the first two series) she would retail \"Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts\". Increasingly eccentric as the series progressed, she often teetered uncertainly on the edge of sanity.\n*Doodle Bug: An emotional Mr. Fix-it and artist who would design and build all manner of gadgets with which to wreak havoc over a twenty-minute time slot. Something of a sadist.\n*Plug Bug: Doodle Bug's best friend. He is a craven coward and a little flowery in nature, but stubbornly protective of his sink when it comes to what everyone puts down it. Good to his mother.\n*Buggins: Orange worm-like creature. Irritatingly enthusiastic and jolly. Regularly beaten into line by the previous two, he generally came up smiling...until the next time.\n*Grunge and Slopp: A pair of dirty, green, hairy hippie types who told jokes and sang songs. Very rarely referred to by name. They also occasionally got involved in the main action, often playing pranks on the other characters.\n*Gorgon and Zola: A husband and wife team of fuzzy worms. Aggressive to all and sundry, they were also resident jokesters. Background dancers for most of the songs.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*The Customer: Arrived in series 3. Real name; Roy, he lived in a mobile home on the side of the A3. Spent a lot of time in the caf\u00e9 but rarely actually seemed to eat anything.\n*The Health Inspector: Came and went in the course of one episode. Got stuck to Grub Bug and, after various threats, posted a glowing report on the caf\u00e9.\n*The Genie: Came, offered wishes, left.\n*Baxter: Plug Bug's dear chum, a practical joker. Came unstuck when he played one joke too many on Mystic Mug. Last seen disappearing down a large hole.\n*Bernard: A robot built by Doodle Bug with a nice/nasty switch on his back. Brought havoc over two episodes.\n*Henri: A French chef to whom Mystic Mug took rather a shine. Tied up Grub Bug and then came to a violent end.\n*Doodle Bug's Granny: Appeared in Series 2, transpired it was Doodle Bug dressed up all along.\n*Squelch: Buggins' brother. So called because that was the noise people tended to make when he sat on them.\n\n== Regular strands ==\n*Raid the Fridge: A short interstitial sequence where Grub Bug would show how to make some unspeakable [[culinary art]]. \n*In the Bin: Ditto, but involving Doodle Bug doing some [[arts and crafts]] and making something out of the items he finds in his bin.\n*Through the Washing Machine/Notice Board: Short sequence where some child demonstrated something of little interest.\n*Through the Cat Flap: Short sequence narrated by [[Rebecca Nagan]] shot from a Scottish cat's point of view as she tramped about observing humans she also went to locations across the UK\n*Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts: Series 1 and 2 only. Mystic Mug presents items of trivia related to the day's topics.\n\n==Media Releases==\n* Letters, Colours and Animals VHS (1997)\n* Numbers and other stories VHS (2001)\n* Numbers and Liquid DVD

It featured the antics of a range of [[insect|bug-like]] characters who lived in the kitchen of an unnamed house. These creatures apparently only came out when the resident humans were \"not about.\" In the third and final series the characters moved out of the house and opened a somewhat seedy restaurant (\"Bug Bites\") where they set about serving Weasel Curry to their regular clientele. 78 episodes were made in total and were repeated regularly on GMTV, [[Tiny Living]]<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20000815224654/http://www.guardian.co.uk/TV/ukliving.html</ref> and [[Channel 4]] between 1996 and 2004. \n\nAfter the first two series the show format was bought by Channel 4, which commissioned 26 further episodes. These, and the previous series, were aired in their weekend morning slot. The show was characterised by its somewhat adult references and themes, most of which went above the heads of watching children.\n\nThe 78 30-minute scripts were co-written by the director [[Peter Eyre]] and the main puppeteer, [[Francis Wright (puppeteer)|Francis Wright]]. The executive producer was Catherine Robins of [[Two Sides TV]]. The first two seasons for GMTV are now owned by [[DHX Media]] who produce former programming for [[Wild Brain]]. Episodes formerly air in HD format on many of the [[Wild Brain]] official YouTube pages until it was taken down.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n*Grub Bug: The father figure and chef of the family. Pompous, red and fat, he had a rather military manner and a fondness for popping down to his shed to \"tend his vegetables\". He was sensitive about his incipient balding and once sought to hide it under a ginger wig.  Very fond of Mystic Mug, they holidayed together at Frinton-on-sea.\n*Mystic Mug Bug aka Mystic Mug: Originally loosely modelled on celebrity fortune teller \"[[Mystic Meg]]\", her metier was crystal ball reading, where (in the first two series) she would retail \"Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts\". Increasingly eccentric as the series progressed, she often teetered uncertainly on the edge of sanity.\n*Doodle Bug: An emotional Mr. Fix-it and artist who would design and build all manner of gadgets with which to wreak havoc over a twenty-minute time slot. Something of a sadist.\n*Plug Bug: Doodle Bug's best friend. He is a craven coward and a little flowery in nature, but stubbornly protective of his sink when it comes to what everyone puts down it. Good to his mother.\n*Buggins: Orange worm-like creature. Irritatingly enthusiastic and jolly. Regularly beaten into line by the previous two, he generally came up smiling...until the next time.\n*Grunge and Slopp: A pair of dirty, green, hairy hippie types who told jokes and sang songs. Very rarely referred to by name. They also occasionally got involved in the main action, often playing pranks on the other characters.\n*Gorgon and Zola: A husband and wife team of fuzzy worms. Aggressive to all and sundry, they were also resident jokesters. Background dancers for most of the songs.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*The Customer: Arrived in series 3. Real name; Roy, he lived in a mobile home on the side of the A3. Spent a lot of time in the caf\u00e9 but rarely actually seemed to eat anything.\n*The Health Inspector: Came and went in the course of one episode. Got stuck to Grub Bug and, after various threats, posted a glowing report on the caf\u00e9.\n*The Genie: Came, offered wishes, left.\n*Baxter: Plug Bug's dear chum, a practical joker. Came unstuck when he played one joke too many on Mystic Mug. Last seen disappearing down a large hole.\n*Bernard: A robot built by Doodle Bug with a nice/nasty switch on his back. Brought havoc over two episodes.\n*Henri: A French chef to whom Mystic Mug took rather a shine. Tied up Grub Bug and then came to a violent end.\n*Doodle Bug's Granny: Appeared in Series 2, transpired it was Doodle Bug dressed up all along.\n*Squelch: Buggins' brother. So called because that was the noise people tended to make when he sat on them.\n\n== Regular strands ==\n*Raid the Fridge: A short interstitial sequence where Grub Bug would show how to make some unspeakable [[culinary art]]. \n*In the Bin: Ditto, but involving Doodle Bug doing some [[arts and crafts]] and making something out of the items he finds in his bin.\n*Through the Washing Machine/Notice Board: Short sequence where some child demonstrated something of little interest.\n*Through the Cat Flap: Short sequence narrated by [[Rebecca Nagan]] shot from a Scottish cat's point of view as she tramped about observing humans she also went to locations across the UK\n*Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts: Series 1 and 2 only. Mystic Mug presents items of trivia related to the day's topics.\n\n==Media Releases==\n* Letters, Colours and Animals VHS (1997)\n* Numbers and other stories VHS (2001)\n* Numbers and Liquid DVD

Alison James.  The book is best known for its message about selfishness and sharing and for the distinctive shiny foil [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s of the Rainbow Fish. [[DHX Media|Decode Entertainment]] turned the story into an [[animated television series]] of the same name, which had aired on the [[HBO#List of channels|HBO Family]] [[television channel]] in the United States and [[Teletoon]] in Canada from 1999 until 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is about a fish with shiny, multi-coloured scales named Rainbow Fish. He has blue, green, and purple scales. Interspersed with these colourful scales are shiny, holographic scales which are his favourites. One day a small blue fish asks him if he could have one of his shiny silver scales. Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The small blue fish tells all the other fish that Rainbow Fish was being rude, and as a result the others do not want to play with him anymore.\n\nHis only remaining friend, the starfish tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. When he goes to the cave, he sees the octopus, who says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she gives Rainbow Fish her advice: He must share his scales with the other fish. He might not be the most beautiful fish after that, but he will discover how to be happy. Rainbow Fish says he can't share his scales, and the octopus disappears in a cloud of ink. \n\nWhen he encounters the little blue fish for a second time, Rainbow Fish gives away one of his precious scales and sees the little fish's joy. With that one shiny scale gone, he immediately feels much better. Very soon the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by other fish requesting scales and he shares one of his shiny scales with the each of them. Soon everyone has one shiny scale, including Rainbow Fish. Rainbow Fish is finally happy.  \n\n==Theme==\nA ''Publishers Weekly'' reviewer called the book a \"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Children's Book Review: The Rainbow Fish |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55858-009-1|publisher=Publishers Weekly}}</ref>\n\n==Book series==\n\nThere are five other sequels in the book series:\n\n* ''Rainbow Fish to the Rescue'': About the acceptance and integration of foreigners.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale'': About arguments and how to settle them.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Sea Monster's Cave'': About irrational and rational fears.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Finds his Way'': With the help of his new friends, Rainbow Fish finds his way back home.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea'': About modesty and happiness.\n\n==Short film==\nOn March 25 1997, an animated adaptation of the book was released on VHS and DVD. The home video releases also contain the film ''Dazzle the Dinosaur'' which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \"Giving Makes You Special\".\n\n==Television series==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Rainbow Fish\n| image                = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = \n| creator              = [[Marcus Pfister]]\n| based_on             = \n| writer               = {{Plainlist|\n* Dean Stefan\n* [[Rowby Goren]]\n* Richard Stanley\n* Alan Swayze\n* [[Ian James Corlett]]\n* Brooks Wachtel\n* Shelley Zellman\n* Patti Carr\n* Lara Runnels\n* Francis Moss\n* S.

Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \"The School of Fish\". There is a [[shipwreck]] called \"Shipwreck Park\" in the series that resembles the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic]]. It was produced by [[Decode Entertainment]] and [[EM.TV]] for [[Sony Wonder]].\n\n===Characters===\n<!-- This is an American television program and therefore should be in American English, not British English. -->\n{{fanpov|section|date=July 2014}}\n\n'''Rainbow Fish''': The proud, vibrant fish that lives with his parents and sister.

Alison James.  The book is best known for its message about selfishness and sharing and for the distinctive shiny foil [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s of the Rainbow Fish. [[DHX Media|Decode Entertainment]] turned the story into an [[animated television series]] of the same name, which had aired on the [[HBO#List of channels|HBO Family]] [[television channel]] in the United States and [[Teletoon]] in Canada from 1999 until 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is about a fish with shiny, multi-coloured scales named Rainbow Fish. He has blue, green, and purple scales. Interspersed with these colourful scales are shiny, holographic scales which are his favourites. One day a small blue fish asks him if he could have one of his shiny silver scales. Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The small blue fish tells all the other fish that Rainbow Fish was being rude, and as a result the others do not want to play with him anymore.\n\nHis only remaining friend, the starfish tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. When he goes to the cave, he sees the octopus, who says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she gives Rainbow Fish her advice: He must share his scales with the other fish. He might not be the most beautiful fish after that, but he will discover how to be happy. Rainbow Fish says he can't share his scales, and the octopus disappears in a cloud of ink. \n\nWhen he encounters the little blue fish for a second time, Rainbow Fish gives away one of his precious scales and sees the little fish's joy. With that one shiny scale gone, he immediately feels much better. Very soon the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by other fish requesting scales and he shares one of his shiny scales with the each of them. Soon everyone has one shiny scale, including Rainbow Fish. Rainbow Fish is finally happy.  \n\n==Theme==\nA ''Publishers Weekly'' reviewer called the book a \"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Children's Book Review: The Rainbow Fish |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55858-009-1|publisher=Publishers Weekly}}</ref>\n\n==Book series==\n\nThere are five other sequels in the book series:\n\n* ''Rainbow Fish to the Rescue'': About the acceptance and integration of foreigners.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale'': About arguments and how to settle them.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Sea Monster's Cave'': About irrational and rational fears.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Finds his Way'': With the help of his new friends, Rainbow Fish finds his way back home.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea'': About modesty and happiness.\n\n==Short film==\nOn March 25 1997, an animated adaptation of the book was released on VHS and DVD. The home video releases also contain the film ''Dazzle the Dinosaur'' which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \"Giving Makes You Special\".\n\n==Television series==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Rainbow Fish\n| image                = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = \n| creator              = [[Marcus Pfister]]\n| based_on             = \n| writer               = {{Plainlist|\n* Dean Stefan\n* [[Rowby Goren]]\n* Richard Stanley\n* Alan Swayze\n* [[Ian James Corlett]]\n* Brooks Wachtel\n* Shelley Zellman\n* Patti Carr\n* Lara Runnels\n* Francis Moss\n* S.

Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \"The School of Fish\". There is a [[shipwreck]] called \"Shipwreck Park\" in the series that resembles the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic]]. It was produced by [[Decode Entertainment]] and [[EM.TV]] for [[Sony Wonder]].\n\n===Characters===\n<!-- This is an American television program and therefore should be in American English, not British English. -->\n{{fanpov|section|date=July 2014}}\n\n'''Rainbow Fish''': The proud, vibrant fish that lives with his parents and sister.

There are sixteen ten minute episodes, and the characters were created and the stories written by writer Richard Everett. The series was aired by [[Channel 4]] in 1994. It aired on children's channels like [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIt was about two bumbling [[construction worker]]s (Dig and Dug), who were given a task to accomplish over a five minute short. Aside from using segments much like [[Laurel and Hardy]] shorts, the show also taught children about [[construction]]. The show was narrated by [[George Layton]]. The animated series was created, produced and directed by Terry Ward M D at Flicks Films Ltd, Wardour Street, London.\n\n== Major characters ==\n* '''Dig''': Dig is Dug's fellow companion, young, tall and skinny in appearance. Despite being eager, hard working, and ready for the job, he is quite na\u00efve, can be easily frightened, and is inexperienced. This can often lead to comical predicaments! However, little by little, Dig is starting to learn a little bit more about machinery and construction. He is presumably in his early 30s.\n* '''Dug''': Dug is Dig's fellow co worker. He is stumpy, a little bit older than Dig, a bit more experienced with machinery, but just as bumbling and na\u00efve. Dug often controls (or tries to control) the assignments given to him and Dig, but his clumsiness often gets the two of them into trouble. He can even make little, fixable problems become huge and serious. He is most likely just about in his 40s.\n* '''Daisy''': Daisy is Dug's long suffering niece. She is smarter than the two construction workers put together, so this allows her and her Aunt Beth to solve almost any problem that Dig and Dug cannot solve at all. Neither her mother nor father have ever appeared on the show for unknown reasons, but it is safe to assume that her Uncle Dug would be the brother of either one of Daisy's parents.\n* '''Farmer Stubble''': Farmer Stubble lives at Merryweather Farm. He appeared as a main character in the first four episodes, 'The New Tractor', 'Turnips in the Lane', 'Fencing the Field' and 'Trouble at the Haybarn.' His first name is revealed to be Ernest and his wife's name is Mildred. Mrs. Stubble also appeared in 'The New Tractor' and 'Trouble at the Haybarn', but in 'Turnips in the Lane' and 'Fencing the Field', Farmer Stubble appeared without her. As his name suggests, he has a [[Shaving|stubble]] on his chin.\nHowever, the two of them appeared in 'Night Patrol' and Ernest also appeared in 'The New Office'. They even appeared in flashbacks from the first two episodes seen in 'The 100th Tractor' when Dug was telling the Mayoress about several adventures that he and Dig had been on earlier while taking her to the tractor factory.\n* '''Mr. Rubble''': Dig and Dug's building site boss. It is unknown what accent he talks in, although his voice does have a loud booming tone. The only four episodes he appeared in were 'Mrs. Sparkle's Shed', 'Cement Pudding', 'Mr. Rubble's Wall' and 'Daisy's Kite'. Not to be confused with Barney Rubble from ''[[The Flintstones]]''.\n* '''Mr. MacAdam''': Mr. MacAdam is Dig and Dug's boss of the Roadworks site. He is very good with machinery and construction, but a closer look reveals that Mr. MacAdam is almost just as clumsy and bumbling as Dig and Dug himself. He talks in a [[Scots language|Scottish]] accent. The only four episodes he appeared in were 'Night Patrol', 'Nowhere to Park', 'The Giant Molehill' and 'Race to the Finish'.\n* '''Mr. Packet''': Mr. Packet is Dig and Dug's manager of the tractor factory and talks in a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] accent. he can discover voices inside the factory. he can deal with things such as Oswald behaving badly, his new office arriving late making him feel upset and worried, and solve Oswald's problem by 'saying he has run out of paint' on the day of 'The 100th Tractor'. The only four episodes he appeared in were 'All Hooked Up', 'Oswald Misbehaves', 'The New Office' and 'The 100th Tractor'.\n\n==International broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom\n**[[Channel 4]]\n**[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] (''[[Milkshake!]]'')\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n**[[Nickelodeon (Australia and New Zealand)|Nickelodeon]]\n* {{flagicon|Namibia}} Namibla\n**[[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Republic of Ireland\n**[[Network 2]] (''[[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]]'')\n* {{flagicon|SA}} South Africa\n**[[SABC2]] (''Tube'')\n* {{flagicon|Zimbabwe}} Zimbabwe\n**[[SABC2]] (''Tube'')\n* {{flagicon|Arab League}} Arab World\n** [[Spacetoon]]\n\n==References==\n* http://www.richardeverett.co.uk \u2013 The official website of writer Richard Everett\n[[Category:1994 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1994 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:Channel 4 television programmes]]\n[[Category:1990s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fictional trios]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Dig & Dug with Daisy\n| image                = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = Animation\n| creator              = Terry Ward\n| writer               = Richard Everett\n| director             = Terry Ward\n| creative_director    = \n| voices               = [[George Layton]]\n| narrated             = [[George Layton]]| opentheme            = \n| endtheme             = \n| composer             = [[Mark London]]<br>Francis Haines\n| country              = United Kingdom\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 1\n| num_episodes         = 16\n| list_episodes        = \n| executive_producer   = Simon Jollands\n| producer             = Terry Ward\n| editor               = \n| camera               = \n| runtime              = 10 minutes\n| company              = [[Dorling Kindersley]]\n| distributor          = \n| network              = [[Channel 4]]\n| picture_format       = 4:3\n| audio_format         = [[Monaural]]\n| first_aired          = \n| last_aired           = \n| website              = \n| production_website   = \n}}\n'''''Dig & Dug with Daisy''''' is a [[stop motion]] [[animated television series]] that was produced in the United Kingdom during 1993 by [[Dorling Kindersley]] (publishers of the ''Eyewitness Books'' Series).

It had two series of 13 episodes each and each episode runs for 22\u201325 minutes.\n\nThe series was loosely based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s original story \"[[Treasure Island]]\". Featuring a mysterious and dark storyline, it incorporates magic and many new characters. [[Billy Bones]] is not in this series, instead Jim's father Mr. Hawkins is in his place. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom and in other countries throughout Europe and [[Asia]] and was also aired in Australia on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV Network]]. The programme was a [[FilmFair]] production for [[Central Independent Television]], ''The Legends of Treasure Island'', is owned by [[ITV plc]].\n\n==Characters==\nThis cartoon, unlike most other Treasure Island cartoons and movies, featured the main characters as anthropomorphic [[animals]]:\n\n*'''[[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]]:''' ''[[Dog]]'': The main protagonist, he is cunning for his age, and determined to reach the treasure as his father asked him.\n*'''[[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]]:''' ''Dog'': A hermit found living on the Island, he knows more about the dangers of the Island and is able to provide warnings. He frequently describes things as being \"like a leech\" and often speaks in very vague terms that can be hard to understand.\n*'''[[Long John Silver]]:''' ''[[Fox]]'': Unlike the book and most adaptations, Long John Silver is not an anti-hero with dubious morality but rather a straight villain, although he does save Jim's life in episode 3.\n*'''[[Dr. Livesey (character)|Dr. Livesey]]:''' ''Dog'': Is a friend of Jim and his father, and aids the boy against the pirates.\n*'''[[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Smollett]]:''' ''Dog'': A brave captain who offers Jim his aid. When Jim states he cannot pay Smollett, he states that he will accept a new pair of boots after they find the treasure as payment. He is also the one who decides to go to Squire Trelawney for funding, as the two are close friends.\n*'''[[Squire Trelawney]]:''' ''[[Pigeon]]'': Squire Trelawney is a friendly, yet money obsessed character, who is only convinced to fund the expedition upon hearing the promise of treasure. He often acts as if he doesn't have a clue what he's doing, despite supposedly having gone on many adventures.\n*'''[[Blind Pew]]:''' ''[[Rat|Giant Rat]]'': The mysterious blind boss of Long John Silver.\n*'''Jane:''' ''[[Vixen]]'': One of the exclusive characters for this Treasure Island incarnation. Jane was kidnapped by Silver to be held for ransom, but since her parents did not want her he got stuck with her. In the first episode she switches sides and teams up with Jim, for whom she showed growing feelings as the series progressed.\n\nSubsidiary recurring characters included the pirates '''Morgan''' (a [[Hog (swine)|hog]]), '''Nebbich''' (a [[hyena]]), and '''Rat''' (who was, ostensibly enough, a [[rat]]). These characters featured mainly in the first season and only made minor appearances at the beginning of the second before disappearing altogether. Other minor pirates except [[Israel Hands]] seen during series 1 included a [[weasel]] and a [[rabbit]] among others.\n\n==Voice talents==\n\n=== Series 1 ===\n*[[Dawn French]] (Jim Hawkins)\n*[[Juliet Stevenson]] (Jane)\n*[[Richard E.

The entire 26 episodes however were released on video in Australia by [[Reel Entertainment]], with 13 volumes released.\n*A TV movie version featuring select episodes from series 1 of the show was released on Video & [[DVD]] in the US by [[Image Entertainment]].

It had two series of 13 episodes each and each episode runs for 22\u201325 minutes.\n\nThe series was loosely based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s original story \"[[Treasure Island]]\". Featuring a mysterious and dark storyline, it incorporates magic and many new characters. [[Billy Bones]] is not in this series, instead Jim's father Mr. Hawkins is in his place. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom and in other countries throughout Europe and [[Asia]] and was also aired in Australia on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV Network]]. The programme was a [[FilmFair]] production for [[Central Independent Television]], ''The Legends of Treasure Island'', is owned by [[ITV plc]].\n\n==Characters==\nThis cartoon, unlike most other Treasure Island cartoons and movies, featured the main characters as anthropomorphic [[animals]]:\n\n*'''[[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]]:''' ''[[Dog]]'': The main protagonist, he is cunning for his age, and determined to reach the treasure as his father asked him.\n*'''[[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]]:''' ''Dog'': A hermit found living on the Island, he knows more about the dangers of the Island and is able to provide warnings. He frequently describes things as being \"like a leech\" and often speaks in very vague terms that can be hard to understand.\n*'''[[Long John Silver]]:''' ''[[Fox]]'': Unlike the book and most adaptations, Long John Silver is not an anti-hero with dubious morality but rather a straight villain, although he does save Jim's life in episode 3.\n*'''[[Dr. Livesey (character)|Dr. Livesey]]:''' ''Dog'': Is a friend of Jim and his father, and aids the boy against the pirates.\n*'''[[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Smollett]]:''' ''Dog'': A brave captain who offers Jim his aid. When Jim states he cannot pay Smollett, he states that he will accept a new pair of boots after they find the treasure as payment. He is also the one who decides to go to Squire Trelawney for funding, as the two are close friends.\n*'''[[Squire Trelawney]]:''' ''[[Pigeon]]'': Squire Trelawney is a friendly, yet money obsessed character, who is only convinced to fund the expedition upon hearing the promise of treasure. He often acts as if he doesn't have a clue what he's doing, despite supposedly having gone on many adventures.\n*'''[[Blind Pew]]:''' ''[[Rat|Giant Rat]]'': The mysterious blind boss of Long John Silver.\n*'''Jane:''' ''[[Vixen]]'': One of the exclusive characters for this Treasure Island incarnation. Jane was kidnapped by Silver to be held for ransom, but since her parents did not want her he got stuck with her. In the first episode she switches sides and teams up with Jim, for whom she showed growing feelings as the series progressed.\n\nSubsidiary recurring characters included the pirates '''Morgan''' (a [[Hog (swine)|hog]]), '''Nebbich''' (a [[hyena]]), and '''Rat''' (who was, ostensibly enough, a [[rat]]). These characters featured mainly in the first season and only made minor appearances at the beginning of the second before disappearing altogether. Other minor pirates except [[Israel Hands]] seen during series 1 included a [[weasel]] and a [[rabbit]] among others.\n\n==Voice talents==\n\n=== Series 1 ===\n*[[Dawn French]] (Jim Hawkins)\n*[[Juliet Stevenson]] (Jane)\n*[[Richard E.

It was aired and released on home [[VHS|video]] in Australia as the 2nd episode of series 2, while chronologically it is the 4th episode.\n*When The Legends of Treasure Island got its solo video release in the UK from [[Pickwick Video]], it had 3 episodes; it omits the 2nd episode '''Memories Are Made Of This''', but it does contain the 1st, 3rd and 4th episode from series 1.\n*Although it was a UK show, the entire series was not made available on video there. The entire 26 episodes however were released on video in Australia by [[Reel Entertainment]], with 13 volumes released.\n*A TV movie version featuring select episodes from series 1 of the show was released on Video & [[DVD]] in the US by [[Image Entertainment]]. Both releases are now out of print.\n\n==Credits==\n\n===Series 1===\n'''1,3-5,7-13'''\n*Based on the Novel by: Robert Louis Stevenson\n*Music Composed and Conducted by: Barrington Pheloung\n*Directed by: Dino Athanassiou\n*Series Devised by: Peter Lewis, Barbara Slade\n*Character Designers: Dino Athanassiou, Paul Stibal, John Martin, Simon Ward-Horner, Bruce McNally, Alan Kerswell\n*Background Designer: Richard Zaloudek\n*Story Editor: Barbara Slade\n*Scripts Written by: Barbara Slade, Marty Isenberg, Robert N.

The presenters also traveled in the vehicles, addressing the camera as the action unfolded in front of them. They use names and develop personalities for particular cats to draw the audience into a relationship with them. The similarity to [[soap opera]]s led to ''Big Cat Diary'' being called \"the original wildlife soap opera\".<ref name=\"WAus article\"/>\n\nOriginally intended to be a one-off series, ''Big Cat Diary'' proved so popular a further eight series plus occasional specials were broadcast. It spawned a number of other programs using the same wildlife diary format, including ''Elephant Diaries'' (2005\u20132008), ''Chimp Week'' (2006), ''Big Bear Week'' (2006), and ''Orangutan Diary'' (2007\u20132009). For the first few series, the episodes were broadcast weekly, but after 2004, they were shown on consecutive nights over the course of a single week. The 2004, 2005, and 2006 series were called ''Big Cat Week''. Since 2005, the ''Big Cat Diary'' website has carried additional video footage from the field and in 2006 a spin-off series called ''Big Cat Uncut'' was broadcast on [[BBC Three]] immediately after the [[BBC One]] episodes.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, the series returned to British television screens as ''Big Cat Live'', the BBC Natural History Unit's most ambitious live international broadcast. Host Kate Silverton and local [[Maasai people|Maasai]] guide Jackson Looseyia joined regular presenters King and Scott for two weeks of nightly live programmes on BBC One. Additional broadcast content included ''Little Big Cat'' on [[CBeebies]] and ''Big Cat Raw'', a webcast hosted on [[BBC Online]]. An update programme with highlights was shown at Christmas 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/07_july/17/big_cat.shtml | title=Surprises, excitement and emotion await as Big Cat Live comes to BBC One, CBeebies, and bbc.co.uk.

The pride had a succession of male leaders: Scar and Scruffy (1998-2000), Simba and Blondie (2000-2004), Notch and Light Male (2004-2007), Clawed and Romeo (2007-2011). Three Graces are the daughters of Lion Notch and were born in 2005. The last filmed male leaders were known as the Four Musketeers: Scarface, Sikio, Morani, and Hunter.\n\nLionesses included White-Eye and the blonde sisters, Bibi and Lispy. There are also the Three Graces Joy, Charm and Beauty, three young females who had broken away from the main pride and formed a satellite group. In 2003, Bibi was kicked out of the pride and was featured on the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' as she struggled to raise her two cubs without the support of the pride. She was later accepted back into the main Marsh Pride.\n\n====The Ridge Pride====\nThis pride has only appeared in the more recent series. The main lions in this pride were Cheza and Sala, two young cubs growing up together despite having different parents. They were one of the main features of the 2004 series. As adults, they have since joined forces with another young lion from the Ridge Pride and taken over a nearby pride. Another former member of this pride was Solo, the only survivor of a litter of 3 or 4 cubs. He left his pride well before Cheza and Sala arrived. He teamed up with one of his older cousins to take over a pride. Solo was born in 2000 and was featured in the 3rd series of ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2000 and later in 4th series in 2002.\n\n====Tamu====\nThe focus of the 2006 series, Tamu was a lone lioness with four cubs fathered by Notch of the Marsh Pride. In Swahili, her name means \"the beautiful one.\" Tamu was a social outcast and had to hunt and raise her cubs alone. When a solitary rogue male invaded her den, she escaped with only two cubs, one of whom was injured and later died. Tamu found her remaining cubs after two days of searching. The audience watched as Tamu and the cubs investigated, licked, and acknowledged the death of their sibling. After a day, Tamu moved her young into the heart of Marsh territory to a den area most frequented by the rest of the pride. This put her in danger of the Marsh Pride lionesses who tried to oust Tamu and her cubs.\n\n====The Big Pride====\n\nBig Pride is also known as Acacia Pride or Gorge Pride. Filmed in 1996 as the first series of the show, they had a large number of lions\u201428--but were not filmed in following series.\n\n=== Cheetahs in the hostile world===\n\n====Kidogo====\nIn the first series in 1996, the show followed first-time mother Kidogo and her two 12-week-old cubs. While most cheetahs hunt during the day, Kidogo hunted late in the day. In one of ''Big Cat Diary'''s few episodes filmed at night, Kidogo and cubs come dangerously close to hunting lions.\n\n====Fundi ====\nFundi was also part of the first series. Fundi hunted regularly in thick [[acacia]] trees to keep her two adolescent cubs well-fed, unusual for cheetahs who usually hunt on open plains. Fundi means \"craftsman\" in Swahili.\n\n====Amber (sometimes known as Queen)====\nAmber was first seen in the second series in September 1998 as mother to three cubs of 16 months old. She used cars as vantage points to spot danger or prey. She was last seen and filmed in later October 2000 during the third series of the show.\n\n====Kimbia====\nKimbia was the territorial male cheetah of Amber's home range, filmed in the third ''Big Cat Diary'' in September\u2013October 2000.\n\n====Kike====\nAmber's daughter Kike (pronounced \"Kee-Kay\") returned in the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' in September 2003. Discovered at Rhino Ridge, Kike was mother to three cubs of nearly 9 months old. This was Kike's fourth litter, but she had not previously raised a cub to adulthood. Like her mother Amber, Kike used jeeps as vantage points to watch for danger or prey. The three cubs went on to appear in the 2004's ''Big Cat Week''. In an October 2008 webcast of ''Big Cat Raw'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] suggested Kike had not been spotted recently and had probably died. He confirmed her three cubs had survived and that her daughter Itchy had raised cubs of her own. Itchy was filmed in the first series of [[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]], and it is believed that another daughter of hers, named Serena, is mother of Malaika, the cheetah.\n\n====Honey and Toto====\nHoney was first featured on ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2002 as a capable first time mother of three tiny 8 week old cubs. For 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', viewers were introduced to her young cub, Toto, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning \"the little one\". Honey was not mentioned on screen as Toto's mother because this was not known until after the series was filmed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/bcd/slideshows/cheetahs/honey.shtml BBC - Science & Nature - Big Cat Diary - Honey]</ref> When he was first filmed, it was estimated that Toto was only 6\u20138 weeks old, making him the youngest cheetah cub ever to be filmed on ''Big Cat Diary''. In the final episode of the series, Toto went missing overnight after a storm and was not found. It was reported a few days later that Honey was found living alone. The end credits that year consisted entirely of footage of Toto.\n\nHoney returned in the 2006 in the fourth series. When filming began, she had four cubs but one was soon lost in a lion attack. In February 2007, nearly a year before she last appeared on screen, Honey was killed after a vet accidentally shot her in the wrong place with a tranquilizer dart. The dart did not go into the muscle but hit her in the stomach near her kidneys.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-511955/Honey-star-Big-Cat-Diary-killed-vets-blunder.html ''The Daily Mail'': Honey, star of Big Cat Diary, killed by vet's blunder]</ref> Her three remaining cubs, Snap (M-1), Crackle (M-2) and Pop (M-3), were cared for by the [[Mara Conservancy]].<ref>[http://paul-kirui.blogspot.com/2009/03/cheetahs-kill-zebra.html Paul Kirui Blog]</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Honey's three now fully grown sons were filmed during ''Big Cat Live''. Crackle (M-2) was killed by lions in 2011 and just two years later in 2013, Pop (M-3) also became the victim of lions. Snap (M-1) was named as \"Mjuzi\" which means \"the last survivor\" in Swahili. He was last spotted in April 2013.\n\n====Shakira and Duma====\nIn 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] (while following the story of Honey and Toto) introduced viewers to Duma and her mother (later named Shakira). She was also featured in ''Big Cat Diary: Family Histories.'' In ''Big Cat Live'' in 2008, Shakira was filmed with five 2-month-old cubs. They were attacked by some of the lions of Marsh pride and two eventually died during the series (possibly killed by [[hyena]]s).\n\n=== The leopards of Mara ===\n\n====Leopard Gorge====\n''Big Cat Diary'' only followed one leopard family through each generation. This family started with Half-Tail, a 9-year-old female in 1996, one of the most famous big cats who appeared on the show for quite a few years. She was named Half-Tail after a clash with baboons or lions in which she lost half her tail. This incident happened in 1993 when she was about 6 years old. She is the only leopard in the show who was not shown killing any large prey on screen. Half-Tail only ever managed to raise three cubs. Beauty (born in 1992) and Shadow (born in 1996) were her daughters and were both featured in the 1st series. She also raised a male cub called Mang'aa. Half-Tail had her sixth (final) litter of cubs in 1998 when she was nearly 11 years old but was killed when she attacked Maasai livestock. As her cubs were too young to feed themselves they died shortly afterwards. Shadow was to be the next leopard they followed and she went on to have a cub herself called Safi in 2000, who was rather shy of the cameras. Safi was born in January 2000. When the show returned in 2002, Shadow had a new litter of cubs. This was her 4th litter but, sadly, all of them died. In 2003 a new family was chosen, ending the line. Shadow was filmed briefly for ''Big Cat Week'', Series-3 in 2005 (broadcast in 2006); however the footage was not shown during that series. The footage would later air in a special documentary called ''The Big Story'' (10th anniversary celebration of ''Big Cat Diary'').\n\n====Bella====\nBella and her two cubs of 3 months old were found by presenter Saba Douglas-Hamilton in the 1st series of Big Cat Week in September,2003. Tiny Chui and his sister really provided a promising series. Months after filming ended, Chui's sister vanished. It later became clear she was dead, probably killed by lions. In 2005, the public and crew said goodbye to Chui and saw what should have been the final shots of them together, as he would leave Bella's side and protection sometime after filming. In October 2006, it was announced on their website that Chui had now been chased away by the resident male and Bella was now mating again. Chui has now been reported to have moved to a new territory downriver, where he was seen mating with a new female in Bella's adjacent territory. In Big Cat Live, viewers were introduced to Olive. Olive is Bella's daughter from 2000, before Chui was born. Olive has three cubs, one male, eight-month-old Kali, and two females, Ayah and Binti, independent from their mother. Bella, Olive, Ayah, Binti and Kali were nicknamed the \"Jackson Five\" after new presenter Jackson Looseyia, who was following their progress. The names Olive, Kali, Binti and Ayah were given to these leopards by Paul Kirui, veteran safari guide and a spotter for the leopard filming crew since 2006.  The \"Jackson Five\" is intriguing because three generations of these normally solitary cats are living together.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Looseyia posted on his blog a picture of Olive carrying a cub in her mouth. She has a new litter of cubs. Looseyia stated it would appear to be two cubs. Kali has been chased away by Olive. Bella has since died.\n\nOlive was killed by lions in September 2013.\n\n[[Mara Conservancy]] has recently spotted Chui in Mara. He moved to Mara about 6 years ago and is 10 years old now.\n\n==International broadcasters==\n* Australia - [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Ten Network]]\n* Bahrain - [[Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation|Bahrain 55]]\n* Belgium - [[E\u00e9n]]\n* Canada - [[Animal Planet (Canada)|Animal Planet]]\n* Estonia - [[Eesti Televisioon]]\n* France - [[France 5]]\n* Hong Kong - [[TVB Pearl]]\n* Japan - Animal Planet Japan\n* Mexico - [[Canal 40]]\n* Netherlands - [[Animal Planet]]\n* Portugal - [[Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o|SIC]]\n* Russia - [[Animal Planet]], [[TV Kultura]]\n* South Africa - [[M-Net]]\n* Sweden - [[Animal Planet (Europe)|Animal Planet]]\n* Taiwan - [[Animal Planet]] (\u52d5\u7269\u661f\u7403\u983b\u9053)\n* Thailand - [[IBC2]]\n* Turkey - [[TRT 1]]\n* United States - [[Animal Planet]]\n* India - [[Animal Planet India|Animal Planet]]\n\n==Related series==\nThe BBC Natural History Unit has used the diary format popularised by ''Big Cat Diary'' for a number of related series. They include:\n\n===''Elephant Diaries''===\n''Elephant Diaries'' went behind the scenes at a sanctuary for orphaned [[African bush elephant]]s run by the [[David Sheldrick]] Wildlife Trust. [[Michaela Strachan]] and Jonathan Scott presented both series, which were broadcast in 2005 and 2008.\n\n===''Orangutan Diary''===\nTwo series of ''[[Orangutan Diary]]'' were aired; the first was shown in April 2007. It was filmed at the [[Borneo Orangutan Survival|Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation]] and showed the lives of rescued orangutans. A second series was shown in 2009, consisting of six one-hour shows. Both series were presented by Michaela Strachan and [[Steve Leonard]].\n\n===''Big Bear Week''===\nPresenters followed the three species of bear native to North America for this one-off series. Jonathan Scott followed [[brown bear]]s in [[Alaska]], Saba Douglas-Hamilton observed [[polar bears]] in [[Churchill, Manitoba]] and Jeff Turner tracked [[American black bear]]s in [[British Columbia]]. They were all situated in different parts of Canada. ''Big Bear Week'' was broadcast in the summer of 2006 on BBC One, soon after the third series of ''Big Cat Week''.\n\n===''Chimp Week''===\nFilmed over eight years, ''Chimp Week'' followed the lives of two family groups of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in [[Tanzania]]. It was narrated by Jonathan Scott and broadcast in January 2006.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\nCurrently available on [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD are the 2004, 2005 and 2006 series of ''Big Cat Week'' (packaged as series 1 to 3, with series 1 and 2 being packaged together), the 2007 series of ''Big Cat Diary'' (packaged as series 4 of ''Big Cat Week'') and highlights from ''Big Cat Live'' (packaged as ''Big Cat Special''). There is also a trilogy of books written by Jonathan and Angela Scott, with each focusing on the stories concerning the lions, cheetahs and leopards of the 'Big Cat Diary' format of the show.\n\nIn 2012, Seasons 1 and 2 of the original ''Big Cat Diary'' show was made available to download on iTunes and Amazon's Instant Video services. These episodes are DVD quality or better, however no DVD or any other physical media are available for these two seasons.

Solo was born in 2000 and was featured in the 3rd series of ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2000 and later in 4th series in 2002.\n\n====Tamu====\nThe focus of the 2006 series, Tamu was a lone lioness with four cubs fathered by Notch of the Marsh Pride. In Swahili, her name means \"the beautiful one.\" Tamu was a social outcast and had to hunt and raise her cubs alone. When a solitary rogue male invaded her den, she escaped with only two cubs, one of whom was injured and later died. Tamu found her remaining cubs after two days of searching. The audience watched as Tamu and the cubs investigated, licked, and acknowledged the death of their sibling. After a day, Tamu moved her young into the heart of Marsh territory to a den area most frequented by the rest of the pride. This put her in danger of the Marsh Pride lionesses who tried to oust Tamu and her cubs.\n\n====The Big Pride====\n\nBig Pride is also known as Acacia Pride or Gorge Pride. Filmed in 1996 as the first series of the show, they had a large number of lions\u201428--but were not filmed in following series.\n\n=== Cheetahs in the hostile world===\n\n====Kidogo====\nIn the first series in 1996, the show followed first-time mother Kidogo and her two 12-week-old cubs. While most cheetahs hunt during the day, Kidogo hunted late in the day. In one of ''Big Cat Diary'''s few episodes filmed at night, Kidogo and cubs come dangerously close to hunting lions.\n\n====Fundi ====\nFundi was also part of the first series. Fundi hunted regularly in thick [[acacia]] trees to keep her two adolescent cubs well-fed, unusual for cheetahs who usually hunt on open plains. Fundi means \"craftsman\" in Swahili.\n\n====Amber (sometimes known as Queen)====\nAmber was first seen in the second series in September 1998 as mother to three cubs of 16 months old. She used cars as vantage points to spot danger or prey. She was last seen and filmed in later October 2000 during the third series of the show.\n\n====Kimbia====\nKimbia was the territorial male cheetah of Amber's home range, filmed in the third ''Big Cat Diary'' in September\u2013October 2000.\n\n====Kike====\nAmber's daughter Kike (pronounced \"Kee-Kay\") returned in the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' in September 2003. Discovered at Rhino Ridge, Kike was mother to three cubs of nearly 9 months old. This was Kike's fourth litter, but she had not previously raised a cub to adulthood. Like her mother Amber, Kike used jeeps as vantage points to watch for danger or prey. The three cubs went on to appear in the 2004's ''Big Cat Week''. In an October 2008 webcast of ''Big Cat Raw'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] suggested Kike had not been spotted recently and had probably died. He confirmed her three cubs had survived and that her daughter Itchy had raised cubs of her own. Itchy was filmed in the first series of [[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]], and it is believed that another daughter of hers, named Serena, is mother of Malaika, the cheetah.\n\n====Honey and Toto====\nHoney was first featured on ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2002 as a capable first time mother of three tiny 8 week old cubs. For 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', viewers were introduced to her young cub, Toto, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning \"the little one\". Honey was not mentioned on screen as Toto's mother because this was not known until after the series was filmed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/bcd/slideshows/cheetahs/honey.shtml BBC - Science & Nature - Big Cat Diary - Honey]</ref> When he was first filmed, it was estimated that Toto was only 6\u20138 weeks old, making him the youngest cheetah cub ever to be filmed on ''Big Cat Diary''. In the final episode of the series, Toto went missing overnight after a storm and was not found. It was reported a few days later that Honey was found living alone. The end credits that year consisted entirely of footage of Toto.\n\nHoney returned in the 2006 in the fourth series. When filming began, she had four cubs but one was soon lost in a lion attack. In February 2007, nearly a year before she last appeared on screen, Honey was killed after a vet accidentally shot her in the wrong place with a tranquilizer dart. The dart did not go into the muscle but hit her in the stomach near her kidneys.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-511955/Honey-star-Big-Cat-Diary-killed-vets-blunder.html ''The Daily Mail'': Honey, star of Big Cat Diary, killed by vet's blunder]</ref> Her three remaining cubs, Snap (M-1), Crackle (M-2) and Pop (M-3), were cared for by the [[Mara Conservancy]].<ref>[http://paul-kirui.blogspot.com/2009/03/cheetahs-kill-zebra.html Paul Kirui Blog]</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Honey's three now fully grown sons were filmed during ''Big Cat Live''. Crackle (M-2) was killed by lions in 2011 and just two years later in 2013, Pop (M-3) also became the victim of lions. Snap (M-1) was named as \"Mjuzi\" which means \"the last survivor\" in Swahili. He was last spotted in April 2013.\n\n====Shakira and Duma====\nIn 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] (while following the story of Honey and Toto) introduced viewers to Duma and her mother (later named Shakira). She was also featured in ''Big Cat Diary: Family Histories.'' In ''Big Cat Live'' in 2008, Shakira was filmed with five 2-month-old cubs. They were attacked by some of the lions of Marsh pride and two eventually died during the series (possibly killed by [[hyena]]s).\n\n=== The leopards of Mara ===\n\n====Leopard Gorge====\n''Big Cat Diary'' only followed one leopard family through each generation. This family started with Half-Tail, a 9-year-old female in 1996, one of the most famous big cats who appeared on the show for quite a few years. She was named Half-Tail after a clash with baboons or lions in which she lost half her tail. This incident happened in 1993 when she was about 6 years old. She is the only leopard in the show who was not shown killing any large prey on screen. Half-Tail only ever managed to raise three cubs. Beauty (born in 1992) and Shadow (born in 1996) were her daughters and were both featured in the 1st series. She also raised a male cub called Mang'aa. Half-Tail had her sixth (final) litter of cubs in 1998 when she was nearly 11 years old but was killed when she attacked Maasai livestock. As her cubs were too young to feed themselves they died shortly afterwards. Shadow was to be the next leopard they followed and she went on to have a cub herself called Safi in 2000, who was rather shy of the cameras. Safi was born in January 2000. When the show returned in 2002, Shadow had a new litter of cubs. This was her 4th litter but, sadly, all of them died. In 2003 a new family was chosen, ending the line. Shadow was filmed briefly for ''Big Cat Week'', Series-3 in 2005 (broadcast in 2006); however the footage was not shown during that series. The footage would later air in a special documentary called ''The Big Story'' (10th anniversary celebration of ''Big Cat Diary'').\n\n====Bella====\nBella and her two cubs of 3 months old were found by presenter Saba Douglas-Hamilton in the 1st series of Big Cat Week in September,2003. Tiny Chui and his sister really provided a promising series. Months after filming ended, Chui's sister vanished. It later became clear she was dead, probably killed by lions. In 2005, the public and crew said goodbye to Chui and saw what should have been the final shots of them together, as he would leave Bella's side and protection sometime after filming. In October 2006, it was announced on their website that Chui had now been chased away by the resident male and Bella was now mating again. Chui has now been reported to have moved to a new territory downriver, where he was seen mating with a new female in Bella's adjacent territory. In Big Cat Live, viewers were introduced to Olive. Olive is Bella's daughter from 2000, before Chui was born. Olive has three cubs, one male, eight-month-old Kali, and two females, Ayah and Binti, independent from their mother. Bella, Olive, Ayah, Binti and Kali were nicknamed the \"Jackson Five\" after new presenter Jackson Looseyia, who was following their progress. The names Olive, Kali, Binti and Ayah were given to these leopards by Paul Kirui, veteran safari guide and a spotter for the leopard filming crew since 2006.  The \"Jackson Five\" is intriguing because three generations of these normally solitary cats are living together.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Looseyia posted on his blog a picture of Olive carrying a cub in her mouth. She has a new litter of cubs. Looseyia stated it would appear to be two cubs. Kali has been chased away by Olive. Bella has since died.\n\nOlive was killed by lions in September 2013.\n\n[[Mara Conservancy]] has recently spotted Chui in Mara. He moved to Mara about 6 years ago and is 10 years old now.\n\n==Related series==\nThe BBC Natural History Unit has used the diary format popularised by ''Big Cat Diary'' for a number of related series. They include:\n\n===''Elephant Diaries''===\n''Elephant Diaries'' went behind the scenes at a sanctuary for orphaned [[African bush elephant]]s run by the [[David Sheldrick]] Wildlife Trust.
