Eunice's brother Phillip, a recent college graduate, comes home and announces that he has a chance to go to [[New York City]] in hopes of becoming a writer and has to leave that day. In the meantime, their mother [[Thelma Harper]] is frantic about Phillip going so spontaneously and is trying to get her husband Carl out of the bathroom to stop their son from leaving. Ed and Eunice have a fight on the porch because Ed doesn't want to go to the party. Ed storms off, they break up, and Eunice goes to the party.\n\n'''1963:''' Ed and Eunice are married and have two sons, Billy and [[Bubba Higgins|Bubba]]. Ed and Eunice come to Thelma's house to see Phillip who is visiting from New York. Phillip is now a bestselling author of a historical novel. He announces that a movie producer wants to make one of his books into a film. Carl had died years earlier and Thelma wants to visit his grave. Eunice, who wants to be an actress, wants to be in the film and wants to leave with Phillip.\n\n'''1973:''' Ed and Eunice are divorced and Phillip, who has won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], is visiting again, this time from [[Los Angeles]]. Although many of his books were made into movies, he decides this time to write the [[screenplay]] for a new film. Eunice still wants a part in Phillip's film. At the same time, Bubba, who has been missing for almost a year, calls to a frantic Eunice demanding to know where he is.\n\n'''1978:''' Eunice, Phillip and their sister Ellen come home from Thelma's funeral. The three siblings are discussing Thelma's death, the funeral and the future. Ed shows up to give his condolences, and seems to want to reconcile with Eunice, and after she agrees to give it a try, he mentions he had remarried, and it turns out he was really hoping to get Phillip to invest in his new hardware business. After Eunice throws Ed out, she then gets into an argument with Ellen, who storms out. Eunice, in a frenzy, finally breaks down yelling out for Thelma. In Thelma's bedroom, Phillip tells Eunice that the only thing stopping her from the life she wants to live is herself. Phillip convinces Eunice to spontaneously come to Los Angeles with him. She decides to leave with Phillip and in her excitement, she calls her aunt Ina to let her know what her plans are, but aunt Ina wants her to help her with her sore back and Eunice postpones her trip for a few days.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carol Burnett]] as [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]]\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as [[List of Mama's Family characters#Ed Higgins|Ed]]\n* [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper|Mama]]\n* [[Ken Berry]] as [[The Family (sketch)#Characters|Phillip]]\n* [[Betty White]] as [[List of Mama's Family characters#Ellen Harper|Ellen]]\n* [[Dick Clair]] as Carl (voice only)\n\n==Reception==\nLawrence was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for her role as Thelma Harper.\n\n==Home media==\n''Eunice'' was released as a bonus feature on ''Mama's Family: The Complete Second Season'' [[DVD]] set on September 10, 2013.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title| id= tt0285073 | title=Eunice}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eunice}}\n[[Category:1982 television films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:CBS network films]]\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1955]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1963]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1978]]\n[[Category:Television spin-offs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name           = Eunice\n| image          = \n| image_size     = \n| caption        = \n| director       = Roger Beatty and [[Harvey Korman]]\n| producer       = [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]]\n| writer         = [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]\n| starring       = [[Carol Burnett]]<br />[[Harvey Korman]]<br />[[Vicki Lawrence]]<br />[[Ken Berry]]<br />[[Betty White]]\n| music          = [[Peter Matz]]\n| location       = [[CBS Television City]]<br />Hollywood, California\n| company         = Joe Hamilton Productions\n| distributor    = [[Warner Bros.

For example, the endings -ado, -ido, -edo often drop intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} in both Seville and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]: hablado > hablao, vendido > vend\u00edo, dedo > deo (intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} dropping is quite widespread in coastal American dialects).\n\nAnother Andalusian trait is the tendency to weaken postvocalic consonants, particularly /-s/: 'los dos > lo(h) do(h), 'buscar' > buhc\u00e1(l) (aspiration or elimination of syllable-final /s/ is quite widespread in coastal American dialects).\n\nPronouncing \"l\" instead of \"r\" in syllable-final position is also a trait of Puerto Rican Spanish that has similarities in Spain: - Andalusians sometimes do the opposite, replacing the letter \"l\" at the end of a syllable with \"r\" (e.g. saying \"Huerva\" instead of \"[[Huelva]]\". \nPeople from working class areas of Seville can sometimes sound almost indistinguishable from Puerto Ricans ([[Zatu]], the singer of the band [[SFDK (band)|SFDK]] from the [[Pino Montano]] district of [[Seville]] being an example).  This distinction is the main way of distinguishing between the two accents when examples in the \"transition zone\" exist.\n\nNevertheless, [[Canarian Spanish]] (from [[Spain]]'s [[Canary Islands]]) made the major contribution to Puerto Rican Spanish, and can be considered the basis of the dialect and accent. Many Canarians came in hopes of establishing a better life in [[the Americas]]. Most Puerto Rican immigration in the early 19th century included people from the Canary Islands, who, like Puerto Ricans, had inherited most of their linguistic traits from Andalusia.\n\nCanarian influence is most present in the language of those Puerto Ricans who live in the central mountain region, who blended it with the remnant vocabulary of the [[Ta\u00edno]]. Canarian and Caribbean dialects share a similar intonation which, in general terms, means that stressed vowels are usually quite long. Puerto Rican and Canarian Spanish accents are strikingly similar. When visiting [[Tenerife]] or [[Las Palmas]], Puerto Ricans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow-Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago.\n\nLater in the 19th century other Spanish immigrants from [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Asturias]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] plus other European settlers\u2014mostly from [[France]] (including [[Corsica]]), [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Germany]], and even some [[overseas Chinese]]\u2014settled in Puerto Rico. Words from these regions and countries joined the linguistic stew.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float:right; border: 1px solid #88a; background-color: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 85%; margin: 0 15px; white-space: nowrap\"\n|- style=\"background-color: #ccf\" |\n!

This caused the rapid decline and almost complete destruction of the indigenous Ta\u00ednos within the first fifty years of exposure to the European explorers and colonists.\n\nA great number of [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]] words like hamaca <nowiki>(hammock</nowiki>), hurak\u00e1n (hurricane), and {{lang|es|tabaco}} (tobacco) came into general Spanish usage, similar to the employment of indigenous words on the North American mainland by the English-speaking colonists, i.e., maize (corn), moccasin (moccasin), moose (moose). Ta\u00edno names and/or Hispanicized Ta\u00edno names for geographic locations such as [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], Bayam\u00f3n, [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]], Can\u00f3vanas, Guaynabo, Gurabo, Jayuya, [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico|Luquillo]], Mayag\u00fcez, Moca, [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico|Naguabo]] and Vieques are to be found throughout Puerto Rico, again similar to the use of Native American words in respect to geographic locations on the North American mainland (Alabama, Connecticut, Dakota, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, [[Mississippi]], Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and [[Utah]]).\n\n===African influence===\nThe first [[Africa]]n slaves were brought to the island in the 16th century.  Although several African tribes have been recorded in Puerto Rico, it is the [[Kongo language|Kongo]] from Central Africa that is considered to have had the most influence on Puerto Rican Spanish.<ref>http://personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/borboz.pdf</ref> In the early colonial period many African slaves in Puerto Rico spoke [[Bozal Spanish]]. Words like ''gandul'' (pigeon pea), ''[[Fufu|fuf\u00fa]]'' (mashed plantains), and ''malanga'' (a root vegetable), are commonly used and are of African origin. There also is the Afro-Caribbean/West Indian influence, for example many words and expressions come from [[Patois language|patois]] and creolized languages from the neighboring islands.\n\n===United States influence and Puerto Rican Anglicisms===\nIn 1898, during the armed conflicts of the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]], Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as part of a peace treaty that brought the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] to a sudden conclusion. The [[United States Army]] and the early colonial administration tried to impose the [[American English|English]] language on island residents. Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except Spanish language courses) was English.\n\nConsequently, many American English words are now found in the Puerto Rican vocabulary. [[American English|English]] has had a fluctuating status as a second official language of the Island, depending on the political party in power at the moment. The majority of Puerto Ricans today do not speak English at home, and Spanish remains the mother tongue of Puerto Ricans, regardless of their political views.\n\nMany third and fourth generation Puerto Ricans who live in the United States borrow English words or phrases in mid-sentence in a phenomenon called [[code-switching]], sometimes characterized as [[Spanglish]]. Puerto Rican writer [[Giannina Braschi]] published the first Spanglish novel, ''Yo-Yo Boing!'', in 1998, a book that represents the code-switching linguistic style of some Latino immigrants in the United States.  However, this mixture of Spanish and English is simply an informal blending of languages, not a separate language or dialect, and is not a fundamental characteristic of Spanish or Puerto Rican culture.  It is merely an occasional convenience used by speakers who are very fluent in the two languages.\n\nPuerto Rico has representation in the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] and has its [[Academia_Puertorrique\u00f1a_de_la_Lengua_Espa\u00f1ola|own national academy]] along with the other Spanish-speaking countries of [[Hispanic America]].\n\n==Accent==\nPuerto Rican accents, both in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]], could be described as a reflection of [[Puerto Rico]]'s historical ethnic cultures.\n\nPuerto Rican Spanish, like the language of every other Spanish-speaking area, has its distinctive phonological features (\"accent\"), which derive from the indigenous, African, and European languages that came into contact during the history of the region. The accents of [[Rioplatense_Spanish|River Plate Spanish]] ([[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]), for example, were heavily influenced by the presence of [[Italy|Italians]] in those countries.\n\nIn the case of Puerto Rico, [[Spain|Spaniards]] arrived from many regions within Spain and brought with them their own regional dialects/accents. A large number of Spaniards came in particular from a region of southern Spain, [[Andalusia]], and many others arrived from Spain's islands off the coast of North Africa, known as the [[Canary Islands]]. When visiting Tenerife or Las Palmas (Islas Canarias, Spain), Puerto Ricans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago. It is the accents of those regions that were as the basis of the accent of Spanish that is spoken in Puerto Rico. (Rioplatense Spanish in Uruguay was once influenced by Canarian accents, like Puerto Rican and other Caribbean accents themselves)\n\nThe indigenous population of Ta\u00ednos left a great many words in the names of geographical areas of the Island (Jayuya, [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]], etc.), and others are used to name everyday items such as ''hamaca'' ('hammock') or to describe natural phenomena such as ''hurac\u00e1n'' ('hurricane').\n\n[[Black history in Puerto Rico|Africans in Puerto Rico]] were brought in as slave labor, mostly to work on coastal or lowland sugar plantations. They contributed a large number of words to colloquialisms and island cuisine, introduced words, and influenced the speech rhythms. That can be noticed by visiting the parts of the island where they have historically been present (almost exclusively along the coasts). Also, the Afro-Caribbean/West Indian patois/Creole linguistic presence is very strong and has influenced Puerto Rican culture, as is reflected in music (such as reggae) and culinary dishes.\n\n[[Chinese Puerto Rican]]s and other [[Asia]]ns who have established themselves in Puerto Rico also adopt the accent, but with a tinge of an East Asian.\n\nThe Puerto Rican accent is somewhat similar to the accents of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin, including [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], and those from the Caribbean/coastal regions of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]] (particularly to a non-Puerto Rican). However, any similarity will depend on the level of education of the Puerto Rican speaker and their immediate geographic location. It also continues to be extremely similar to the accent of the [[Canarian people|Canary Islanders]] and [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]] in southern Spain. Overall, most Puerto Ricans make an emphatic distinction between their accent and other Caribbean Spanish accents.\n\n===Features===\n;[[Seseo]]\n:Seseo refers to the pronunciation {{IPA|/s/}} of the sound written {{angbr|z}} or {{angbr|c}} (when ''soft''; that is, followed by an {{angbr|i}} or an {{angbr|e}}) like most other Hispanic American accents, whereas in most of Spain (except Andalusia and the Canary Islands) {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is used.  Examples: {{lang|es|zapato}} is {{IPA|/sa\u02c8pato/}}, not {{IPA|/\u03b8a\u02c8pato/}}; and {{lang|es|azul}} is {{IPA|/a\u02c8sul/}} not {{IPA|/a\u02c8\u03b8ul/}}.\n;Aspiration or elimination of the {{IPA|/s/}}\n:In syllable-final position, (i.e., before a consonant or at the end of a word), {{IPA|/s/}} is debuccalized to {{IPA|[h]}} ({{IPA|[\u0266]}} before voiced consonants) or eliminated altogether. Examples include {{IPA|[la\u0266 \u02c8rosah]}} instead of {{IPA|[laz \u02c8rosas]}} (las rosas, 'the roses') {{IPA|[lo\u0266 \u00f0oh]}} instead of {{IPA|[loz \u00f0os]}} (los dos, 'the two').  This is also common in other \"lowland Spanish\" areas (Caribbean basin, River Plate, Chile, etc.) and in the southern half of Spain.\n;Aspiration of {{IPA|/x/}}\n:{{IPA|/x/}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[h]}}: {{IPA|[la\u0266 mu\u02c8he\u027eeh]}} instead of {{IPA|[laz mu\u02c8xe\u027ees]}} (las mujeres, 'the women'), and {{IPA|[ho\u02c8se]}} instead of {{IPA|[xo\u02c8se]}} (Jos\u00e9, 'Joseph').\n;Elimination of {{IPA|/d/}} between vowels\n:/d/ under\u0261oes [[lenition]] to the point of complete deletion (/d/ > [\u00f0] > [\u00d8]): {{IPA|[eh\u02c8tao]}} instead of {{IPA|[es\u02c8ta\u00f0o]}} (estado, 'state'), and {{IPA|[\u02c8to.o]}} instead of {{IPA|[\u02c8to\u00f0o]}} ('all').\n;Elimination of {{IPA|/d/}} at the end of a word\n:In that case, a stress is usually placed on the final vowel. Examples include {{IPA|[pa\u02c8\u027ee]}} instead of {{IPA|[pa\u02c8\u027ee\u00f0]}} (pared, 'wall') and {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei]}} instead of {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u00f0]}} ([[Madrid]]).\n;Fricativization of {{IPA|/r/}} to {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}\n:Many rural Puerto Ricans do not roll their tongues on the ''double \"r\"'' sound in words (ex. ''\"arroz\"'' or ''\"carro\"''), making it sound like the Scottish ''loch'', ''arroz'' and ''carro'' are pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u03c7os]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8ka\u03c7o]}} respectively. However, it is mostly a free variant of /r/, making {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u03c7os]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8ka\u03c7o]}} interchangeable to {{IPA|[a\u02c8ros]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8karo]}} respectively.\n;Lateralization of {{IPA|/r/}} to {{IPA|[l]}}\n:The {{IPA|/r/}} that is the end of a syllable (not followed by a vowel) is often changed to an {{IPA|/l/}}, so that words like ''\"perd\u00f3n\"'' (forgiveness) and ''\"Puerto Rico\"'' become ''\"peld\u00f3n\"'' and ''\"Puelto Rico\"'' respectively.\n;Realization of syllable- and word-final {{IPA|/r/}}\n:Aside from {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, {{IPA|[r]}}, [\u03c7], and [l], syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} can be realized as {{IPAblink|\u0279}}, an influence of [[American English]] to Puerto Rican dialect; ''\"verso\"''' (verse) becomes {{IPA|[\u02c8be\u0279so]}}, aside from {{IPA|[\u02c8be\u027eso]}}, {{IPA|[\u02c8berso]}}, or {{IPA|[\u02c8belso]}}, \"''invierno''\" (winter) becomes {{IPA|[im\u02c8bje\u0279no]}}, aside from {{IPA|[im\u02c8bje\u027eno]}}, {{IPA|[im\u02c8bjerno]}}, or {{IPA|[im\u02c8bjelno]}}, and \"''parlamento''\" (parliament) becomes {{IPA|[pa\u0279la\u02c8mento]}}, aside from {{IPA|[pa\u027ela\u02c8mento]}}, {{IPA|[parla\u02c8mento]}}, or {{IPA|[pala\u02c8mento]}}. In word-final position, {{IPA|/r/}} will usually be:\n* either a trill, a tap, approximant, {{IPA|[l]}}, or elided when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[r ~ \u027e ~ \u0279 ~ l]}} ''paterno'' 'paternal love', ''amor'' {{IPA|[a\u02c8mo]}}),\n* a tap, approximant, or {{IPA|[l]}} when the followed by a vowel-initial word, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[\u027e~ \u0279 ~ l]}} ''eterno'' 'eternal love').\n;Retraction of {{IPA|/n/}} to {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n:Word-final {{IPA|/n/}} is pronounced as [[velar nasal|velar]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} ({{IPA|[\u014b]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before [[velar consonant]]s and word-final position), words include ''consideran'' {{IPA|[k\u00f5nsi\u02c8\u00f0e\u027e\u00e3\u014b]}} ('they consider') and ''Teher\u00e1n'' {{IPA|[tee\u02c8\u027e\u00e3\u014b]}} ('[[Tehran]]').\n;Shortening of words\n:Puerto Ricans also often shorten words by eliminating whole syllables. Examples are the words ''para'', ''madre'', and ''padre'' (\"for\", \"mother\", and \"father\"): Puerto Ricans may pronounce ''para'' as {{IPA|/pa/}}, ''madre'' as {{IPA|/mai/}}, and ''padre'' as {{IPA|/pai/}}.\n\n===Effects of Spanish-English contact and bilingualism===\nDuring the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the early colonial period, English was imposed on island residents. [[English_language_in_Puerto_Rico|English is currently an official governmental language on the island]], but rates of bilingualism in Puerto Rico (with varying degrees of proficiency in English) are modest.\n\nGiven the sustained contact between Spanish and English in Puerto Rico and on the mainland, bilingual Puerto Ricans may exhibit contact phenomena (code-switching, borrowing, etc.) in both their Spanish and English. \n\nPuerto Ricans descended from the large number of migrants who left the island throughout the 20th century can be found in numerous communities along the Eastern coast of the United States. In addition to major metropolitan areas such as New York, many Puerto Ricans also went to areas such as Connecticut, Chicago, Delaware, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, California, and Hawaii. Because of their high-rates of military enlistment, Puerto Rican communities are also found in other areas across the U.S. near military installations.\n\nThe accent of Spanish-speaking Puerto Ricans living in mainland U.S. may be influenced by their predominantly English-speaking surroundings. Speakers maintain features of Puerto Rican Spanish, and their accents can also show influences of the area of the United States where they grew up.

For example, the endings -ado, -ido, -edo often drop intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} in both Seville and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]: hablado > hablao, vendido > vend\u00edo, dedo > deo (intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} dropping is quite widespread in coastal American dialects).\n\nAnother Andalusian trait is the tendency to weaken postvocalic consonants, particularly /-s/: 'los dos > lo(h) do(h), 'buscar' > buhc\u00e1(l) (aspiration or elimination of syllable-final /s/ is quite widespread in coastal American dialects).\n\nPronouncing \"l\" instead of \"r\" in syllable-final position is also a trait of Puerto Rican Spanish that has similarities in Spain: - Andalusians sometimes do the opposite, replacing the letter \"l\" at the end of a syllable with \"r\" (e.g. saying \"Huerva\" instead of \"[[Huelva]]\". \nPeople from working class areas of Seville can sometimes sound almost indistinguishable from Puerto Ricans ([[Zatu]], the singer of the band [[SFDK (band)|SFDK]] from the [[Pino Montano]] district of [[Seville]] being an example).  This distinction is the main way of distinguishing between the two accents when examples in the \"transition zone\" exist.\n\nNevertheless, [[Canarian Spanish]] (from [[Spain]]'s [[Canary Islands]]) made the major contribution to Puerto Rican Spanish, and can be considered the basis of the dialect and accent. Many Canarians came in hopes of establishing a better life in [[the Americas]]. Most Puerto Rican immigration in the early 19th century included people from the Canary Islands, who, like Puerto Ricans, had inherited most of their linguistic traits from Andalusia.\n\nCanarian influence is most present in the language of those Puerto Ricans who live in the central mountain region, who blended it with the remnant vocabulary of the [[Ta\u00edno]]. Canarian and Caribbean dialects share a similar intonation which, in general terms, means that stressed vowels are usually quite long. Puerto Rican and Canarian Spanish accents are strikingly similar. When visiting [[Tenerife]] or [[Las Palmas]], Puerto Ricans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow-Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago.\n\nLater in the 19th century other Spanish immigrants from [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Asturias]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] plus other European settlers\u2014mostly from [[France]] (including [[Corsica]]), [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Germany]], and even some [[overseas Chinese]]\u2014settled in Puerto Rico. Words from these regions and countries joined the linguistic stew.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float:right; border: 1px solid #88a; background-color: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 85%; margin: 0 15px; white-space: nowrap\"\n|- style=\"background-color: #ccf\" |\n!

This caused the rapid decline and almost complete destruction of the indigenous Ta\u00ednos within the first fifty years of exposure to the European explorers and colonists.\n\nA great number of [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]] words like hamaca <nowiki>(hammock</nowiki>), hurak\u00e1n (hurricane), and {{lang|es|tabaco}} (tobacco) came into general Spanish usage, similar to the employment of indigenous words on the North American mainland by the English-speaking colonists, i.e., maize (corn), moccasin (moccasin), moose (moose). Ta\u00edno names and/or Hispanicized Ta\u00edno names for geographic locations such as [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], Bayam\u00f3n, [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]], Can\u00f3vanas, Guaynabo, Gurabo, Jayuya, [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico|Luquillo]], Mayag\u00fcez, Moca, [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico|Naguabo]] and Vieques are to be found throughout Puerto Rico, again similar to the use of Native American words in respect to geographic locations on the North American mainland (Alabama, Connecticut, Dakota, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, [[Mississippi]], Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and [[Utah]]).\n\n===African influence===\nThe first [[Africa]]n slaves were brought to the island in the 16th century.  Although several African tribes have been recorded in Puerto Rico, it is the [[Kongo language|Kongo]] from Central Africa that is considered to have had the most influence on Puerto Rican Spanish.<ref>http://personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/borboz.pdf</ref> In the early colonial period many African slaves in Puerto Rico spoke [[Bozal Spanish]]. Words like ''gandul'' (pigeon pea), ''[[Fufu|fuf\u00fa]]'' (mashed plantains), and ''malanga'' (a root vegetable), are commonly used and are of African origin. There also is the Afro-Caribbean/West Indian influence, for example many words and expressions come from [[Patois language|patois]] and creolized languages from the neighboring islands.\n\n===United States influence and Puerto Rican Anglicisms===\nIn 1898, during the armed conflicts of the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]], Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as part of a peace treaty that brought the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] to a sudden conclusion. The [[United States Army]] and the early colonial administration tried to impose the [[American English|English]] language on island residents. Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except Spanish language courses) was English.\n\nConsequently, many American English words are now found in the Puerto Rican vocabulary. [[American English|English]] has had a fluctuating status as a second official language of the Island, depending on the political party in power at the moment. The majority of Puerto Ricans today do not speak English at home, and Spanish remains the mother tongue of Puerto Ricans, regardless of their political views.\n\nMany third and fourth generation Puerto Ricans who live in the United States borrow English words or phrases in mid-sentence in a phenomenon called [[code-switching]], sometimes characterized as [[Spanglish]]. Puerto Rican writer [[Giannina Braschi]] published the first Spanglish novel, ''Yo-Yo Boing!'', in 1998, a book that represents the code-switching linguistic style of some Latino immigrants in the United States.  However, this mixture of Spanish and English is simply an informal blending of languages, not a separate language or dialect, and is not a fundamental characteristic of Spanish or Puerto Rican culture.  It is merely an occasional convenience used by speakers who are very fluent in the two languages.\n\nPuerto Rico has representation in the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] and has its [[Academia_Puertorrique\u00f1a_de_la_Lengua_Espa\u00f1ola|own national academy]] along with the other Spanish-speaking countries of [[Hispanic America]].\n\n==Accent==\nPuerto Rican accents, both in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]], could be described as a reflection of [[Puerto Rico]]'s historical ethnic cultures.\n\nPuerto Rican Spanish, like the language of every other Spanish-speaking area, has its distinctive phonological features (\"accent\"), which derive from the indigenous, African, and European languages that came into contact during the history of the region. The accents of [[Rioplatense_Spanish|River Plate Spanish]] ([[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]), for example, were heavily influenced by the presence of [[Italy|Italians]] in those countries.\n\nIn the case of Puerto Rico, [[Spain|Spaniards]] arrived from many regions within Spain and brought with them their own regional dialects/accents. A large number of Spaniards came in particular from a region of southern Spain, [[Andaluc\u00eda]], and many others arrived from Spain's islands off the coast of North Africa, known as the [[Canary Islands]]. When visiting Tenerife or Las Palmas (Islas Canarias, Spain), Puerto Ricans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago. It is the accents of those regions that were as the basis of the accent of Spanish that is spoken in Puerto Rico. (Rioplatense Spanish in Uruguay was once influenced by Canarian accents, like Puerto Rican and other Caribbean accents themselves)\n\nThe indigenous population of Ta\u00ednos left a great many words in the names of geographical areas of the Island (Jayuya, [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]], etc.), and others are used to name everyday items such as ''hamaca'' ('hammock') or to describe natural phenomena such as ''hurac\u00e1n'' ('hurricane').\n\n[[Black history in Puerto Rico|Africans in Puerto Rico]] were brought in as slave labor, mostly to work on coastal or lowland sugar plantations. They contributed a large number of words to colloquialisms and island cuisine, introduced words, and influenced the speech rhythms. That can be noticed by visiting the parts of the island where they have historically been present (almost exclusively along the coasts). Also, the Afro-Caribbean/West Indian patois/Creole linguistic presence is very strong and has influenced Puerto Rican culture, as is reflected in music (such as reggae) and culinary dishes.\n\n[[Chinese Puerto Rican]]s and other [[Asia]]ns who have established themselves in Puerto Rico also adopt the accent, but with a tinge of an East Asian.\n\nThe Puerto Rican accent is somewhat similar to the accents of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin, including [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], and those from the Caribbean/coastal regions of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]] (particularly to a non-Puerto Rican). However, any similarity will depend on the level of education of the Puerto Rican speaker and their immediate geographic location. It also continues to be extremely similar to the accent of the [[Canarian people|Canary Islanders]] and [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]] in southern Spain. Overall, most Puerto Ricans make an emphatic distinction between their accent and other Caribbean Spanish accents.\n\n===Features===\n;[[Seseo]]\n:Seseo refers to the pronunciation {{IPA|/s/}} of the sound written {{angbr|z}} or {{angbr|c}} (when ''soft''; that is, followed by an {{angbr|i}} or an {{angbr|e}}) like most other Hispanic American accents, whereas in most of Spain (except Andalusia and the Canary Islands) {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is used.  Examples: {{lang|es|zapato}} is {{IPA|/sa\u02c8pato/}}, not {{IPA|/\u03b8a\u02c8pato/}}; and {{lang|es|azul}} is {{IPA|/a\u02c8sul/}} not {{IPA|/a\u02c8\u03b8ul/}}.\n;Aspiration or elimination of the {{IPA|/s/}}\n:In syllable-final position, (i.e., before a consonant or at the end of a word), {{IPA|/s/}} is debuccalized to {{IPA|[h]}} ({{IPA|[\u0266]}} before voiced consonants) or eliminated altogether. Examples include {{IPA|[la\u0266 \u02c8rosah]}} instead of {{IPA|[laz \u02c8rosas]}} (las rosas, 'the roses') {{IPA|[lo\u0266 \u00f0oh]}} instead of {{IPA|[loz \u00f0os]}} (los dos, 'the two').  This is also common in other \"lowland Spanish\" areas (Caribbean basin, River Plate, Chile, etc.) and in the southern half of Spain.\n;Aspiration of {{IPA|/x/}}\n:{{IPA|/x/}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[h]}}: {{IPA|[la\u0266 mu\u02c8he\u027eeh]}} instead of {{IPA|[laz mu\u02c8xe\u027ees]}} (las mujeres, 'the women'), and {{IPA|[ho\u02c8se]}} instead of {{IPA|[xo\u02c8se]}} (Jos\u00e9, 'Joseph').\n;Elimination of {{IPA|/d/}} between vowels\n:/d/ under\u0261oes [[lenition]] to the point of complete deletion (/d/ > [\u00f0] > [\u00d8]): {{IPA|[eh\u02c8tao]}} instead of {{IPA|[es\u02c8ta\u00f0o]}} (estado, 'state'), and {{IPA|[\u02c8to.o]}} instead of {{IPA|[\u02c8to\u00f0o]}} ('all').\n;Elimination of {{IPA|/d/}} at the end of a word\n:In that case, a stress is usually placed on the final vowel. Examples include {{IPA|[pa\u02c8\u027ee]}} instead of {{IPA|[pa\u02c8\u027ee\u00f0]}} (pared, 'wall') and {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei]}} instead of {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u00f0]}} ([[Madrid]]).\n;Fricativization of {{IPA|/r/}} to {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}\n:Many rural Puerto Ricans do not roll their tongues on the ''double \"r\"'' sound in words (ex. ''\"arroz\"'' or ''\"carro\"''), making it sound like the Scottish ''loch'', ''arroz'' and ''carro'' are pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u03c7os]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8ka\u03c7o]}} respectively. However, it is mostly a free variant of /r/, making {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u03c7os]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8ka\u03c7o]}} interchangeable to {{IPA|[a\u02c8ros]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8karo]}} respectively.\n;Lateralization of {{IPA|/r/}} to {{IPA|[l]}}\n:The {{IPA|/r/}} that is the end of a syllable (not followed by a vowel) is often changed to an {{IPA|/l/}}, so that words like ''\"perd\u00f3n\"'' (forgiveness) and ''\"Puerto Rico\"'' become ''\"peld\u00f3n\"'' and ''\"Puelto Rico\"'' respectively.\n;Realization of syllable- and word-final {{IPA|/r/}}\n:Aside from {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, {{IPA|[r]}}, [\u03c7], and [l], syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} can be realized as {{IPAblink|\u0279}}, an influence of [[American English]] to Puerto Rican dialect; ''\"verso\"''' (verse) becomes {{IPA|[\u02c8be\u0279so]}}, aside from {{IPA|[\u02c8be\u027eso]}}, {{IPA|[\u02c8berso]}}, or {{IPA|[\u02c8belso]}}, \"''invierno''\" (winter) becomes {{IPA|[im\u02c8bje\u0279no]}}, aside from {{IPA|[im\u02c8bje\u027eno]}}, {{IPA|[im\u02c8bjerno]}}, or {{IPA|[im\u02c8bjelno]}}, and \"''parlamento''\" (parliament) becomes {{IPA|[pa\u0279la\u02c8mento]}}, aside from {{IPA|[pa\u027ela\u02c8mento]}}, {{IPA|[parla\u02c8mento]}}, or {{IPA|[pala\u02c8mento]}}. In word-final position, {{IPA|/r/}} will usually be:\n* either a trill, a tap, approximant, {{IPA|[l]}}, or elided when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[r ~ \u027e ~ \u0279 ~ l]}} ''paterno'' 'paternal love', ''amor'' {{IPA|[a\u02c8mo]}}),\n* a tap, approximant, or {{IPA|[l]}} when the followed by a vowel-initial word, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[\u027e~ \u0279 ~ l]}} ''eterno'' 'eternal love').\n;Retraction of {{IPA|/n/}} to {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n:Word-final {{IPA|/n/}} is pronounced as [[velar nasal|velar]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} ({{IPA|[\u014b]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before [[velar consonant]]s and word-final position), words include ''consideran'' {{IPA|[k\u00f5nsi\u02c8\u00f0e\u027e\u00e3\u014b]}} ('they consider') and ''Teher\u00e1n'' {{IPA|[tee\u02c8\u027e\u00e3\u014b]}} ('[[Tehran]]').\n;Shortening of words\n:Puerto Ricans also often shorten words by eliminating whole syllables. Examples are the words ''para'', ''madre'', and ''padre'' (\"for\", \"mother\", and \"father\"): Puerto Ricans may pronounce ''para'' as {{IPA|/pa/}}, ''madre'' as {{IPA|/mai/}}, and ''padre'' as {{IPA|/pai/}}.\n\n===Effects of Spanish-English contact and bilingualism===\nDuring the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the early colonial period, English was imposed on island residents. [[English_language_in_Puerto_Rico|English is currently an official governmental language on the island]], but rates of bilingualism in Puerto Rico (with varying degrees of proficiency in English) are modest.\n\nGiven the sustained contact between Spanish and English in Puerto Rico and on the mainland, bilingual Puerto Ricans may exhibit contact phenomena (code-switching, borrowing, etc.) in both their Spanish and English. \n\nPuerto Ricans descended from the large number of migrants who left the island throughout the 20th century can be found in numerous communities along the Eastern coast of the United States. In addition to major metropolitan areas such as New York, many Puerto Ricans also went to areas such as Connecticut, Chicago, Delaware, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, California, and Hawaii. Because of their high-rates of military enlistment, Puerto Rican communities are also found in other areas across the U.S. near military installations.\n\nThe accent of Spanish-speaking Puerto Ricans living in mainland U.S. may be influenced by their predominantly English-speaking surroundings. Speakers maintain features of Puerto Rican Spanish, and their accents can also show influences of the area of the United States where they grew up. As \"native bilinguals\", their Spanish may include phonological features of the variety of American English that they speak (see discussion of /r/ above).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Languages}}\n*[[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* [[List of Puerto Rican slang words and phrases]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===General===\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Navarro Tom\u00e1s\n  | first = Tom\u00e1s\n  | authorlink = Tom\u00e1s Navarro Tom\u00e1s\n  | title = El espa\u00f1ol en Puerto Rico: Contribuci\u00f3n a la geograf\u00eda ling\u00fc\u00edstica de Hispanoam\u00e9rica\n  | publisher = Universidad de Puerto Rico\n  | location= R\u00edo Piedras\n  | year = 1948 }}\n\n===Etymology===\n* [http://www.personal.psu.edu/jml34/Canary.htm ''The Spanish of the Canary Islands.''
