The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984.

The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]]. It is a superset of [[ASCII]], and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 and all the extra characters from Windows-1252 but in a totally different arrangement. The few printable characters that are in ISO 8859-1, but not in this set, are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers, including the last version of [[Internet Explorer for Mac]].\n\n=== Other ===\nDOS had [[code page 850]], which had all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 had (albeit in a totally different arrangement) plus the most widely used [[graphic character]]s from [[code page 437]].\n\nBetween 1989<ref name=\"HP82240B_1989\"/> and 2015,<!-- end of production of HP 50g, HP's last RPL calculator --> [[Hewlett-Packard]] used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators.

Yagoda also supervised the construction of the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]] with [[Naftaly Frenkel]], using penal labor from the [[GULAG]] system, during which 12,000\u201325,000 laborers died. He was involved in the Soviet  [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] programs and has been held partly accountable for the [[Holodomor|great famine]] in Ukraine.\n\nLike many Soviet NKVD officers who conducted political repression, Yagoda himself ultimately became a victim of the Purge. He was demoted from the directorship of the NKVD in favor of [[Nikolai Yezhov]] in 1936 and arrested in 1937. Charged with the crimes of [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], espionage, [[Trotskyism]] and conspiracy, Yagoda was a defendant at the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\"|Trial of the Twenty-One]], the last of the major Soviet show trials of the 1930s.

After Dzerzhinsky's appointment as chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy in January 1924, Yagoda became the deputy chief and the real manager of the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), as the chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] had little authority because of his serious illness. In 1924, he joined the USSR's head of government, [[Alexei Rykov]] on a ship tour of the Volga. An American journalist who was allowed to join them on the trip described Yagoda as \"a spare, slightly-tanned, trim looking, youngish officer\" adding that it was \"difficult to associate terror with the affable and modest person\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=I Dreamt Revolution|last=Reswick|first=William|publisher=Henry Regnery Company|year=1952|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=85}}</ref> By contrast, the chemist [[Vladimir Ipatieff]] met Yagoda briefly in Moscow in 1918 and thought that \"it was unusual for a young men in his early twenties to be so unpleasant. I felt then that it would be unlucky for me or anyone else ever to fall into his hands.\" When he saw him again in 1927, \"his appearance had changed considerably: he had grown fatter and looked much older and very dignified and important.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of a Chemist: Memoirs of Vladimir Ipatieff|last=Ipatieff|first=Vladimir|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1946|isbn=|location=Stanford, Ca|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Genrikh Yagoda and Ida Averbakh 1922.jpg|thumb|Genrikh Yagoda and his wife [[:ru:\u0410\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0445, \u0418\u0434\u0430 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|Ida Averbakh]], deputy prosecutor of Moscow, 30 September 1922.

[[Nikolai Bukharin]] claimed in a leaked private conversation in July 1928 that \"Yagoda and Trilisser are with us\", but once it became apparent that the right was losing the power struggle, Yagoda switched allegiance. In the contemptuous opinion of Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, Yagoda \"traded his personal views for the sake of his career\" and degenerated into a \"criminal\" and a \"miserable coward\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=This I Cannot Forget|last=Larina|first=Anna|publisher=Pandora|year=1993|isbn=0 04 440887 0|location=London|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref>\n[[File:1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda..jpg|thumb|1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda in Moscow.]]\nYagoda continued to be effective head of the OGPU until July 1931, when the little known Old Bolshevik [[Ivan Akulov]] was appointed First Deputy Chairman, and Yagoda was demoted to the post of Second Deputy.

Behind him is [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]\n\nOn 10 July 1934, two months after Menzhinsky's death, Joseph Stalin appointed Yagoda [[People's Commissar]] for Internal Affairs, a position that included the oversight of both the regular and the secret police, the [[NKVD]]. Yagoda worked closely with [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] in organizing the first [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Show Trial]], which resulted in the prosecution and subsequent execution of former Soviet politicians Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in August 1936 as part of Stalin's [[Great Purge]]. The [[Red Army]] high command was not spared and its ranks were thinned by Yagoda, as a precursor to the later and more extensive [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|purge in the Russian military]]. More than a quarter of a million people were arrested during the 1934\u20131935 period; the GULAG system was vastly expanded under his stewardship, and penal labor became a major developmental resource in the Soviet economy.\n\nStalin became increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's performance. In the middle of 1936, Stalin received a report from Yagoda detailing the unfavorable public reaction abroad to the show trials and the growing sympathy among the Soviet population for the executed defendants. The report enraged Stalin, interpreting it as Yagoda's advice to stop the show trials and in particular to abandon the planned purge of [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] and the former commander in chief of the Red Army. Stalin was already unhappy with Yagoda's services, mostly due to the mismanagement of Kirov's assassination and his failure to fabricate \"proofs\" of ties between Kamenev and Zinoviev and the [[Okhrana]] (the tsarist security organization).<ref>Brackman, Roman., [https://books.google.com/books?id=nA7YzQMzO9YC&pg=PA231 ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life''], London: Frank Cass Publishers (2001), p. 231</ref> As one Soviet official put it, \"The Boss forgets nothing.\"<ref>Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), pp. 295-296</ref>\n\nOn 25 September 1936, Stalin sent a telegram (co-signed by [[Andrei Zhdanov]]) to the members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. The telegram read:\n<blockquote>\n\"We consider it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be appointed to head the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs. ''Yagoda has obviously proved unequal to the task of exposing the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc.'' The [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] was four years late in this matter. All party heads and the most of the NKVD agents in the region are talking about this.\"<ref>Medvedev, Roy. ''Let History Judge'', New York (1971), p. 174</ref>\n</blockquote>\nA day later, he was replaced by Yezhov, who managed the main purges during 1937\u20131938. Yagoda was demoted to the post of [[People's Commissariat for Post and Telegraph|People's Commissar for Post and Telegraph]].\n\n===Arrest, trial, and execution===\nIn March 1937, Yagoda was arrested on Stalin's orders. Yezhov announced Yagoda's arrest for diamond smuggling, corruption, and working as a German agent since joining the party in 1917. Yezhov even blamed Yagoda of an attempt to assassinate him by sprinkling [[mercury (element)|mercury]] around his office. He was accused of poisoning [[Maxim Gorky]] and his son. It was discovered that Yagoda's two Moscow apartments and his [[dacha]] contained 3,904 [[Pornography|pornographic]] photos, 11 pornographic films, 165 pornographically carved pipes, one [[dildo]], and the two bullets that killed Zinoviev and Kamenev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=195}} Yezhov took over the apartments. He had spent four million [[ruble]]s decorating his three homes, boasting that his garden had \"2,000 orchids and roses.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=85}}\n\nYagoda was found guilty of [[treason]] and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against the Soviet government at the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\"|Trial of the Twenty-One]] in March 1938.

Appointed by [[Joseph Stalin]], Yagoda supervised the arrest, [[Moscow Show Trial|show trials]], and executions of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], climactic events of the [[Great Purge]]. Yagoda also supervised the construction of the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]] with [[Naftaly Frenkel]], using penal labor from the [[GULAG]] system, during which 12,000\u201325,000 laborers died. He was involved in the Soviet  [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] programs and has been held partly accountable for the [[Holodomor|great famine]] in Ukraine.\n\nLike many Soviet NKVD officers who conducted political repression, Yagoda himself ultimately became a victim of the Purge. He was demoted from the directorship of the NKVD in favor of [[Nikolai Yezhov]] in 1936 and arrested in 1937.

After Dzerzhinsky's appointment as chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy in January 1924, Yagoda became the deputy chief and the real manager of the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), as the chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] had little authority because of his serious illness. In 1924, he joined the USSR's head of government, [[Alexei Rykov]] on a ship tour of the Volga. An American journalist who was allowed to join them on the trip described Yagoda as \"a spare, slightly-tanned, trim looking, youngish officer\" adding that it was \"difficult to associate terror with the affable and modest person\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=I Dreamt Revolution|last=Reswick|first=William|publisher=Henry Regnery Company|year=1952|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=85}}</ref> By contrast, the chemist [[Vladimir Ipatieff]] met Yagoda briefly in Moscow in 1918 and thought that \"it was unusual for a young men in his early twenties to be so unpleasant. I felt then that it would be unlucky for me or anyone else ever to fall into his hands.\" When he saw him again in 1927, \"his appearance had changed considerably: he had grown fatter and looked much older and very dignified and important.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of a Chemist: Memoirs of Vladimir Ipatieff|last=Ipatieff|first=Vladimir|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1946|isbn=|location=Stanford, Ca|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Genrikh Yagoda and Ida Averbakh 1922.jpg|thumb|Genrikh Yagoda and his wife [[:ru:\u0410\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0445, \u0418\u0434\u0430 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|Ida Averbakh]], deputy prosecutor of Moscow, 30 September 1922.

[[Nikolai Bukharin]] claimed in a leaked private conversation in July 1928 that \"Yagoda and Trilisser are with us\", but once it became apparent that the right was losing the power struggle, Yagoda switched allegiance. In the contemptuous opinion of Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, Yagoda \"traded his personal views for the sake of his career\" and degenerated into a \"criminal\" and a \"miserable coward\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=This I Cannot Forget|last=Larina|first=Anna|publisher=Pandora|year=1993|isbn=0 04 440887 0|location=London|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref>\n[[File:1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda..jpg|thumb|1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda in Moscow.]]\nYagoda continued to be effective head of the OGPU until July 1931, when the little known Old Bolshevik [[Ivan Akulov]] was appointed First Deputy Chairman, and Yagoda was demoted to the post of Second Deputy.

Behind him is [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]\n\nOn 10 July 1934, two months after Menzhinsky's death, Joseph Stalin appointed Yagoda [[People's Commissar]] for Internal Affairs, a position that included the oversight of both the regular and the secret police, the [[NKVD]]. Yagoda worked closely with [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] in organizing the first [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Show Trial]], which resulted in the prosecution and subsequent execution of former Soviet politicians Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in August 1936 as part of Stalin's [[Great Purge]]. The [[Red Army]] high command was not spared and its ranks were thinned by Yagoda, as a precursor to the later and more extensive [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|purge in the Russian military]]. More than a quarter of a million people were arrested during the 1934\u20131935 period; the GULAG system was vastly expanded under his stewardship, and penal labor became a major developmental resource in the Soviet economy.\n\nStalin became increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's performance. In the middle of 1936, Stalin received a report from Yagoda detailing the unfavorable public reaction abroad to the show trials and the growing sympathy among the Soviet population for the executed defendants. The report enraged Stalin, interpreting it as Yagoda's advice to stop the show trials and in particular to abandon the planned purge of [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] and the former commander in chief of the Red Army. Stalin was already unhappy with Yagoda's services, mostly due to the mismanagement of Kirov's assassination and his failure to fabricate \"proofs\" of ties between Kamenev and Zinoviev and the [[Okhrana]] (the tsarist security organization).<ref>Brackman, Roman., [https://books.google.com/books?id=nA7YzQMzO9YC&pg=PA231 ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life''], London: Frank Cass Publishers (2001), p. 231</ref> As one Soviet official put it, \"The Boss forgets nothing.\"<ref>Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), pp. 295-296</ref>\n\nOn 25 September 1936, Stalin sent a telegram (co-signed by [[Andrei Zhdanov]]) to the members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. The telegram read:\n<blockquote>\n\"We consider it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be appointed to head the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs. ''Yagoda has obviously proved unequal to the task of exposing the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc.'' The [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] was four years late in this matter. All party heads and the most of the NKVD agents in the region are talking about this.\"<ref>Medvedev, Roy. ''Let History Judge'', New York (1971), p. 174</ref>\n</blockquote>\nA day later, he was replaced by Yezhov, who managed the main purges during 1937\u20131938. Yagoda was demoted to the post of [[People's Commissariat for Post and Telegraph|People's Commissar for Post and Telegraph]].\n\n===Arrest, trial, and execution===\nIn March 1937, Yagoda was arrested on Stalin's orders. Yezhov announced Yagoda's arrest for diamond smuggling, corruption, and working as a German agent since joining the party in 1917. Yezhov even blamed Yagoda of an attempt to assassinate him by sprinkling [[mercury (element)|mercury]] around his office. He was accused of poisoning [[Maxim Gorky]] and his son. It was discovered that Yagoda's two Moscow apartments and his [[dacha]] contained 3,904 [[Pornography|pornographic]] photos, 11 pornographic films, 165 pornographically carved pipes, one [[dildo]], and the two bullets that killed Zinoviev and Kamenev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=195}} Yezhov took over the apartments. He had spent four million [[ruble]]s decorating his three homes, boasting that his garden had \"2,000 orchids and roses.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=85}}\n\nYagoda was found guilty of [[treason]] and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against the Soviet government at the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\"|Trial of the Twenty-One]] in March 1938. He denied he was a spy, but admitted most other charges.<ref>{{cite book|title=Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet 'Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites'|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.150911|publisher=People's Commissariat of Justice of the USSR|year=1938|location=Moscow|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.150911/page/n570 573]}}</ref> [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]] describes Yagoda as expecting [[clemency]] from Stalin after the show trial: \"Just as though Stalin had been sitting right there in the hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: 'I appeal to you! ''For you'' I built two great canals!'  And a witness reports that at just that moment a match flared in the shadows behind a window on the second floor of the hall, apparently behind a muslin curtain, and, while it lasted, the outline of a pipe could be seen.\"<ref>See Aleksandr I.

Yagoda was the only defendant not to be posthumously rehabilitated.\n\n=== Family ===\nYagoda's father, Grigori, the jeweller, who was aged 78 in 1938, wrote to Stalin disowning 'our only surviving son because of his 'grave crimes', which was not enough to save him, or his wife, from being arrested and dying in labour camps. {{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=224}}\n\nYagoda had two brothers. One was killed during the suppression of the revolt in Sormovo in 1905; the other was shot for taking part in a mutiny in a regiment during the war with Germany. Their sister, Lilya, was arrested on 7 May 1937, and shot on 16 July. She was photographed before her execution, as was normal for condemned prisoners. That photograph was retrieved from KGB archives and published in the book ''Ordinary Citizens'' by David King.<ref>{{cite book|last1=King|first1=David|title=Ordinary Citizens, the Victims of Stalin|date=2003|publisher=Francis Boutle|location=London|isbn=1 903427 150|page=142}}</ref>\n\nYagoda's wife was Ida Averbakh, one of whose uncles, [[Yakov Sverdlov]], was a prominent Bolshevik, and another, [[Zinovy Peshkov]], was the adopted son of the writer [[Maxim Gorky]]. She was shot in 1938.  Her brother, [[Leopold Averbakh]], was shot in August 1937.
