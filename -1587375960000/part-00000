Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n==As an equation==\nAccording to Taylor's original version of the rule, the nominal interest rate should respond to\ndivergences of actual inflation rates  from ''target'' inflation rates and of actual [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) from ''potential'' GDP:\n\n:<math>i_t = \\pi_t + r_t^* + a_\\pi  ( \\pi_t - \\pi_t^* )  + a_y ( y_t - \\bar y_t ).</math>\n\nIn this equation, <math>\\,i_t\\,</math> is the target short-term [[nominal interest rate]] (e.g. the [[Federal funds rate|federal funds rate]] in the US, the [[Official bank rate|Bank of England base rate]] in the UK), <math>\\,\\pi_t\\,</math> is the rate of [[inflation]] as measured by the [[GDP deflator]], <math>\\pi^*_t</math> is the desired rate of inflation, <math>r_t^*</math> is the assumed equilibrium real interest rate, <math>\\,y_t\\,</math> is the logarithm of real [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], and <math>\\bar y_t</math> is the logarithm of [[potential output]], as determined by a linear trend.\n\nIn this equation, both <math>a_{\\pi}</math> and <math>a_y</math> should be positive (as a rough rule of thumb, Taylor's 1993 paper proposed setting <math>a_{\\pi}=a_y=0.5</math>).<ref>Athanasios Orphanides (2008). \"Taylor rules,\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. v. 8, pp. 2000-2004, equation (7).[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_T000215&q=taylor%20rules&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>  That is, the rule \"recommends\" a relatively high interest rate (a \"tight\" monetary policy) when inflation is above its target or when output is above its [[full employment|full-employment]] level, in order to reduce inflationary pressure.  It recommends a relatively low interest rate (\"easy\" monetary policy) in the opposite situation, to stimulate output.  Sometimes monetary policy goals may conflict, as in the case of [[stagflation]], when inflation is above its target while output is below full employment. In such a situation, a Taylor rule specifies the relative weights given to reducing inflation versus increasing output.\n\n==The Taylor principle==\nBy specifying <math>a_{\\pi}>0</math>, the Taylor rule says that an increase in inflation by one percentage point should prompt the [[central bank]] to raise the [[nominal interest rate]] by more than one percentage point (specifically, by <math>1+a_{\\pi}</math>, the sum of the two coefficients on <math>\\pi_t</math> in the equation above). Since the [[real interest rate]] is (approximately) the nominal interest rate minus inflation, stipulating <math>a_{\\pi}>0</math> implies that when inflation rises, the [[real interest rate]] should be increased.  The idea that the nominal interest rate should be raised \"more than one-for-one\" to cool the economy when inflation increases (that is increasing the real interest rate) has sometimes been called the Taylor principle.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Generalizing the Taylor Principle |first=Troy |last=Davig |first2=Eric M. |last2=Leeper |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=97 |issue=3 |year=2007 |pages=607\u2013635 |jstor=30035014 |doi=10.1257/aer.97.3.607|url=https://caepr.indiana.edu/RePEc/inu/caeprp/CAEPR2006-001.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== The historical perspective ==\nThe policy rule emerged in the era of the broad debate on the policy rules versus discretion. The discourse among economists and policymakers started at the beginning of the 19th century. The first forum for debate was launched in the 1920s by the House Committee on Banking and Currency. In the hearing on the Strong bill in 1923, the conflict in the views on the monetary policy clearly appeared. Congressman Governor Strong, supported by John R. Commons and Irving Fisher, was highly concerned about the practices uses by the FED to control the price stability. In his opinion, [[the FED]] policy regarding the price level was unstable and could not guarantee long-term stability. After the death of the congressman, a political debate on changing the FED\u2019s policy was suspended. The FED was highly influenced by the New York Bank.\n\nOnly after the Great Depression hit the country, the FED policies started to be debated again. Irving Fisher compressed that \u201cthis depression was almost wholly preventable and that it would have been prevented if Governor Strong had lived, who was conducting open-market operations with a view of bringing about stability\u201d.<ref>Robert L. Hetzel, The Rules versus discretion debate over monetary policy in the 1920</ref> Later on, such monetarists as Friedman and Schwartz, confirmed that the economic dichotomy and the high inflation could be bypassed if the FED followed more precise the constant-money-rule.<ref>Frederic S. Mishkin, Monetary Policy Strategy Lessons from the Crisis National Bureau of Economic Research Cambridge MA 02138 February 2011</ref>\n\nThe recession in the US in the 1960s was accompanied by relatively high-interest rate. After Bretton Woods collapse the policy-makers were focused on keeping a low-interest rate, which had a negative impact on inventory process and resulted in the Great Inflation of 1970.\n\nSince the mid-1970s monetary targets have been used in many countries to state targets for inflation. Many advanced economies, such as the US and the UK, their policy rates were broadly consistent with the Taylor rule in the period of the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d between the mid-1980s and early 2000s. The Great moderation period was characterized by the limited inflation and stability of prices. In light of the Taylor rule, many central banks started to adjust their policies. The first mover was New Zeeland, where the inflation target was introduced in 1984. The Reserve Bank of New Zeeland was reformed to prioritize the price stability, besides, it gained more independence. After that, the Bank of Canada in 1991 and by 1994 the banks of Sweden, Finland, Australia, Spain, Israel and Chile were given the mandate to target inflation.<ref>Pier Francesco Asso, George A. Kahn, and Robert Leeson, The Taylor Rule and the Practice of Central Banking (February 2010), The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</ref>\n\nHowever, since the 2000s the actual interest rate in advanced economies, especially in the US, was below the suggested by the Taylor rule. The deviation can be explained by the fact that the central banks were supposed to mitigate the outcomes of financial busts but should intervene only when there are inflation expectations. The economics shocks were accompanied by the fall of the interest rate.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref>\n\n==Alternative versions of the rule==\n[[File:Taylor Rule Prescriptions for Fed Funds Rate 2016.png|thumb|350px|right|Effective federal funds rate and prescriptions from alternate versions of the Taylor Rule]]\nWhile the Taylor principle has proved very influential, there is more debate about the other terms that should enter into the rule. According to some simple [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian]] macroeconomic models, insofar as the central bank keeps inflation stable, the degree of fluctuation in output will be optimized (Blanchard and Gali call this property the '[[divine coincidence]]'). In this case, the central bank does not need to take fluctuations in the output gap into account when setting interest rates (that is, it may optimally set <math>a_y=0</math>.) On the other hand, other economists have proposed including additional terms in the Taylor rule to take into account financial conditions: for example, the interest rate might be raised when stock prices, housing prices, or interest rate spreads increase.\n\n* Taylor Rule 1993 - the original definition by John Taylor with <math>a_{\\pi} = a_y = 0.5</math>\n* Taylor Rule 1999 - adapted and updated by John Taylor in a new research paper: <math>a_{\\pi} = 0.5, a_y \\ge 0</math>\n\n== Alternative theories ==\n'''''Solvency rule''''': the alternative theory to the Taylor equitation. The new perspective on the rule was presented by Emiliano Brancaccio after the financial crises of 2008. The Taylor rule can bee is seen in the light of solvency and capital controls.<ref>Emiliano Brancaccio, Giuseppe Fontana, The Global Economic Crisis. (2011), Routledge, Oxon OX14 4RN</ref> The inflation target and output gap are neglected, while the interest rate is put under the conditionality to the solvency of workers and firms that represent financial stability. Opposite to stricter Taylor rule the solvency rule represents more a benchmark than a mechanistic formula.<ref>Emiliano Brancaccio and Giuseppe Fontana, \u2018Solvency rule\u2019 versus \u2018Taylor rule\u2019: an alternative interpretation of the relation between monetary policy and the economic crisis (August 2012 ), Cambridge Journal of Economics</ref>\n\n'''''[[McCallum rule]]''''': The rule created by economist Bennett T. McCallum at the end of the 20th-century targets the nominal gross domestic products. In the idea of McCallum the FED should stabilize the nominal GDP to achieve economic stability. Although the same monetary policy objectives can be reached by McCallum rule as by Taylor rule, the McCallum rule uses the precise financial data.<ref>Michael F. Gallmeyer Burton Hollifield Stanley E. Zin, Taylor Rules, McCallum Rules and the term structure of interest rates (April 2005), National Bureau Of Economic Research 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138</ref> Thus, the McCallum rule can overcome the problem of the unobservable variables.

The ECB\n\n==Empirical relevance==\nAlthough the [[Federal Reserve]] does not explicitly follow the Taylor rule, many analysts have argued that the rule provides a fairly accurate summary of US monetary policy under [[Paul Volcker]] and [[Alan Greenspan]].<ref name=\"Clarida 2000\">{{cite journal |last=Clarida |first=Richard |first2=Jordi |last2=Gal\u00ed |first3=Mark |last3=Gertler |year=2000 |title=Monetary Policy Rules and Macroeconomic Stability: Theory and Some Evidence |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=147\u2013180 |doi=10.1162/003355300554692 |jstor=2586937 |citeseerx=10.1.1.111.7984 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Lowenstein |first=Roger |title=The Education of Ben Bernanke | newspaper=The New York Times |date=2008-01-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20Ben-Bernanke-t.html}}</ref>Similar observations have been made about central banks in other developed economies, both in countries like Canada and New Zealand that have officially adopted inflation targeting rules, and in others like [[Germany]] where the [[Bundesbank]]'s policy did not officially target the inflation rate.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bernanke |first=Ben |first2=Ilian |last2=Mihov |year=1997 |title=What Does the Bundesbank Target? |journal=[[European Economic Review]] |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1025\u20131053 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(96)00056-6 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w5764.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Clarida |first=Richard |first2=Mark |last2=Gertler |first3=Jordi |last3=Gal\u00ed |year=1998 |title=Monetary Policy Rules in Practice: Some International Evidence |journal=European Economic Review |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1033\u20131067 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(98)00016-6 |url=http://papers.nber.org/papers/w6254.pdf }}</ref> This observation has been cited by [[Richard Clarida|Clarida]], [[Jordi Gal\u00ed|Gal\u00ed]], and [[Mark Gertler (economist)|Gertler]] as a reason why inflation had remained under control and the economy had been relatively stable (the so-called '[[Great Moderation]]') in most developed countries from the 1980s through the 2000s.<ref name=\"Clarida 2000\" /> However, according to Taylor, the rule was not followed in part of the 2000s, possibly leading to the housing bubble.<ref>{{cite paper |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~johntayl/FCPR.pdf |title=The Financial Crisis and the Policy Responses: An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong |first=John B. |last=Taylor |year=2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=John B. |year=2009 |title=Getting Off Track: How Government Actions and Interventions Caused, Prolonged, and Worsened the Financial Crisis |location= |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |isbn=978-0-8179-4971-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gettingofftrackh00tayl }}</ref> Certain research has determined that some households form their expectations about the future path of interest rates, inflation, and unemployment in a way that is consistent with Taylor-type rules.<ref>{{cite paper |work=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2012-01 |title=Do People Understand Monetary Policy? |first=Carlos |last=Carvalho |first2=Fernanda |last2=Nechio |year=2013 |ssrn=1984321 }}</ref>\n\n== Limitation of the Taylor rule ==\nThe Taylor rule is highly debated in the discourse of the rules vs. discretion. There are a few main limitations of the Taylor rule.\n\n1) ''Technical reasons.'' For the economic models, the period of 4 months was widely used, however, the period is not accurate to track the real changes in price, and this period is too long for setting the fixed interest rate.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905)</ref> Besides, the formulate incorporates the unobservable parameters can be easily misevaluated.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref> For example, the output-gap could not be precisely estimated by any bank.\n\n2) ''The inaccuracy of predictable variables'', such as the inflation and output gap that depend on the different scenarios of economic development. 3) ''Difficulty to assess the state of the economy in real-time'' 4) ''The discretionary optimization'' that leads to stabilization bias and a lack of history dependence.<ref>Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n5) ''The limited number of factors in the model.'' The model does not outlook the financial parameters. Thus, in the period of the financial boost the Taylor rule might tend to underestimate the interest rate, and opposite, during the financial busts overestimate.\n\n6) ''Does not reflect the usability of other monetary policy instruments'' such as reserve funds adjustment, balance sheet policies.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref>\n\n7) ''The relationship between the interest rate and aggregate demand is questioning'' by Kriesler and Lanoie, 2007.<ref>Emiliano Brancaccio and Giuseppe Fontana, \u2018Solvency rule\u2019 versus \u2018Taylor rule\u2019: an alternative interpretation of the relation between monetary policy and the economic crisis (August 2012 ), Cambridge Journal of Economics</ref>\n\nHowever, Taylor in his economic work highlighted that the rule should not be implicated mechanically: \u201c\u2026There will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors.\u201d On another hand, the Taylor rule is opposed to the discretion approach since it aimed to overcome the limitation of the purely discretionary approach.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905</ref> Hence, although the Taylor rule gives the room for manoeuvre, it is encouraged to treat the Taylor rule as a policy rule that required the strict implementation of the policy based on the incoming economic parameters.\n\n==Criticisms==\n[[Athanasios Orphanides]] (2003) claims that the Taylor rule can misguide policy makers since they face [[real-time data]]. He shows that the Taylor rule matches the US funds rate less perfectly when accounting for these informational limitations and that an activist policy following the Taylor rule would have resulted in an inferior macroeconomic performance during the Great Inflation of the seventies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orphanides |first=A. |year=2003 |title=The Quest for Prosperity without Inflation |journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=633\u2013663 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3932(03)00028-X |citeseerx=10.1.1.196.7048 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, financial manager [[Bill H.

On the other hand, other economists have proposed including additional terms in the Taylor rule to take into account financial conditions: for example, the interest rate might be raised when stock prices, housing prices, or interest rate spreads increase.\n\n* Taylor Rule 1993 - the original definition by John Taylor with <math>a_{\\pi} = a_y = 0.5</math>\n* Taylor Rule 1999 - adapted and updated by John Taylor in a new research paper: <math>a_{\\pi} = 0.5, a_y \\ge 0</math>\n\n'''''Solvency rule''''': the alternative theory to the Taylor equitation. The new perspective on the rule was presented by Emiliano Brancaccio after the financial crises of 2008. The Taylor rule can bee is seen in the light of solvency and capital controls.<ref>Emiliano Brancaccio, Giuseppe Fontana, The Global Economic Crisis. (2011), Routledge, Oxon OX14 4RN</ref> The inflation target and output gap are neglected, while the interest rate is put under the conditionality to the solvency of workers and firms that represent financial stability.

McCallum at the end of the 20th-century targets the nominal gross domestic products. In the idea of McCallum the FED should stabilize the nominal GDP to achieve economic stability. Although the same monetary policy objectives can be reached by McCallum rule as by Taylor rule, the McCallum rule uses the precise financial data.<ref>Michael F.

There are a few main limitations of the Taylor rule.\n\n1) ''Technical reasons.'' For the economic models, the period of 4 months was widely used, however, the period is not accurate to track the real changes in price, and this period is too long for setting the fixed interest rate.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905)</ref> Besides, the formulate incorporates the unobservable parameters can be easily misevaluated.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref> For example, the output-gap could not be precisely estimated by any bank.\n\n2) ''The inaccuracy of predictable variables'', such as the inflation and output gap that depend on the different scenarios of economic development. 3) ''Difficulty to assess the state of the economy in real-time'' 4) ''The discretionary optimization'' that leads to stabilization bias and a lack of history dependence.<ref>Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n5) ''The limited number of factors in the model.'' The model does not outlook the financial parameters. Thus, in the period of the financial boost the Taylor rule might tend to underestimate the interest rate, and opposite, during the financial busts overestimate.\n\n6) ''Does not reflect the usability of other monetary policy instruments'' such as reserve funds adjustment, balance sheet policies.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref>\n\n7) ''The relationship between the interest rate and aggregate demand is questioning'' by Kriesler and Lanoie, 2007.<ref>Emiliano Brancaccio and Giuseppe Fontana, \u2018Solvency rule\u2019 versus \u2018Taylor rule\u2019: an alternative interpretation of the relation between monetary policy and the economic crisis (August 2012 ), Cambridge Journal of Economics</ref>\n\nHowever, Taylor in his economic work highlighted that the rule should not be implicated mechanically: \u201c\u2026There will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors.\u201d On another hand, the Taylor rule is opposed to the discretion approach since it aimed to overcome the limitation of the purely discretionary approach.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905</ref> Hence, although the Taylor rule gives the room for manoeuvre, it is encouraged to treat the Taylor rule as a policy rule that required the strict implementation of the policy based on the incoming economic parameters.\n\n==Criticisms==\n[[Athanasios Orphanides]] (2003) claims that the Taylor rule can misguide policy makers since they face [[real-time data]]. He shows that the Taylor rule matches the US funds rate less perfectly when accounting for these informational limitations and that an activist policy following the Taylor rule would have resulted in an inferior macroeconomic performance during the Great Inflation of the seventies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orphanides |first=A. |year=2003 |title=The Quest for Prosperity without Inflation |journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=633\u2013663 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3932(03)00028-X |citeseerx=10.1.1.196.7048 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, financial manager [[Bill H.

Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue.<ref>Staples, Ariadne, ''From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion'', Routledge, 1998, pp. 12, 15\u201316, 24 \u2013 26, 149 \u2013 150: [[Varro]]'s theology identifies Venus with water as an aspect of the female principle.

Roman tradition made Venus the mother and protector of the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]], ancestor of the Roman people. Soon after, Rome's defeat of Carthage confirmed Venus's goodwill to Rome, her links to its mythical Trojan past, and her support of its political and military hegemony.<ref>Venus' links with Troy can be traced to the epic, mythic history of the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Judgement of Paris]], in which the Trojan prince [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose Aphrodite over [[Hera]] and [[Athena]], setting off a train of events that led to war between the Greeks and Trojans, and eventually to Troy's destruction. In [[Founding of Rome|Rome's foundation myth]], Venus was the divine mother of the Trojan prince Aeneas, and thus a divine ancestor of the Roman people as a whole.

A separate cult to ''Venus Erycina'' as a fertility deity,<ref name=\"autogenerated72\"/> was established in 181 BC, in a traditionally plebeian district just outside [[pomerium|Rome's sacred boundary]], near the [[Colline Gate]].

The general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Sulla]] adopted ''Felix'' (\"Lucky\") as a surname, acknowledging his debt to heaven-sent good fortune and his particular debt to ''Venus Felix'', for his extraordinarily fortunate political and military career.<ref>Plutarch's original Greek translates this adopted surname, Felix, as Epaphroditus (Aphrodite's beloved); see Plutarch, Sulla 19.9.</ref> His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Pompey]] competed for Venus' support, dedicating (in 55 BC) a large temple to ''Venus Victrix'' as part of his lavishly appointed new [[Theatre of Pompey|theatre]], and celebrating his triumph of 54 BC with coins that showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.<ref name=\"Beard, 2007, pp. 22 - 23\">Beard, 2007, pp. 22 \u2013 23.</ref>\n\nPompey's erstwhile friend, ally, and later opponent [[Julius Caesar]] went still further. He claimed the favours of ''Venus Victrix'' in his military success and ''Venus Genetrix'' as a personal, divine ancestress \u2013 apparently a long-standing family tradition among the [[Julia (gens)|Julii]]. When Caesar was assassinated, his heir, [[Augustus]], adopted both claims as evidence of his inherent fitness for office, and divine approval of his rule.<ref>Orlin, in R\u00fcpke (ed), pp. 67 \u2013 69: \"At the battle of Pharsalus, Caesar also vowed a temple, in best republican fashion, to Venus Victrix, almost as if he were summoning Pompey\u2019s protectress to his side in the manner of an ''[[evocatio]]''. Three years after Pompey's defeat at the battle of Actium, Caesar dedicated his new Roman Forum, complete with a temple to his ancestor ''Venus Genetrix'', \"apparently in fulfillment of the vow\".

He finds the Corinthian style, slender, elegant, enriched with ornamental leaves and surmounted by [[volute]]s, appropriate to Venus' character and disposition.<ref>Immediately after these remarks, Vitruvius prescribes the best positioning for temples to Venus' two divine consorts, Vulcan and Mars. Vulcan's should be outside the city, to reduce the dangers of fire, which is his element; Mars' too should be outside the city, so that \"no armed frays may disturb the peace of the citizens, and that this divinity may, moreover, be ready to preserve them from their enemies and the perils of war.\" [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#7.1 Book 1, 7,1.]</ref> Vitruvius recommends the widest possible spacing between the temple columns, producing a light and airy space, and he offers Venus's temple in Caesar's forum as an example of how not to do it; the densely spaced, thickset columns darken the interior, hide the temple doors and crowd the walkways, so that matrons who wish to honour the goddess must enter her temple in single file, rather than arm-in arm.<ref>The widely spaced, open style preferred by Vitruvius is ''eustylos''.

At first, this statue was probably housed in the temple of ''[[Fortuna|Fortuna Virilis]]'', perhaps as divine reinforcement against the perceived moral and religious failings of its cult. In 114 BC ''Venus Verticordia'' was given her own temple.<ref>Carter, Jesse Benedict, \"The Cognomina of the Goddess 'Fortuna,'\" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 31, 1900, p. 66. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282639]</ref> She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and [[Mos maiorum|morality]] known to please the gods and benefit the State. During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men's baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia's help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For [[Ovid]], Venus's acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented a change of heart in the goddess herself.<ref>Langlands, p. 59, citing Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 4. 155 \u2013 62. Romans considered personal ethics or mentality to be functions of the heart.</ref>\n\n'''[[Vinalia#Vinalia Urbana|Vinalia urbana]]''' (April 23), a wine festival shared by Venus and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], king of the gods. Venus was patron of \"[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#profanum|profane]]\" wine, for everyday human use. Jupiter was patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine, and controlled the weather on which the autumn grape-harvest would depend. At this festival, men and women alike drank the new vintage of ordinary, non-sacral wine in honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with this gift. Upper-class women gathered at Venus's Capitoline temple, where a libation of the previous year's vintage, sacred to Jupiter, was poured into a nearby ditch.<ref>Olivier de Cazanove, \"Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin\", Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1988, Vol. 205, Issue 205-3, pp. 245\u2013265 [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1988_num_205_3_1888 persee]</ref> Common girls (''vulgares puellae'') and prostitutes gathered at Venus' temple just outside the Colline gate, where they offered her myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches and asked her for \"beauty and popular favour\", and to be made \"charming and witty\".<ref>Staples, p. 122, citing Ovid, ''Fasti'', 4,863 \u2013 872.</ref>\n\n'''[[Vinalia Rustica]]''' (August 19), originally a rustic [[Latium|Latin]] festival of wine, vegetable growth and fertility.

Varro insists that the day was sacred to Jupiter, whose control of the weather governed the ripening of the grapes; but the sacrificial victim, a female lamb (''agna''), may be evidence that it once belonged to Venus alone.<ref>For associations of kind between Roman deities and their sacrificial victims, see [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|Victima]].</ref><ref>Lipka, Michael, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'', Brill, 2009, p. 42; citing Varro, ''Lingua Latina'', 6. 16; Varro's explicit denial that the festival belongs to Venus implies his awareness of opposite scholarly and commonplace opinion. Lipka offers this apparent contradiction as an example of two Roman cults that offer \"complementary functional foci\".</ref>\n\nA festival of '''Venus Genetrix''' (September 26) was held under state auspices from 46 BC at [[Temple of Venus Genetrix|her Temple]] in the [[Forum of Caesar]], in fulfillment of a vow by [[Julius Caesar]], who claimed her personal favour as his divine patron, and ancestral goddess of the [[Julia (gens)|Julian clan]]. Caesar dedicated the temple during his unprecedented and extraordinarily lavish quadruple triumph. At the same time, he was [[pontifex maximus]] and Rome's senior magistrate; the festival is thought to mark the unprecedented promotion of a personal, family cult to one of the Roman state. Caesar's heir, Augustus, made much of these personal and family associations with Venus as an Imperial deity.<ref>Sulla may have set some form of precedent, but there is no evidence that he built her a Temple. Caesar's associations with Venus as both a personal and state goddess may also have been propagated in the Roman provinces.

At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]].

Her male counterparts in the Roman pantheon, [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], are active and fiery. Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue.<ref>Staples, Ariadne, ''From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion'', Routledge, 1998, pp. 12, 15\u201316, 24 \u2013 26, 149 \u2013 150: [[Varro]]'s theology identifies Venus with water as an aspect of the female principle.

To sustain life, water and fire must be balanced; excess of either one, or their mutual antagonism, are unproductive or destructive.</ref>\n\nProspective brides offered Venus a gift \"before the wedding\"; the nature of the gift, and its timing, are unknown.

Roman tradition made Venus the mother and protector of the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]], ancestor of the Roman people. Soon after, Rome's defeat of Carthage confirmed Venus's goodwill to Rome, her links to its mythical Trojan past, and her support of its political and military hegemony.<ref>Venus' links with Troy can be traced to the epic, mythic history of the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Judgement of Paris]], in which the Trojan prince [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose Aphrodite over [[Hera]] and [[Athena]], setting off a train of events that led to war between the Greeks and Trojans, and eventually to Troy's destruction. In [[Founding of Rome|Rome's foundation myth]], Venus was the divine mother of the Trojan prince Aeneas, and thus a divine ancestor of the Roman people as a whole.

A separate cult to ''Venus Erycina'' as a fertility deity,<ref name=\"autogenerated72\"/> was established in 181 BC, in a traditionally plebeian district just outside [[pomerium|Rome's sacred boundary]], near the [[Colline Gate]].

The general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Sulla]] adopted ''Felix'' (\"Lucky\") as a surname, acknowledging his debt to heaven-sent good fortune and his particular debt to ''Venus Felix'', for his extraordinarily fortunate political and military career.<ref>Plutarch's original Greek translates this adopted surname, Felix, as Epaphroditus (Aphrodite's beloved); see Plutarch, Sulla 19.9.</ref> His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Pompey]] competed for Venus' support, dedicating (in 55 BC) a large temple to ''Venus Victrix'' as part of his lavishly appointed new [[Theatre of Pompey|theatre]], and celebrating his triumph of 54 BC with coins that showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.<ref name=\"Beard, 2007, pp. 22 - 23\">Beard, 2007, pp. 22 \u2013 23.</ref>\n\nPompey's erstwhile friend, ally, and later opponent [[Julius Caesar]] went still further. He claimed the favours of ''Venus Victrix'' in his military success and ''Venus Genetrix'' as a personal, divine ancestress \u2013 apparently a long-standing family tradition among the [[Julia (gens)|Julii]]. When Caesar was assassinated, his heir, [[Augustus]], adopted both claims as evidence of his inherent fitness for office, and divine approval of his rule.<ref>Orlin, in R\u00fcpke (ed), pp. 67 \u2013 69: \"At the battle of Pharsalus, Caesar also vowed a temple, in best republican fashion, to Venus Victrix, almost as if he were summoning Pompey\u2019s protectress to his side in the manner of an ''[[evocatio]]''. Three years after Pompey's defeat at the battle of Actium, Caesar dedicated his new Roman Forum, complete with a temple to his ancestor ''Venus Genetrix'', \"apparently in fulfillment of the vow\".

He finds the Corinthian style, slender, elegant, enriched with ornamental leaves and surmounted by [[volute]]s, appropriate to Venus' character and disposition.<ref>Immediately after these remarks, Vitruvius prescribes the best positioning for temples to Venus' two divine consorts, Vulcan and Mars. Vulcan's should be outside the city, to reduce the dangers of fire, which is his element; Mars' too should be outside the city, so that \"no armed frays may disturb the peace of the citizens, and that this divinity may, moreover, be ready to preserve them from their enemies and the perils of war.\" [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#7.1 Book 1, 7,1.]</ref> Vitruvius recommends the widest possible spacing between the temple columns, producing a light and airy space, and he offers Venus's temple in Caesar's forum as an example of how not to do it; the densely spaced, thickset columns darken the interior, hide the temple doors and crowd the walkways, so that matrons who wish to honour the goddess must enter her temple in single file, rather than arm-in arm.<ref>The widely spaced, open style preferred by Vitruvius is ''eustylos''.

During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men's baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia's help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For [[Ovid]], Venus's acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented a change of heart in the goddess herself.<ref>Langlands, p. 59, citing Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 4. 155 \u2013 62.

Jupiter was patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine, and controlled the weather on which the autumn grape-harvest would depend. At this festival, men and women alike drank the new vintage of ordinary, non-sacral wine in honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with this gift. Upper-class women gathered at Venus's Capitoline temple, where a libation of the previous year's vintage, sacred to Jupiter, was poured into a nearby ditch.<ref>Olivier de Cazanove, \"Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin\", Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1988, Vol. 205, Issue 205-3, pp. 245\u2013265 [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1988_num_205_3_1888 persee]</ref> Common girls (''vulgares puellae'') and prostitutes gathered at Venus' temple just outside the Colline gate, where they offered her myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches and asked her for \"beauty and popular favour\", and to be made \"charming and witty\".<ref>Staples, p. 122, citing Ovid, ''Fasti'', 4,863 \u2013 872.</ref>\n\n'''[[Vinalia Rustica]]''' (August 19), originally a rustic [[Latium|Latin]] festival of wine, vegetable growth and fertility.

Caesar dedicated the temple during his unprecedented and extraordinarily lavish quadruple triumph. At the same time, he was [[pontifex maximus]] and Rome's senior magistrate; the festival is thought to mark the unprecedented promotion of a personal, family cult to one of the Roman state. Caesar's heir, Augustus, made much of these personal and family associations with Venus as an Imperial deity.<ref>Sulla may have set some form of precedent, but there is no evidence that he built her a Temple. Caesar's associations with Venus as both a personal and state goddess may also have been propagated in the Roman provinces.

Likewise, Roman folk-etymology transformed the ancient, obscure goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]] into \"Venus of the Myrtles, whom we now call Murcia\".<ref>Eden, pp. 457 \u2013 8, citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', Book 15, 119 \u2013 121. ''Murcia'' had a shrine at the [[Circus Maximus]].</ref>\n\n[[Myrtus|Myrtle]] was thought a particularly potent [[aphrodisiac]]. As goddess of love and sex, Venus played an essential role at Roman prenuptial rites and wedding nights, so myrtle and roses were used in bridal bouquets. Marriage itself was not a seduction but a lawful condition, under [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s authority; so myrtle was excluded from the [[bridal crown]]. Venus was also a patron of the ordinary, everyday wine drunk by most Roman men and women; the seductive powers of wine were well known. In the rites to [[Bona Dea]], a goddess of female chastity,<ref>\"Bona Dea\" means \"The Good Goddess\". She was also a \"Women's goddess\".</ref> Venus, myrtle and anything male were not only excluded, but unmentionable. The rites allowed women to drink the strongest, sacrificial wine, otherwise reserved for the Roman gods and Roman men; the women euphemistically referred to it as \"honey\". Under these special circumstances, they could get virtuously, religiously drunk on strong wine, safe from Venus' temptations. Outside of this context, ordinary wine (that is, Venus' wine) tinctured with myrtle oil was thought particularly suitable for women.<ref>Versnel, H.

spread of COVID 19 simply because COVID 19 has a lipid / OIL layer covering it which breaks in the presence of Soap.\nResearch has identified that COVID 19 which enters through nose / mouth attaches to Angiotensin \u2013 Converting Enzyme 2(ACE 2), which is found in plenty in interior of one\u2019s THROAT to enter the human body.\nHence by breaking / killing COVID 19 where it sets inside the first place in the human body is the EASIEST way to ensure it\u2019s elimination.\nSOLUTION:\nApart from washing one\u2019s hands with soap frequently, simple taking a TEASPOON of INTERNAL SOAP once every 3 hours will break the COVID 19  present therein, vastly or completely CUTTING the entry of COVID into the human body.\nBy INTERNAL SOAP, is meant a NON IONIC Surfactant that has been used in Pharmaceutical Formulations and Intra Venous Liquids for ages which is extremely SAFE.\nExamples include  Polyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil          ( Kolliphor RH 40).\nPolyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil  works as an INTERNAL SOAP  the same way normal soap works externally in breaking the lipid layer of COVID 19  and can provide an excellent solution in cleansing the ENTRY point of Nose or Mouth, thus preventing the entrance of COVID 19 in the first place.\nAll one needs to do is \na) Smear a little of Polyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil in one\u2019s NOSE and \nb) Take a teaspoon of Polyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil and KEEP it in one\u2019s mouth for atleast 3 minutes, then Gargle and finally spit or eat it as may match one\u2019s convenience.\nWhile conventional SOAP works effectively outside the body, Polyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil will most effectively in the ENTRANCE of the body preventing COVID 19 to multiply and cause harm. \nIn essence, if washing hands with SOAP keeps COVID 19 away, use of INTERNAL SOAP keeps COVID 19 TRIPLE AWAY.\nPolyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated castor oil is fortunately manufactured in millions of pounds and can be IMMEDIATELY MADE AVAILABLE
