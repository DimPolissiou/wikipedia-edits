At the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' the village had a population of around 120. The [[Normans]] built a wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] edifice known as [[Waytemore Castle]] (see below).\n\nOnly the [[baptismal font]] survives from the Norman Church of St Michael, which was rebuilt in the early 15th century and altered and restored in the 17th and 19th centuries. Its conspicuous [[bell tower|belfry]] and [[spire]] were built in 1812.\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford 3.JPG|thumb|left|240px|St Michael's Church]]\nDespite outbreaks of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, the town continued to grow, reaching a population of about 1,200.\n\nThe [[Stort Navigation|River Stort]] is named after the town, and not the town after the river. When [[cartographer]]s visited the town in the 16th century, they reasoned that the town must have been named after the ford over the river and assumed the river was called the Stort.<ref name=\"Origin of name of river Stort\">{{cite web |title=Bishop's Stortford & Thorley: A History and Guide |url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide11/stort-navigation/ |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1769, the River Stort was made navigable, and the town became a stop on the [[mail coach]] road between [[Cambridge]] and London.\n\nBy 1801, Bishop's Stortford was a [[market town]], and a [[corn exchange]] had been established, while the main industry was [[malting]]. In 1842 the railway came to Bishop's Stortford. Another Victorian advance was the opening of a hospital in 1895.\n\nIn 1901 the population exceeded 7,000. The 1901 house known as Carfield Castle was used as an officers' [[billet]] in [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fit for a princess|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2630350/Fit-princess-Seven-bedroom-castle-turrets-romantic-gardens-2m-Prince-Charming-not-included.html |newspaper=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Bishop's Stortford was the evacuation centre for many Britons, including [[Clapton Girls Technology College]]. By 1951, Bishop's Stortford's population had reached 13,000, and growth as a commuter town continued through the second half of the 20th century. The [[M11 motorway]], [[Stansted Airport]], and rail links to London and Cambridge contributed to its rise in population to almost 38,000 at the time of the 2011 census.<ref name=ONS/>\n\nOf the six suburbs of [[Thorley, Hertfordshire|Thorley]], Thorley Park, Havers, Bishop's Park, St Michael's Mead and Hockerill, the last is a separate ecclesiastical parish east of the River Stort, centred around the old coaching inns, [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] in Stansted Road and the [[Bishop's Stortford railway station|railway station]].

He was [[transported to Australia]] as a convict.\n\nIn 1935 the parish church of [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] was destroyed by fire, and in 1937 a new church, to a spacious, light, and airy design by the architect [[Stephen Dykes Bower]], was erected in its place. This is a Grade II listed building and the tower dominates the eastern skyline of the town. The church contains a notable [[rose window]] designed by [[Hugh Ray Easton]] and a two-manual [[Henry Willis]] II organ. Concerts are also held there.\n\nOn 28 August 2007, two men and a teenager were shot dead at Plaw Hatch Close. Two women were seriously injured in the evening attack. Police presence was dramatically increased after the incident. However, crime rates in the town are well below the national average.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two men arrested over Bishop's Stortford shooting |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 September 2007 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-men-arrested-over-bishops-stortford-shooting-401088.html |location=London |first=Sam |last=Marsden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Girl, 3, survives fatal shooting |newspaper=BBC Online News |date=29 August 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6968619.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Castle Mound===\n{{Main|Waytemore Castle}}\n[[File:Waytemore Castle, Bishop' s Stortford - geograph.org.uk - 1764727.jpg|thumb|350px|Waytemore Castle, Bishop's Stortford]]\nWaytemore began as a [[motte and bailey]] castle in the time of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. A rectangular great tower was added to the motte in the 12th century. It was improved in the 13th century under [[John of England|King John]] and a licence for [[crenellation]] was granted in the mid-14th century.

Jackson Square (a modern shopping complex) was rebuilt and an extension added. The Havers estate, on the edge of the town, is being redeveloped with new houses and flats. Bishop's Stortford is useful for a large number of Hertfordshire and Essex villages in its area, as most nearby towns are small.\n\n==Rhodes Arts Complex==\n[[File:North side Rhodes Arts Complex Museum Theatre Bishop's Stortford Hertfordshire England.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Rhodes Arts Complex]] theatre and museum]]\nThe [[Rhodes Arts Complex]] incorporates a theatre, cinema, dance studio and conference facilities.

The constituency covers many other settlements, including [[Hertford]].\n\nA controversial political issue for the town relates to the expansion of [[Stansted Airport]]. A protest group called [[Stop Stansted Expansion]] opposes growth at the airport and plans for a second runway.\n\nThe town has a Youth Council of students from the local schools, but the Town Council is said to be \"reviewing [its] operation in relation to its responsibilities.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortford.org/youth-council |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030820/http://www.bishopsstortford.org/youth-council |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Monarchist League]] and the [[Constitutional Monarchy Association]] operate from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monarchy.net/Contact.aspx |title=Constitutional Monarchy Association |website=Monarchy.net |accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011 the Conservative council of Bishop's Stortford voted 13 to 3 in favour of cancelling its twinned status with [[Friedberg in der Wetterau]] in Germany and [[Villiers-sur-Marne]] in France.

The town is also home to many people working in the tourist industry, including hotels, catering and airline staff, as it is the closest large town to Stansted Airport. In total, about 85 per cent work in the services sector (2001 census). Bishop's Stortford is served both by [[high street]] chain stores and long-established family shops. The main retail streets are South Street, Potter Street, North Street and Hockerill Street. There is a modern shopping complex called Jackson Square. Market days are Thursday and Saturday, which consist of a selection of stalls with a variety of goods including bags and luggage, flowers, cards and clothing.\n\nBishop's Stortford [[Chamber of Commerce]] is the town's largest business organisation. It actively champions local projects and interests at local, regional and government level. Business Stortford is an initiative set up to showcase the town's unique location and encourage companies from the UK, Europe and beyond to relocate or expand their operations in the area. It is targeting European businesses seeking a base in the UK, international companies wanting a well-connected location in Europe and UK firms looking for first-class air transport links to Europe. Business Stortford is backed by Bishop's Stortford Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership.\n\n==Local media==\nBishop's Stortford has a local newspaper, ''the Bishop's Stortford Independent'' based at 12 North Street, which has been the home of publishing in the town since 1861.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk/home/about-us |title=About Us |website=bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk |access-date=26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford Station.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]]]]\nBishop's Stortford owes its continued growth to developments in transport.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]] is on the [[West Anglia Main Line]], and was first opened in 1842.

When [[cartographer]]s visited the town in the 16th century, they reasoned that the town must have been named after the ford over the river and assumed the river was called the Stort.<ref name=\"Origin of name of river Stort\">{{cite web |title=Bishop's Stortford & Thorley: A History and Guide |url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide11/stort-navigation/ |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1769, the River Stort was made navigable, and the town became a stop on the [[mail coach]] road between [[Cambridge]] and London.\n\nBy 1801, Bishop's Stortford was a [[market town]], and a [[corn exchange]] had been established, while the main industry was [[malting]]. In 1842 the railway came to Bishop's Stortford. Another Victorian advance was the opening of a hospital in 1895.\n\nIn 1901 the population exceeded 7,000. The 1901 house known as Carfield Castle was used as an officers' [[billet]] in [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fit for a princess|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2630350/Fit-princess-Seven-bedroom-castle-turrets-romantic-gardens-2m-Prince-Charming-not-included.html |newspaper=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Bishop's Stortford was the evacuation centre for many Britons, including [[Clapton Girls Technology College]]. By 1951, Bishop's Stortford's population had reached 13,000, and growth as a commuter town continued through the second half of the 20th century. The [[M11 motorway]], [[Stansted Airport]], and rail links to London and Cambridge contributed to its rise in population to almost 38,000 at the time of the 2011 census.<ref name=ONS/>\n\nOf the six suburbs of [[Thorley, Hertfordshire|Thorley]], Thorley Park, Havers, Bishop's Park, St Michael's Mead and Hockerill, the last is a separate ecclesiastical parish east of the River Stort, centred around the old coaching inns, [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] in Stansted Road and the [[Bishop's Stortford railway station|railway station]]. Postwar development has enlarged the town's area further.\n\n===Incidents===\n[[File:CornExchange.jpg|300px|thumb|The Corn Exchange]]\nIn March and April 1825, a number of buildings in Bishop's Stortford were set alight, causing great alarm.

He was [[transported to Australia]] as a convict.\n\nIn 1935 the parish church of [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] was destroyed by fire, and in 1937 a new church, to a spacious, light, and airy design by the architect [[Stephen Dykes Bower]], was erected in its place. This is a Grade II listed building and the tower dominates the eastern skyline of the town. The church contains a notable [[rose window]] designed by [[Hugh Ray Easton]] and a two-manual [[Henry Willis]] II organ. Concerts are also held there.\n\nOn 28 August 2007, two men and a teenager were shot dead at Plaw Hatch Close. Two women were seriously injured in the evening attack. Police presence was dramatically increased after the incident. However, crime rates in the town are well below the national average.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two men arrested over Bishop's Stortford shooting |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 September 2007 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-men-arrested-over-bishops-stortford-shooting-401088.html |location=London |first=Sam |last=Marsden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Girl, 3, survives fatal shooting |newspaper=BBC Online News |date=29 August 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6968619.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Castle Mound===\n{{Main|Waytemore Castle}}\n[[File:Waytemore Castle, Bishop' s Stortford - geograph.org.uk - 1764727.jpg|thumb|350px|Waytemore Castle, Bishop's Stortford]]\nWaytemore began as a [[motte and bailey]] castle in the time of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. A rectangular great tower was added to the motte in the 12th century. It was improved in the 13th century under [[John of England|King John]] and a licence for [[crenellation]] was granted in the mid-14th century.

Jackson Square (a modern shopping complex) was rebuilt and an extension added. The Havers estate, on the edge of the town, is being redeveloped with new houses and flats. Bishop's Stortford is useful for a large number of Hertfordshire and Essex villages in its area, as most nearby towns are small.\n\n==Rhodes Arts Complex==\n[[File:North side Rhodes Arts Complex Museum Theatre Bishop's Stortford Hertfordshire England.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Rhodes Arts Complex]] theatre and museum]]\nThe [[Rhodes Arts Complex]] incorporates a theatre, cinema, dance studio and conference facilities.

The town is also home to many people working in the tourist industry, including hotels, catering and airline staff, as it is the closest large town to Stansted Airport. In total, about 85 per cent work in the services sector (2001 census). Bishop's Stortford is served both by [[high street]] chain stores and long-established family shops. The main retail streets are South Street, Potter Street, North Street and Hockerill Street. There is a modern shopping complex called Jackson Square. Market days are Thursday and Saturday, which consist of a selection of stalls with a variety of goods including bags and luggage, flowers, cards and clothing.\n\nBishop's Stortford [[Chamber of Commerce]] is the town's largest business organisation. It actively champions local projects and interests at local, regional and government level. Business Stortford is an initiative set up to showcase the town's unique location and encourage companies from the UK, Europe and beyond to relocate or expand their operations in the area. It is targeting European businesses seeking a base in the UK, international companies wanting a well-connected location in Europe and UK firms looking for first-class air transport links to Europe. Business Stortford is backed by Bishop's Stortford Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership.\n\n==Local media==\nBishop's Stortford has a local newspaper, ''the Bishop's Stortford Independent'' based at 12 North Street, which has been the home of publishing in the town since 1861.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk/home/about-us |title=About Us |website=bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk |access-date=26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford Station.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]]]]\nBishop's Stortford owes its continued growth to developments in transport.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]] is on the [[West Anglia Main Line]], and was first opened in 1842.

Bernhard also finished 4th overall and 2nd in class in the [[Spa 24 Hours]].  He finished on the podium at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours for the 3rd straight year, finishing in third in a [[Manthey Racing]] Porsche.\n\n===2005===\nBernhard joined [[Romain Dumas]] in the ALMS for 2005.  They scored four class wins, and Bernhard won  four poles, but finished second in the championship.  Dumas also finished 2nd in the GT2 class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], driving with [[J\u00f6rg Bergmeister]] and [[Patrick Long]].\n\n===2006===\nIn 2006, Bernhard moved to [[Penske Racing]] who owned and captained by legendary owner [[Roger Penske]] and the new [[Porsche RS Spyder]] in the LMP2 class of the ALMS, again partnering Dumas.  After a frustrating start to the season, Bernhard and Dumas took advantage of the [[Audi R10]]'s absence from the series to take the overall win at [[2006 American Le Mans at Mid-Ohio|Mid-Ohio]]. This was the first overall win for an LMP2 class car, and the first win for an under-class car since 2003. Bernhard also won the LMP2 class at [[Petit Le Mans]] (with [[Sascha Maassen]] and [[Emmanuel Collard]]), and took four class victories in total and finished 3rd in the championship. He also won the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] outright, partnering [[Lucas Luhr]], [[Marcel Tiemann]], and [[Mike Rockenfeller]].\n\n===2009===\nBernhard and Dumas moved to [[Joest Racing]], in which he ran the new [[Audi R15 TDI]]. Along with [[Alexandre Pr\u00e9mat]], the #3 car finished 17th in the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]].\n\n===2010===\nAlong with Dumas and Rockenfeller, Bernhard took the overall win in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. This was the first win for either driver and set records throughout and after the race, including breaking the {{24hLM|1971}} distance record of {{convert|5335.313|km|mi|abbr=on}}; the car (#9) ran 397 laps and {{convert|5410.713|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Bernhard's victory made him the eleventh driver to complete the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)#Triple Crown|triple crown of endurance racing]], with Bernhard also winning not only the 2003 24 Hours of Daytona but also the [[2008 12 Hours of Sebring]] with Penske (also with Dumas but also with Collard). Bernhard partnered [[Klaus Graf (racing driver)|Klaus Graf]] in the Muscle Milk Team CytoSport [[Porsche RS Spyder]] to second place at [[2010 American Le Mans Series powered by eStar|Road America]], the seventh round of the [[2010 American Le Mans Series season|2010]] ALMS season.\n\n==Race Achievements==\n[[File:Audi R15 TDi - Audi Sport Team Joest.jpg|thumb|right|Bernhard driving an [[Audi R15 TDI]] at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]].]]\n*[[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] LMP2 class champion: [[2007 American Le Mans Series season|2007]], [[2008 American Le Mans Series season|2008]]\n*[[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] GT class champion: [[2004 American Le Mans Series season|2004]]\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans]] GT class winner: [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|2002]]\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans]] Overall winner: [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans|2010]], [[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans|2017]]\n*[[12 Hours of Sebring]] GT class winner: [[2004 12 Hours of Sebring|2004]]\n*[[12 Hours of Sebring]] Overall winner: [[2008 12 Hours of Sebring|2008]]\n*[[Petit Le Mans]] LMP2 class winner: [[2006 Petit Le Mans|2006]]\n*[[Petit Le Mans]] GT class winner: [[2003 Petit Le Mans|2003]], [[2004 Petit Le Mans|2004]]\n*[[24 Hours of Daytona]] overall winner: [[2003 24 Hours of Daytona|2003]]\n*[[24 Hours of Daytona]] GT class winner: [[2002 24 Hours of Daytona|2002]], [[2003 24 Hours of Daytona|2003]]\n*[[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] winner: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011\n*[[Porsche Carrera Cup Germany]] champion: 2001\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

He was former [[Team Penske]] driver and currently a [[Porsche]] factory driver,<ref>http://www.timo-bernhard.de/news_detail.php?id=186{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but was seconded to Audi for selected events in 2009 and 2010. He has also raced for the [[CytoSport]] in the [[2010 American Le Mans Series season]] (ALMS) and is a winner of the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)#Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in endurance racing. On 29 June 2018, he became the first person in 35 years to break the all-time [[List of N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife lap times|N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife lap record]], set since [[Stefan Bellof|Stefan Bellof's]] in 1983 with a [[Porsche 956]], in a derestricted [[Porsche 919 Hybrid|Porsche 919 Evo]] with a time of 5:19.546.<ref>[https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/motorsports/porsche-919-hybrid-evo-record-nuerburgring-nordschleife-5-minutes-19-seconds-55-timo-bernhard-15752.html 5:19.55 minutes \u2013 Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo takes record on Porsche Newsroom]</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nBernhard was born in [[Homburg, Saarland]]. He debuted in karting in 1991. He finished 5th at the CIK/FIA Junior World Championship and was crowned German junior champion. The next two years, Bernhard was 6th and 3rd at the German Karting Championship. In 1998 he moved to formula cars as he joined [[Formula Ford]], finishing 6th in both the German series and the Eurocup in 1998. In his last year in open-wheelers, 1999, Bernhard finished 3rd in the German Formula Ford.\n\n==Sports cars==\nFor 2000, Bernhard drove in [[Porsche Supercup]] as a UPS Porsche Junior driver, finishing 3rd in the championship.  In 2001, he made his [[American Le Mans Series]] debut at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where he finished 2nd in the GT class with [[Randy Pobst]] and [[Christian Menzel]], driving for [[Alex Job Racing]].  He also made four other ALMS starts, and won the Porsche Carrera Cup championship.\n\n===2002===\nIn 2002 he began the season with a class win in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] for [[The Racer's Group]].  He then finished second overall at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] driving for [[Alzen Motorsport]].  The crowning achievement of the year was winning the GT class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[Kevin Buckler]] and [[Lucas Luhr]].  He also finished 3rd in the Carrera Cup, and won his first ALMS race (with [[J\u00f6rg Bergmeister]]) and finished 4th in the championship.\n\n===2003===\nBernhard began the season by winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] outright in a [[Porsche 911 GT3]]-RS, driving with Buckler, Michael Schrom, and Bergmeister.  Bernhard and Bergmeister won 3 ALMS races, including [[Petit Le Mans]], and finished second in the championship.  He also finished 3rd at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours.\n\n===2004===\nIn 2004, Bernhard again partnered with [[J\u00f6rg Bergmeister]] in the ALMS.  The duo took six wins from nine starts and won the GT class driver's championship.  Their successes included class wins at Sebring and Petit Le Mans, both time joined by [[Sascha Maassen]].  Bernhard also finished 4th overall and 2nd in class in the [[Spa 24 Hours]].  He finished on the podium at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours for the 3rd straight year, finishing in third in a [[Manthey Racing]] Porsche.\n\n===2005===\nBernhard joined [[Romain Dumas]] in the ALMS for 2005.  They scored four class wins, and Bernhard won  four poles, but finished second in the championship.  Dumas also finished 2nd in the GT2 class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], driving with [[J\u00f6rg Bergmeister]] and [[Patrick Long]].\n\n===2006===\nIn 2006, Bernhard moved to [[Penske Racing]] who owned and captained by legendary owner [[Roger Penske]] and the new [[Porsche RS Spyder]] in the LMP2 class of the ALMS, again partnering Dumas.  After a frustrating start to the season, Bernhard and Dumas took advantage of the [[Audi R10]]'s absence from the series to take the overall win at [[2006 American Le Mans at Mid-Ohio|Mid-Ohio]]. This was the first overall win for an LMP2 class car, and the first win for an under-class car since 2003. Bernhard also won the LMP2 class at [[Petit Le Mans]] (with [[Sascha Maassen]] and [[Emmanuel Collard]]), and took four class victories in total and finished 3rd in the championship. He also won the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] outright, partnering [[Lucas Luhr]], [[Marcel Tiemann]], and [[Mike Rockenfeller]].\n\n===2009===\nBernhard and Dumas moved to [[Joest Racing]], in which he ran the new [[Audi R15 TDI]]. Along with [[Alexandre Pr\u00e9mat]], the #3 car finished 17th in the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]].\n\n===2010===\nAlong with Dumas and Rockenfeller, Bernhard took the overall win in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. This was the first win for either driver and set records throughout and after the race, including breaking the {{24hLM|1971}} distance record of {{convert|5335.313|km|mi|abbr=on}}; the car (#9) ran 397 laps and {{convert|5410.713|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Bernhard's victory made him the eleventh driver to complete the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)#Triple Crown|triple crown of endurance racing]], with Bernhard also winning not only the 2003 24 Hours of Daytona but also the [[2008 12 Hours of Sebring]] with Penske (also with Dumas but also with Collard). Bernhard partnered [[Klaus Graf (racing driver)|Klaus Graf]] in the Muscle Milk Team CytoSport [[Porsche RS Spyder]] to second place at [[2010 American Le Mans Series powered by eStar|Road America]], the seventh round of the [[2010 American Le Mans Series season|2010]] ALMS season.\n\n==Race Achievements==\n[[File:Audi R15 TDi - Audi Sport Team Joest.jpg|thumb|right|Bernhard driving an [[Audi R15 TDI]] at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]].]]\n*[[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] LMP2 class champion: [[2007 American Le Mans Series season|2007]], [[2008 American Le Mans Series season|2008]]\n*[[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] GT class champion: [[2004 American Le Mans Series season|2004]]\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans]] GT class winner: [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|2002]]\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans]] Overall winner: [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans|2010]], [[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans|2017]]\n*[[12 Hours of Sebring]] GT class winner: [[2004 12 Hours of Sebring|2004]]\n*[[12 Hours of Sebring]] Overall winner: [[2008 12 Hours of Sebring|2008]]\n*[[Petit Le Mans]] LMP2 class winner: [[2006 Petit Le Mans|2006]]\n*[[Petit Le Mans]] GT class winner: [[2003 Petit Le Mans|2003]], [[2004 Petit Le Mans|2004]]\n*[[24 Hours of Daytona]] overall winner: [[2003 24 Hours of Daytona|2003]]\n*[[24 Hours of Daytona]] GT class winner: [[2002 24 Hours of Daytona|2002]], [[2003 24 Hours of Daytona|2003]]\n*[[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] winner: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011\n*[[Porsche Carrera Cup Germany]] champion: 2001\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!
