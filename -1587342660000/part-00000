{"title_page": "List of east\u2013west roads in Toronto", "text_new": "{{see also|List of north\u2013south roads in Toronto|List of diagonal roads in Toronto}}\n{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThe following is a list of the east&ndash;west [[Arterial road|arterial thoroughfares]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The city is organized in a grid pattern dating back to the plan laid out by [[Augustus Jones]] between 1793 and 1797. Most streets are aligned in the north\u2013south or east\u2013west direction, based on the shoreline of [[Lake Ontario]]. In other words, major north&ndash;south roads are generally perpendicular to the Lake Ontario shoreline and major east&ndash;west roads are generally parallel to the lake's shoreline. The Toronto road system is also influenced by its topography as some roads are aligned with the old [[Glacial Lake Iroquois|Lake Iroquois]] shoreline, or the [[Toronto ravine system|deep valleys]]. Minor streets with documented history or etymology are listed in a [[List of east\u2013west roads in Toronto#Other notable roads|separate section]].\n\nRoads are listed south to north.\n\n{{horizontal TOC|align=center|nonum=yes}}\n\n== Expressways ==\n\n=== Gardiner Expressway ===\n{{Infobox road small\n|province=ON\n|name=Gardiner Expressway\n|shield=[[File:Gardiner Shield.svg|100px]]\n|location={{jcon|Hwy|427}} &ndash; Carlaw Avenue<br /><small>(continues west as [[Queen Elizabeth Way]])</small>\n|length_km=\n|length_ref=\n|length_round=1\n}}\n{{main|Gardiner Expressway}}\n[[File:Gardiner Expressway Downtown Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|The Gardiner Expressway in downtown Toronto]]\nThe '''Frederick G. Gardiner Expressway''', known locally as \"'''the Gardiner'''\", is an [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] connecting downtown with the western suburbs. Running close to the shore of [[Lake Ontario]], it now extends from the junction of [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway 427]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) in the west to the foot of the [[Don Valley Parkway]] in the east, just past the mouth of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]]. East of [[Dufferin Street]], the roadway is elevated, running above Lake Shore Boulevard east of Bathurst Street. Elevated sections east of the Don River were demolished and integrated into Lake Shore Boulevard.\n\nThe highway is named for the first chair of the now-defunct [[Metropolitan Toronto]] Council, [[Fred Gardiner|Frederick G. Gardiner]]. The six-lane section east of the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] was built in segments from 1955 until 1964 by the Metropolitan Toronto government with provincial highway funds. The ten-lane section west of the Humber was formerly part of the QEW and is now wholly owned and operated by the [[municipal government of Toronto]].\n\nWhen the Gardiner was built, it passed through industrial lands, now mostly converted to residential lands. Extensive repairs became necessary in the early 1990s, and since then, the Gardiner has been the subject of several proposals to demolish it or move it underground as part of downtown waterfront revitalization efforts. One elevated section east of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] was demolished in 2001, and a study is underway to demolish that part of the elevated section east of Jarvis Street to the Don River.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Highway 401 ===\n{{main|Ontario Highway 401}}\n{{Infobox road small\n|province=ON\n|name=King's Highway 401\n|shield=\n|location=Renforth Road &ndash; [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]]<br /><small>(continues east and west across southern Ontario)</small>\n|length_km=\n|length_ref=\n|length_round=1\n}}\n'''King's Highway 401''', colloquially referred to as '''the four-oh-one''', opened between December 1947 and August 1956, and was known as the ''Toronto Bypass'' at that time. Although it has since been enveloped by suburban development, it still serves as the primary east&ndash;west through route in Toronto and the surrounding region. East of the Don Valley Parkway, it is also known as the ''Highway of Heroes'', in reference to the funeral processions travelling between [[CFB Trenton]] and the Ontario Coroners Office in Downtown Toronto. Highway 401 crosses the entirety of Toronto and physically divides the city in half. It was also formerly known as the ''Macdonald\u2013Cartier Freeway''.\n\nHighway 401 is the busiest freeway in North America.<ref name=\"tgcar\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/jul/11/cars-busiest-roads-i405-interactive|title=Carmageddon: the world's busiest roads|last=Allen|first=Paddy|date=July 11, 2011|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News & Media Ltd.|language=|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Ontario Highway 409 ===\n{{main|Ontario Highway 409}}\n\n'''Ontario Highway 409''' or '''Belfield Expressway''' opened in 1978 to provide access to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] from westbound Highway 401 at Islington.

Largely as a result of this process, the shoreline was filled several hundred metres south to Queens Quay.\n\nFront Street begins at Bathurst Street and crosses through [[downtown Toronto]] north of the rail viaduct.

Simcoe feared the impending invasion of the Americans following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], an event which would occur in [[War of 1812|1812]]. Dundas Street was to connect York with [[Detroit]], then a British settlement; it reached as far as London, Simcoe's proposed new capital.

East of [[Dufferin Street]], the roadway is elevated, running above Lake Shore Boulevard east of Bathurst Street. Elevated sections east of the Don River were demolished and integrated into Lake Shore Boulevard.\n\nThe highway is named for the first chair of the now-defunct [[Metropolitan Toronto]] Council, [[Fred Gardiner|Frederick G. Gardiner]]. The six-lane section east of the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] was built in segments from 1955 until 1964 by the Metropolitan Toronto government with provincial highway funds. The ten-lane section west of the Humber was formerly part of the QEW and is now wholly owned and operated by the [[municipal government of Toronto]].\n\nWhen the Gardiner was built, it passed through industrial lands, now mostly converted to residential lands. Extensive repairs became necessary in the early 1990s, and since then, the Gardiner has been the subject of several proposals to demolish it or move it underground as part of downtown waterfront revitalization efforts.

Simcoe feared the impending invasion of the Americans following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], an event which would occur in [[War of 1812|1812]]. Dundas Street was to connect York with [[Detroit]], then a British settlement; it reached as far as London, Simcoe's proposed new capital.

In 1695 the land now known as the Borough of Audubon was part of [[Newton Township, Camden County, New Jersey|Newton Township]]. By the early 1700s the areas first families were building their homesteads. Today, two of these original farmhouses remain in Audubon. The Low-Stokes-Nicholson house was built circa 1732 by John Low. Simon Breach built his home, known locally as \"The Mansion House\", in about 1740. A large addition was built by shipbuilder [[John H. Dialogue|John Dialogue]] in c. 1853.  Samuel Nicholson Rhodes, a local naturalist and author, owned this farm, which he named \"Cedarcroft\", from 1898\u20131912.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dvoc.org/History/Founders/Rhoads/Rhoads_SamuelNicholson.htm|title=Samuel Nicholson Rhoads|website=dvoc.org|access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref> It was Mrs. Rhodes who came up with the name for the town. When the Atlantic City Railroad arrived in the 1880s the local farms were subdivided into the smaller communities of Audubon, Cedarcroft and Orston. Residential development began when both Audubon and Orston had train stations built in the 1890s.\n\nOn March 13, 1905, through an act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]], Audubon was created as a borough from portions of [[Haddon Township, New Jersey|Haddon Township]]. It was named for [[John James Audubon]], the [[naturalist]].<ref>Hutchinson, Viola L.

In 1695 the land now known as the Borough of Audubon was part of [[Newton Township, Camden County, New Jersey|Newton Township]]. By the early 1700s the areas first families were building their homesteads. Today, two of these original farmhouses remain in Audubon. The Low-Stokes-Nicholson house was built circa 1732 by John Low. Simon Breach built his home, known locally as \"The Mansion House\", in about 1740. A large addition was built by shipbuilder [[John H. Dialogue|John Dialogue]] in c. 1853.  Samuel Nicholson Rhodes, a local naturalist and author, owned this farm, which he named \"Cedarcroft\", from 1898\u20131912.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dvoc.org/History/Founders/Rhoads/Rhoads_SamuelNicholson.htm|title=Samuel Nicholson Rhoads|website=dvoc.org|access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref> It was Mrs. Rhodes who came up with the name for the town. When the Atlantic City Railroad arrived in the 1880s the local farms were subdivided into the smaller communities of Audubon, Cedarcroft and Orston. Residential development began when both Audubon and Orston had train stations built in the 1890s.\n\nOn March 13, 1905, through an act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]], Audubon was created as a borough from portions of [[Haddon Township, New Jersey|Haddon Township]]. It was named for [[John James Audubon]], the [[naturalist]].<ref>Hutchinson, Viola L.
