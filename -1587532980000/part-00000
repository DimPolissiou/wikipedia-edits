The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from [[comparative psychology]]. It has also been strongly influenced by research in [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]];  the alternative name [[cognitive ethology]] is sometimes used.

Many writers, such as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]], have speculated about the presence or absence of the animal mind.<ref>Descartes, R. (1649), ''Passions of the Soul''</ref> These speculations led to many observations of animal behavior before modern science and testing were available. This ultimately resulted in the creation of multiple hypotheses about animal intelligence.\n\nOne of [[Aesop's Fables]] was ''[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]'', in which a crow drops pebbles into a vessel of water until he is able to drink. This was a relatively accurate reflection of the capability of [[Corvidae|corvids]] to understand water displacement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140326182039.htm|title=Crows understand water displacement at the level of a small child: Show causal understanding of a 5- to 7-year-old child|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> The Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] was the earliest to attest that said story reflects the behavior of real-life corvids.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sDwZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA525&dq=pliny+crow+urn+stones+water#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Natural History|last=Pliny the Elder|year=1855}}</ref>\n\n[[Aristotle]], in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], hypothesized a [[causal chain]] where an animal's sense organs transmitted information to an organ capable of making decisions, and then to a motor organ. Despite Aristotle's cardiocentrism (mistaken belief that cognition occurred in the heart), this approached some modern understandings of [[information processing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corcilius|first=Klaus|last2=Gregoric|first2=Pavel|date=2013-01-01|title=Aristotle's Model of Animal Motion|journal=Phronesis|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=52\u201397|doi=10.1163/15685284-12341242|issn=1568-5284|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0255e59ac62b7417f2203176e2d6ba64cc7d5c90}}</ref>\n\nEarly inferences were not necessarily precise or accurate. Nonetheless, interest in animal mental abilities, and comparisons to humans, increased with early [[myrmecology]], the study of ant behavior, as well as the classification of humans as primates beginning with [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]].\n\n===Morgan's Canon===\n{{main|Morgan's Canon}}\nCoined by 19th-century British psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], Morgan's Canon remains a fundamental precept of [[comparative psychology|comparative (animal) psychology]]. In its developed form, it states that:<ref>{{cite book|author=Morgan, C.L.|year=1903|title=An Introduction to Comparative Psychology|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoco00morguoft|edition=2|publisher=W. Scott, London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoco00morguoft/page/59 59]}}</ref>\n<blockquote>In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, Morgan believed that [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] approaches to animal behavior were fallacious, and that people should only consider behaviour as, for example, rational, purposive or affectionate, if there is no other explanation in terms of the behaviours of more primitive life-forms to which we do not attribute those faculties.\n\n=== From anecdote to laboratory ===\n{{See also|Comparative psychology}}\n\nSpeculation about animal intelligence gradually yielded to scientific study after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] placed humans and animals on a continuum, although Darwin's largely anecdotal approach to the topic would not pass scientific muster later on.<ref>Darwin, C. 1871, ''The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex''</ref> This method would be expanded by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[George Romanes|George J. Romanes]],<ref>Romanes, J. G. 1883, ''Animal Intelligence''</ref> who played a key role in the opposition to anti-Darwinism. In spite of this, Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched [[anthropomorphism]].<ref name=\"Dewsbury, D. 1978\">Dewsbury, D. (1978). ''Comparative Animal Behavior''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. New York, NY.</ref> Unsatisfied with the previous approach,  [[E. L. Thorndike]] brought animal behavior into the laboratory for objective scrutiny.  Thorndike's careful observations of the escape of cats, dogs, and chicks from puzzle boxes led him to conclude that what appears to the naive human observer to be intelligent behavior may be strictly attributable to simple associations.  According to Thorndike, using Morgan's Canon, the inference of animal reason, insight, or consciousness is unnecessary and misleading.<ref>Thorndike, E. L. 1911, ''Animal intelligence''.</ref>  At about the same time,  [[I. P. Pavlov]] began his seminal studies of conditioned reflexes in dogs.  Pavlov quickly abandoned attempts to infer canine mental processes; such attempts, he said, led only to disagreement and confusion. He was, however, willing to propose unseen physiological processes that might explain his observations.<ref>Pavlov, I.P. 1928, ''Lectures on conditioned reflexes''</ref>\n\n=== The behavioristic half-century ===\n\nThe work of Thorndike, Pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist [[John B. Watson]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.

During this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations; notably, around 1930 the differences between Thorndike's [[Operant conditioning|instrumental (or operant) conditioning]] and Pavlov's [[Classical conditioning|classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning]] were clarified, first by Miller and Kanorski, and then by [[B. F. Skinner]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = S. | last2 = Konorski | first2 = J. | year = 1928 | title = Sur une forme particuli\u00e8re des reflexes conditionels | url = | journal = Comptes Rendus des S\u00e9ances de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Biologie et de Ses Filiales | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 1155\u20131157 }}</ref><ref>Skinner, B. F. (1932) ''The Behavior of Organisms''</ref>  Many experiments on conditioning followed; they generated some complex theories,<ref>Hull, C. L. (1943) ''The Principles of Behavior''</ref> but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes.   Probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the [[radical behaviorism]] of Skinner. This view seeks to explain behavior, including \"private events\" like mental images, solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal.<ref>Skinner, B. F. ''About Behaviorism'' 1976</ref>\n\nDespite the predominantly behaviorist orientation of research before 1960, the rejection of mental processes in animals was not universal during those years. Influential exceptions included, for example, [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] and his insightful chimpanzees<ref>K\u00f6hler, W. (1917) ''The Mentality of Apes''</ref> and [[Edward Tolman]] whose proposed [[cognitive map]] was a significant contribution to subsequent cognitive research in both humans and animals.<ref>Tolman, E. C. (1948) ''Cognitive maps in rats and men'' Psychological Review, 55, 189-208</ref>\n\n=== The cognitive revolution ===\nBeginning around 1960, a \"[[Cognitive psychology|cognitive revolution]]\" in research on humans<ref>Niesser, U. (1967) ''Cognitive Psychology''</ref>  gradually spurred a similar transformation of research with animals.  Inference to processes not directly observable became acceptable and then commonplace. An important proponent of this shift in thinking was [[Donald O. Hebb]],  who argued that \"mind\" is simply a name for processes in the head that control complex behavior, and that it is both necessary and possible to infer those processes from behavior.<ref>p. 3,  Hebb, D. O. 1958 '' A Textbook of Psychology''</ref>  Animals came to be seen as  \"goal seeking agents that acquire, store, retrieve, and internally process information at many levels of cognitive complexity\".<ref name=\"Menzel\">p. 2, Menzel, R. & Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''</ref> The remainder of this article touches many areas of research that have appeared or greatly progressed since this seminal change in thinking, and many of the theoretical and empirical findings that have captured wide attention.\n\n== Methods ==\nThe acceleration of research on animal cognition in the last 50 years or so has led to a rapid expansion in the variety of species studied and methods employed.  The remarkable behavior of large-brained animals such as [[primates]] and [[cetacea]] have claimed special attention, but all sorts of mammals large and small (birds, fish, ants, bees, and others) have been brought into the laboratory or observed in carefully controlled field studies.  In the laboratory,  animals push levers, pull strings, dig for food, swim in water mazes, or respond to images on computer screens to get information for discrimination, [[attention]], [[memory]], and [[categorization]] experiments.<ref name=\"Wass\">p.8 ff, Wasserman & Zentall (eds) (2006)  ''Comparative Cognition''</ref>  Careful field studies explore memory for food caches, navigation by stars,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=James J.|last2=Smolka|first2=Jochen|last3=Nilsson|first3=Dan-Eric|last4=Dacke|first4=Marie|date=2018-01-31|title=How animals follow the stars|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=285|issue=1871|doi=10.1098/rspb.2017.2322|issn=0962-8452|pmc=5805938|pmid=29367394|page=20172322}}</ref> communication, tool use, identification of [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]], and many other matters. Studies often focus on the behavior of animals in their natural environments and discuss the putative function of the behavior for the propagation and survival of the species. These developments reflect an increased cross-fertilization from related fields such as [[ethology]] and [[behavioral ecology]].  Contributions from [[behavioral neuroscience]] are beginning to clarify the physiological substrate of some inferred mental process.\n\nSome researchers have made effective use of a [[Jean Piaget|Piagetian]] methodology, taking tasks which human children are known to master at different stages of development and investigating which of them can be performed by particular species. Others have been inspired by concerns for [[animal welfare]] and the management of domestic species; for example, [[Temple Grandin]] has harnessed her unique expertise in animal welfare and the ethical treatment of farm livestock to highlight underlying similarities between humans and other animals.<ref>Grandin, Temple (2009) ''Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best life for Animals'' (with Catherine Johnson)</ref> From a methodological point of view, one of the main risks in this sort of work is [[anthropomorphism]], the tendency to interpret an animal's behavior in terms of human [[feeling]]s, thoughts, and motivations.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/>\n\n== Research questions ==\n[[File:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The common chimpanzee can use tools. This individual is using a stick to get food.]]\nHuman and non-human animal cognition have much in common, and this is reflected in the research summarized below; most of the headings found here might also appear in an article on human cognition. Of course, research in the two also differs in important respects.  Notably, much research with humans either studies or involves language, and much research with animals is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings. Following are summaries of some of the major areas of research in animal cognition.\n\n=== Perception ===\nAnimals process information from eyes, ears, and other sensory organs to perceive the environment.  Perceptual processes have been studied in many species, with results that are often similar to those in humans. Equally interesting are those perceptual processes that differ from, or go beyond those found in humans, such as [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] in bats and dolphins, motion detection by [[Lateral line|skin receptors]] in fish, and extraordinary visual acuity, motion sensitivity and ability to see ultraviolet light in some [[Bird vision|birds]].<ref>Stebbins, W. C. & M. A. Berkley (1990) ''Comparative Perception, Vol. I, Basic Mechanisms; Vol. II, Complex Signals'' New York: Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Attention ===\nMuch of what is happening in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior. [[Attention]] refers to mental processes that select relevant information, inhibit irrelevant information, and switch among these as the situation demands.<ref>Smith, E. E., and Kosslyn, S. M. (2007) \"Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain\" Pearson Prentice Hall.</ref>   Often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears; such expectation makes for rapid selection of key stimuli when they become available. A large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non-human animals, and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds, mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans.<ref>Blough, D. S. (2006)  Reaction-time explorations of visual attention, perception, and decision in pigeons. In E. A. Wasserman & T. R. Zentall (Eds) ''Comparative Cognition: Experimental Explorations of Animal Intelligence''   pp. 89-105. New York: Oxford.</ref>\n\n==== Selective learning ====\nAnimals trained to discriminate between two stimuli, say black versus white, can be said to attend to the \"brightness dimension,\" but this says little about whether this dimension is selected in preference to others. More enlightenment comes from experiments that allow the animal to choose from several alternatives.  For example, several studies have shown that performance is better on, for example, a color discrimination (e.g. blue vs green) after the animal has learned another color discrimination (e.g. red vs orange) than it is after training on a different dimension such as an X shape versus and O shape. The reverse effect happens after training on forms. Thus, the earlier learning appears to affect which dimension, color or form, the animal will attend to.<ref>N. J. Mackintosh (1983) ''Conditioning and Associative Learning'' New York: Oxford</ref>\n\nOther experiments have shown that after animals have learned to respond to one aspect of the environment responsiveness to other aspects is suppressed.  In \"blocking\", for example, an animal is conditioned to respond to one stimulus (\"A\") by pairing that stimulus with reward or punishment.  After the animal responds consistently to A, a second stimulus (\"B\") accompanies A on additional training trials.  Later tests with the B stimulus alone elicit little response, suggesting that learning about B has been blocked by prior learning about A.<ref>Kamin, L. J. (1969) Predictability, surprise, attention, and conditioning.  In Campbell and Church (eds.) ''Punishment and Aversive Behavior'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts pp. 279-296</ref>   This result supports the hypothesis that stimuli are neglected if they fail to provide new information.  Thus, in the experiment just cited,  the animal failed to attend to B because B added no information to that supplied by A.  If true, this interpretation is an important insight into attentional processing, but this conclusion remains uncertain because blocking and several related phenomena can be explained by models of conditioning that do not invoke attention.<ref>Mackintosh, N. J. (1994) ''Animal Learning and Cognition'' San Diego: Academic Press</ref>\n\n==== Divided attention ====\nAttention is a limited resource and is not an all-or-nothing response:  the more attention devoted to one aspect of the environment, the less is available for others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Selective and divided attention in animals | url = | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 69 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201316 | doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2005.01.004| pmid = 15795066 }}</ref>  A number of experiments have studied this in animals.   In one experiment, a tone and a light are presented simultaneously to pigeons.  The pigeons gain a reward only by choosing the correct combination of the two stimuli (e.g. a high frequency tone together with a yellow light).  The birds perform well at this task, presumably by dividing attention between the two stimuli.  When only one of the stimuli varies and the other is presented at its rewarded value, discrimination improves on the variable stimulus but discrimination on the alternative stimulus worsens.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = D. S. | year = 1969 | title = Attention shifts in a maintained discrimination | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 166 | issue = 3901| pages = 125\u2013126 | doi=10.1126/science.166.3901.125| pmid = 5809588 |bibcode = 1969Sci...166..125B }}</ref>  These outcomes are consistent with the notion that attention is a limited resource that can be more or less focused among incoming stimuli.\n\n==== Visual search and attentional priming ====\nAs noted above, the function of attention is to select information that is of special use to the animal.  Visual search typically calls for this sort of selection, and search tasks have been used extensively in both humans and animals to determine the characteristics of attentional selection and the factors that control it.\n\nExperimental research on visual search in animals was initially prompted by field observations published by Luc Tinbergen (1960).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = L | year = 1960 | title = The natural control of insects in pine woods: I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds | url = | journal = Archives N\u00e9erlandaises de Zoologie | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 265\u2013343 | doi = 10.1163/036551660X00053 }}</ref> Tinbergen observed that birds are selective when foraging for insects. For example, he found that birds tended to catch the same type of insect repeatedly even though several types were available. Tinbergen suggested that this prey selection was caused by an attentional bias that improved detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others.  This \"attentional priming\" is commonly said to result from a pretrial activation of a mental representation of the attended object, which Tinbergen called a \"searching image\".\n\nTinbergen's field observations on priming have been supported by a number of experiments. For example, Pietrewicz and Kamil (1977, 1979)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pietrewicz | first1 = A. T. | last2 = Kamil | first2 = A. C. | year = 1977 | title = Visual Detection of Cryptic Prey by Blue Jays (''Cyanocitta cristata'') | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=biosciaviancog| journal = Science | volume = 195 | issue = 4278| pages = 580\u2013582 | doi=10.1126/science.195.4278.580| pmid = 17732294 |bibcode = 1977Sci...195..580P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pietrewicz | first1 = A.

The birds were rewarded for pecks at a picture showing a moth. Crucially, the probability with which a particular species of moth was detected was higher after repeated trials with that species  (e.g. A, A, A,...) than it was after a mixture of trials (e.g. A, B, B, A, B, A, A...).  These results suggest again that sequential encounters with an object can establish an attentional predisposition to see the object.\n\nAnother way to produce attentional priming in search is to provide an advance signal that is associated with the target.  For example, if a person hears a song sparrow he or she may be predisposed to detect a song sparrow in a shrub, or among other birds.  A number of experiments have reproduced this effect in animal subjects.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = P.

Zentall(eds) ''Comparative Cognition:  Experimental Exploration of Animal Intelligence'' New York: Oxford</ref>\n\nStill other experiments have explored nature of stimulus factors that affect the speed and accuracy of visual search.  For example, the time taken to find a single target increases as the number of items in the visual field increases.  This rise in RT is steep if the distracters are similar to the target, less steep if they are dissimilar, and may not occur if the distracters are very different from the target in form or color.<ref>Blough, D.

New York:Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Concepts and categories ===\nFundamental but difficult to define, the [[concept]] of \"concept\" was discussed for hundreds of years by philosophers before it became a focus of psychological study.  Concepts enable humans and animals to organize the world into functional groups; the groups may be composed of perceptually similar objects or events, diverse things that have a common function, relationships such as same versus different,  or relations among relations such as analogies.<ref name =Cats>E.

Press</ref>     Extensive discussions on these matters together with many references may be found in Shettleworth (2010)<ref name =\"Shettleworth\" />  Wasserman and Zentall (2006)<ref name=\"Wass\"/> and in Zentall ''et al.''

J., & Okanoya, K. (1995). Psychophysical methods for assessing perceptual categories. In G. M.Klump, R. J.Dooling, R. R.Fay, & W. C.Stebbins (Eds.),\" Methods in Comparative Psychoacoustics\" (pp. 307\u2013318). Basel, Switzerland: Birkh\u00e4user Verlag.</ref> Pigeons have been widely used, for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets; other birds and a number of other animals have been studied as well.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\" />\nIn a typical experiment, a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one, and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for non-category items.   Alternatively, a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures.  Many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before; successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus-response associations. A related method, sometimes used to study relational concepts,  is matching-to-sample. In this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives, one of which is the same as the first;  the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=Wass/><ref name =Zentall/>\n\n==== Perceptual categories ====\nPerceptual categorization is said to occur when a person or animal responds in a similar way to a range of stimuli that share common features.  For example, a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees Rex, Shep, or Trixie, which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid.  This sorting of instances into groups is crucial to survival.  Among other things, an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object (e.g. Rex bit me) to new instances of that category (dogs may bite).<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=Wass/><ref name = Zentall/>\n\n===== Natural categories =====\nMany animals readily classify objects by perceived differences in form or color.  For example, bees or pigeons quickly learn to choose any red object and reject any green object if red leads to reward and green does not.  Seemingly much more difficult is an animal's ability to categorize natural objects that vary a great deal in color and form even while of the same group.   In a classic study, [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] trained pigeons to respond to the presence or absence of human beings in photographs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Herrnstein | first1 = R.

Pigeons got food for pecking at pictures in set A but not for pecks at pictures in set B.  After they had learned this task fairly well, the outcome was reversed: items in set B led to food and items in set A did not. Then the outcome was reversed again, and then again,  and so on.   Vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals,  associating reward with a few pictures in one set caused the birds to respond to the other pictures in that set without further reward, as if they were thinking \"if these pictures in set A bring food, the others in set A must also bring food.\"  That is, the birds now categorized the pictures in each set as functionally equivalent. Several other procedures have yielded similar results.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name = Zentall/>\n\n==== Relational or abstract categories ====\nWhen tested in a simple stimulus matching-to-sample task (described above) many animals readily learn specific item combinations, such as \"touch red if the sample is red, touch green if the sample is green.\"  But this does not demonstrate that they distinguish between \"same\" and \"different\" as general concepts.  Better evidence is provided if, after training, an animal successfully makes a choice that matches a novel sample that it has never seen before.  Monkeys and chimpanzees do learn to do this, as do pigeons if they are given a great deal of practice with many different stimuli. However,  because the sample is presented first, successful matching might mean that the animal is simply choosing the most recently seen \"familiar\" item rather than the conceptually \"same\" item. A number of studies have attempted to distinguish these possibilities, with mixed results.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=Zentall/>\n\n==== Rule learning ====\nThe use of rules has sometimes been considered an ability restricted to humans, but a number of experiments have shown evidence of simple rule learning in primates<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = See | last2 = D'Amato | first2 = M. | last3 = Columbo | first3 = M. | year = 1988 | title = ''Representation of serial order in monkeys (''Cebus apella\") | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 11\u2013139 }}</ref> and also in other animals.  Much of the evidence has come from studies of sequence learning in which the \"rule\" consists of the order in which a series of events occurs.  Rule use is shown if the animal learns to discriminate different orders of events and transfers this discrimination to new events arranged in the same order.   For example,  Murphy ''et al.'' (2008)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Mondragon | first2 = E. | last3 = Murphy | first3 = V.

For one group ABA and BAB were rewarded, where A=\"bright light\" and B=\"dim light\".  Other stimulus triplets were not rewarded.  The rats learned the visual sequence, although both bright and dim lights were equally associated with reward.  More importantly, in a second experiment with auditory stimuli, rats responded correctly to sequences of novel stimuli that were arranged in the same order as those previously learned.  Similar sequence learning has been demonstrated in birds and other animals as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kundrey | first1 = S. M.

Tests of working memory evaluate memory for events that happened in the recent past, usually within the last few seconds or minutes.  Tests of reference memory evaluate memory for regularities such as \"pressing a lever brings food\" or \"children give me peanuts\".\n\n=====Habituation=====\n{{main|Habituation}}\nThis is one of the simplest tests for memory spanning a short time interval. The test compares an animal's response to a stimulus or event on one occasion to its response on a previous occasion.  If the second response differs consistently from the first, the animal must have remembered something about the first, unless some other factor such as motivation, sensory sensitivity, or the test stimulus has changed.\n\n=====Delayed response=====\nDelayed response tasks are often used to study short-term memory in animals.  Introduced by Hunter (1913), a typical delayed response task presents an animal with a stimulus such a colored light, and after a short time interval the animal chooses among alternatives that match the stimulus, or are related to the stimulus in some other way. In Hunter's studies, for example, a light appeared briefly in one of three goal boxes and then later the animal chose among the boxes, finding food behind the one that had been lighted.<ref>Hunter, W. S. (1913) \"The delayed reaction in animals and children\" Behavior Monographs, 2</ref> Most research has been done with some variation of the \"delayed matching-to-sample\" task. For example, in the initial study with this task, a pigeon was presented with a flickering or steady light. Then, a few seconds later, two pecking keys were illuminated, one with a steady light and one with a flickering light. The bird got food if it pecked the key that matched the original stimulus.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = D. S. | year = 1958 | title = Delayed matching in the pigeon | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 151\u2013160 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1959.2-151| pmid = 13801643 | pmc = 1403892}}</ref>\n\nA commonly-used variation of the matching-to-sample task requires the animal to use the initial stimulus to control a later choice between different stimuli. For example, if the initial stimulus is a black circle, the animal learns to choose \"red\" after the delay; if it is a black square, the correct choice is \"green\".  Ingenious variations of this method have been used to explore many aspects of memory, including forgetting due to interference and memory for multiple items.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/>\n\n=====Radial arm maze=====\n{{main|Radial arm maze}}\nThe [[radial arm maze]] is used to test memory for spatial location and to determine the mental processes by which location is determined.  In a radial maze test, an animal is placed on a small platform from which paths lead in various directions to goal boxes; the animal finds food in one or more goal boxes. Having found food in a box, the animal must return to the central platform.  The maze may be used to test both reference and working memory.  Suppose, for example, that over a number of sessions the same 4 arms of an 8-arm maze always lead to food. If in a later test session the animal goes to a box that has never been baited, this indicates a failure of reference memory.  On the other hand, if the animal goes to a box that it has already emptied during the same test session, this indicates a failure of working memory.  Various confounding factors, such as odor [[Sensory cue|cue]]s, are carefully controlled in such experiments.<ref>Shettleworth, S. J. (2010)  \"Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior\"  New York: Oxford</ref>\n\n=====Water maze=====\n{{main|Morris water navigation task}}\nThe [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]] is used to test an animal's memory for spatial location and to discover how an animal is able to determine locations. Typically the maze is a circular tank filled with water that has been made milky so that it is opaque. Located somewhere in the maze is a small platform placed just below the surface of the water. When placed in the tank, the animal swims around until it finds and climbs up on the platform. With practice, the animal finds the platform more and more quickly. Reference memory is assessed by removing the platform and observing the relative amount of time the animal spends swimming in the area where the platform had been located.  Visual and other cues in and around the tank may be varied to assess the animal's reliance on landmarks and the geometric relations among them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vorhees | first1 = C.

Sometimes such a task can be performed rather simply, for example by following a chemical trail. Typically, however, the animal must somehow acquire and use information about locations, directions, and distances. The following paragraphs outline some of the ways that animals do this.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=\"pigeon.psy.tufts.edu\">[http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/asc/toc.htm Animal Spatial Cognition:Comparative, Neural & Computational Approaches]</ref> \n*'''Beacons''' Animals often learn what their nest or other goal looks like, and if it is within sight they may simply move toward it; it is said to serve as a \"beacon\".\n*'''Landmarks''' When an animal is unable to see its goal, it may learn the appearance of nearby objects and use these landmarks as guides.  Researchers working with birds and bees have demonstrated this by moving prominent objects in the vicinity of nest sites, causing returning foragers to hunt for their nest in a new location.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/>\n*'''[[Dead reckoning]]''', also known as \"path integration,\" is the process of computing one's position by starting from a known location and keeping track of the distances and directions subsequently traveled. Classic experiments have shown that the [[desert ant]] keeps track of its position in this way as it wanders for many meters searching for food. Though it travels in a randomly twisted path, it heads straight home when it finds food.  However, if the ant is picked up and released some meters to the east, for example, it heads for a location displaced by the same amount to the east of its home nest.\n*'''Cognitive maps''' Some animals appear to construct a [[cognitive map]] of their surroundings, meaning that they acquire and use information that enables them to compute how far and in what direction to go to get from one location to another. Such a map-like representation is thought to be used, for example, when an animal goes directly from one food source to another even though its previous experience has involved only travel between each source and home.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/><ref>{{cite book |author = Lund, Nick |title = Animal cognition |publisher = Psychology Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-415-25298-0 |page = 4 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ti4cgStf6q8C&pg=PA4 }}</ref> Research in this area<ref name=\"pigeon.psy.tufts.edu\"/> has also explored such topics as the use of geometric properties of the environment by rats and pigeons, and the ability of [[rat]]s to represent a spatial pattern in either [[radial arm maze]]s or [[Morris water navigation task|water mazes]].

Thus, many animals are active during the day, others are active at night, still others near dawn and dusk. Though one might think that these \"circadian rhythms\" are controlled simply by the presence or absence of light, nearly every animal that has been studied has been shown to have a \"biological clock\" that yields cycles of activity even when the animal is in constant illumination or darkness.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\" /> Circadian rhythms are so automatic and fundamental to living things&nbsp;\u2013 they occur even in plants<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Webb |first1 = Alex A.R. |year = 2003 |title = The physiology of circadian rhythms in plants |journal = New Phytologist |volume = 160 |pages = 281\u2013303 |doi = 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00895.x |issue = 2 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dbee14e86d675761161788cb4d4ef89848747933 }}</ref> \u2013 that they are usually discussed separately from cognitive processes, and the reader is referred to the main article ([[Circadian rhythms]]) for further information.<ref name = \"ComparativeTime\">APA Handboook of Comparative Psychology, Vol 2 \"Perception, Learning and Cognition\",(2017), Call, J.(Ed),  Chapter 23,\"Timing in Animals\", APA Washington D.C.</ref>\n\n==== Interval timing ====\nSurvival often depends on an animal's ability to time intervals. For example, rufous hummingbirds feed on the nectar of flowers, and they often return to the same flower, but only after the flower has had enough time to replenish its supply of nectar. In one experiment hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time (e.g. twenty minutes) later. The birds learned to come back to the flowers at about the right time, learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Henderson |year = 2006 |title = Timing in free-living rufous hummingbirds, ''Selasphorus rufus'' |journal = Current Biology |volume = 16 |pages = 512\u2013515 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.054 |pmid = 16527747 |last2 = Hurly |first2 = TA |last3 = Bateson |first3 = M |last4 = Healy |first4 = SD |issue = 5 |display-authors=etal|doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe details of interval timing have been studied in a number of species.  One of the most common methods is the \"peak procedure\". In a typical experiment, a rat in an [[operant chamber]] presses a lever for food.  A light comes on, a lever-press brings a food pellet at a fixed later time, say 10 seconds, and then the light goes off. Timing is measured during occasional test trials on which no food is presented and the light stays on.  On these test trials, the rat presses the lever more and more until about 10 sec and then, when no food comes, gradually stops pressing.  The time at which the rat presses most on these test trials is taken to be its estimate of the payoff time.\n\nExperiments using the peak procedure and other methods have shown that animals can time short intervals quite exactly, can time more than one event at once, and can integrate time with spatial and other cues. Such tests have also been used for quantitative tests of theories of animal timing, such as Gibbon's [[Scalar expectancy|Scalar Expectancy Theory]] (\"SET\"),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gibbon | first1 = J | year = 1977 | title = Scalar expectancy theory and Weber's law in animal timing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 279\u2013325 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.279}}</ref> Killeen's Behavioral Theory of Timing,<ref>Killeen, P.

Discussions of tool use often involve a debate about what constitutes a \"tool\", and they often consider the relation of tool use to the animal's intelligence and brain size.\n\n====Mammals====\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = top\n| header = Series of photographs showing a bonobo fishing for termites.\n| width1 = 200| image1 = BonoboFishing01.jpeg\n| caption1 = A bonobo inserting a stick into a termite mound.\n| width2 = 200\n| image2 = BonoboFishing04.jpeg\n| caption2 = The bonobo starts \"fishing\" for the termites.\n| width3 = 200\n| image3 = BonoboFishing02.jpeg\n| caption3 = The bonobo withdraws the stick and begins eating the termites.\n| width4 = 200\n| image4 = BonoboFishing05.jpeg\n| caption4 = The bonobo eats the termites extracted with the tool.\n}}\nTool use has been reported many times in both wild and captive [[primate]]s, particularly the great apes. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.  Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the [[Fongoli]] [[savannah]] sharpen sticks to use as [[spear]]s when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070222-chimps-spears.html Chimps Use \"Spears\" to Hunt Mammals, Study Says] John Roach for National Geographic News (February 22, 2007) (accessed on June 12, 2010)</ref>  Other mammals that spontaneously use tools in the wild or in captivity include [[elephant]]s, [[bear]]s, [[cetacean]]s, [[sea otter]]s and [[mongoose]]s.\n\n====Birds====\nSeveral species of birds have been observed to use tools in the wild, including warblers, parrots, Egyptian vultures, brown-headed nuthatches, gulls and owls.  Some species, such as the [[woodpecker finch]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]], use particular tools as an essential part of their [[foraging]] behavior. However, these behaviors are often quite inflexible and cannot be applied effectively in new situations. A great many species of birds build nests with a wide range of complexities, but although nest-building behaviour fulfills the criteria of some definitions of \"tool-use\", this is not the case with other definitions.\n\nSeveral species of [[corvid]]s have been trained to use tools in controlled experiments. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the [[New Caledonian crow]]. One individual called \u201cBetty\u201d spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it at the bottom of the well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=G.R|title=Manufacture and use of hook-tools by New Caledonian crows|journal=Nature|volume=379|pages=249\u2013251|doi=10.1038/379249a0|year=1996|issue=6562|bibcode = 1996Natur.379..249H }}</ref><ref name=\"psycnet\">{{cite journal|last=Shettleworth|first=Sara J.|title=Do Animals Have Insight, and What Is Insight Anyway?|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=4|pages=217\u2013226|doi=10.1037/a0030674|pmid=23231629|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cep/66/4/217.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Fish====\n{{Main|Fish intelligence}}\nSeveral species of [[wrasses]] have been observed using rocks as anvils to crack [[bivalve]] (scallops, urchins and clams) shells.

The fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve, takes it into its mouth, swims several meters to a rock, which it then uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head.  This behaviour has also been recorded in a [[blackspot tuskfish]] (''Choerodon schoenleinii'') on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, yellowhead wrasse (''[[Halichoeres garnoti]]'') in Florida and a six-bar wrasse (''[[Thalassoma hardwicke]]'') in an aquarium setting.

Choosing \"half empty\" is supposed to indicate pessimism whereas choosing \"half full\" indicates optimism. To test this in animals, an individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus A, e.g. a 100&nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a positive event, e.g. highly desired food is delivered when a lever is pressed by the animal.  The same individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus B, e.g. a 900&nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a negative event, e.g. bland food is delivered when the animal presses a lever. The animal is then tested by being given an intermediate stimulus C, e.g. a 500&nbsp;Hz tone, and observing whether the animal presses the lever associated with the positive or negative reward.

In addition to the ape-language experiments mentioned above, there have also been more or less successful attempts to teach language or language-like behavior to some non-primate species, including [[parrots]] and [[great spotted woodpecker]]s. Arguing from his own results with the animal [[Nim Chimpsky]] and his analysis of others results, Herbert Terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences.<ref>Terrace, H., L.A. Petitto, R.J. Sanders, T.G. Bever(1979) Science 206 (4421): 891\u2013902</ref> Shortly thereafter [[Louis Herman]] published research on artificial language comprehension in the bottlenosed dolphin (Herman, Richards, & Wolz, 1984). Though this sort of research has been controversial, especially among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]], many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words, and that some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations, but there is little evidence that any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/>\n\n=== Insight ===\n{{See also|Reason}}\n[[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] is usually credited with introducing the concept of insight into experimental psychology.<ref name=\"psycnet\" />  Working with chimpanzees, K\u00f6hler came to dispute [[Edward Thorndike]]'s theory that animals must solve problems gradually, by trial and error. He said that Thorndike's animals could only use trial and error because the situation precluded other forms of problem solving. He provided chimps with a relatively unstructured situation, and he observed [[Eureka effect|sudden \"ah-ha!\"]] insightful changes of behavior, as, for example, when a chimp suddenly moved a box into position so that it could retrieve a banana.<ref>K\u00f6hler, W. \"Mentality of Apes,\" 1917.</ref> More recently, Asian elephants (''Elephas maximus'') were shown to exhibit similar insightful problem solving.

Some examples of this research follow.\n\nIn one study, rhesus monkeys viewed visual displays containing, for example, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items of different sorts. They were trained to respond to them in several ways involving numerical ordering, for example touching \"1\" first, \"2\" second and so on.  When tested with displays containing items they had never seen before, they continued to respond to them in order. The authors conclude that monkeys can represent the numerosities 1 to 9 at least on an ordinal scale.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/primatecognitionlab/References/BrannonTerrace2000.pdf Representation of the Numerosities 1-9 by Rhesus Macaques (Macaca) mulatto]</ref>\n\nAnts are able to use quantitative values and transmit this information.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reznikova | first1 = Zhanna | last2 = Ryabko | first2 = Boris | year = 2001 | title = A Study of Ants' Numerical Competence | url = | journal = [[Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence]] | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 111\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>Reznikova, Zh.

All bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static, non-moving dots, indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities.  The bears choosing correctly in congruent (number of dots coincided with area of the dots) and incongruent (number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots) trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen, not just a larger or smaller [[retina|retinal image]], which would indicate they are only judging size.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vonk | first1 = J. | last2 = Beran | first2 = M.J. | year = 2012 | title = Bears 'count' too: quantity estimation and comparison in black bears, Ursus americanus | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 231\u2013238 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.001| pmid = 22822244 | pmc = 3398692 }}</ref>\n\n[[Bottlenose dolphin]]s have shown the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots.

Based on this observation, ravens were tested for their understanding of \"seeing\" as a mental state.  In a first step, the birds protected their [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] when dominants were visible but not when they could only be heard from an adjacent room. In the next step, they had access to a small peephole which allowed them to see into the adjacent room.

This idea arose from research on children's [[crib talk]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976). Some such research has been done with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]).\n\nIn July, 2012 during the \"Consciousness in Human and Nonhuman Animals\" conference in Cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions:\n{{quotation|Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.<ref name=cdeclaration>{{cite web|title=The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Biological constraints ==\n\n[[File:AB003 Hedgehog from Rajasthan.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Hedgehogs instinctively roll into a ball when threatened, making them unsuitable for studies on aversion avoidance]]\n\nAnimals differ widely in many learning and cognitive tasks in ways that reflect their evolutionary history and their instinctual behaviors in natural environments. For example, dogs and rats easily learn to avoid an electric shock from the floor by moving to another part of the experimental chamber when they hear a tone preceding the shock; this is an appropriate response to a dangerous situation.  However, [[hedgehog]]s fail to learn this avoidance behavior. This might seem to show the hedgehog's inability to learn, but the hedgehog's instinctive reaction to a threat is to curl up into a ball, a response that interferes with possible escape behavior in this situation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[Instinctive drift]] is another factor that can influence the interpretation of cognitive research.  Instinctive drift is the tendency of an animal to revert to [[instinctive behavior]]s that can interfere with learned responses. The concept originated with [[Keller Breland|Keller]] and [[Marian Breland|Marian]] Breland when they taught a [[raccoon]] to put coins into a box. The raccoon drifted to its instinctive behavior of rubbing the coins with its paws, as it would do when foraging for food.<ref name=\"Breland and Breland, (1961)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Breland | first1 = K. | last2 = Breland | first2 = M. | year = 1961 | title = The misbehavior of organisms | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b2587316b6753979e4da4bae76c3933a9e95884| journal = American Psychologist | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 681\u2013684 | doi=10.1037/h0040090}}</ref>\n\nAnimal ability to process and respond to stimuli is correlated with brain size. Small-brain animals tend to show simple behaviors that are less dependent on learning than those of large-brained animals. Vertebrates, particularly mammals, have large brains and complex behavior that changes with experience. A formula called the [[encephalization quotient]] (EC) expresses a relationship between brain and body size; it was developed by H.J. Jerison in the late 1960s.<ref name=Dinosaur_Paleoneurology>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brett-Surman |editor1-first=Michael K. |editor2-first=Thomas R. |editor2-last=Holtz |editor3-first=James O. |editor3-last=Farlow |others=Illustrated by Bob Walters |title=The complete dinosaur |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind. |isbn=978-0-253-00849-7 |pages=191\u2013208 |edition=2nd|date=2012-06-27 }}</ref> When the encephalization quotient is plotted as a curve, an animal with an EC above the curve is expected to show more cognitive ability than the average animal of its size, whereas an animal with an EC below the curve is expected to have less. Various formulas been suggested, but the equation  '''''Ew(brain) = 0.12w(body)<sup>2/3</sup>'''''  has been found to fit data from a sample of mammals.<ref name=Moore>Moore, J. (1999): [http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/allometry/allometry.html Allometry], [[University of California]], San Diego</ref> The formula is suggestive at best, and should only be applied to non-mammals with extreme caution. For some of the other [[vertebrate]] classes, the power of 3/4 rather than 2/3 is sometimes used, and for many groups of [[invertebrates]], the formula may not give meaningful results.\n\n== Experimental evidence against animal cognition ==\nSeveral experiments cannot be readily reconciled with the belief that some animal species are intelligent, insightful, or possess a theory of mind.\n\n[[Jean-Henri Fabre]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fabre, J.

Many writers, such as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]], have speculated about the presence or absence of the animal mind.<ref>Descartes, R. (1649), ''Passions of the Soul''</ref> These speculations led to many observations of animal behavior before modern science and testing were available. This ultimately resulted in the creation of multiple hypotheses about animal intelligence. \n\nOne of [[Aesop's Fables]] was ''[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]'', in which a crow drops pebbles into a vessel of water until he is able to drink. This was a relatively accurate reflection of the capability of [[Corvidae|corvids]] to understand water displacement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140326182039.htm|title=Crows understand water displacement at the level of a small child: Show causal understanding of a 5- to 7-year-old child|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> The Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] was the earliest to attest that said story reflects the behavior of real-life corvids.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sDwZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA525&dq=pliny+crow+urn+stones+water#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Natural History|last=Pliny the Elder|year=1855}}</ref>\n\n[[Aristotle]], in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], hypothesized a [[causal chain]] where an animal's sense organs transmitted information to an organ capable of making decisions, and then to a motor organ. Despite Aristotle's cardiocentrism (mistaken belief that cognition occurred in the heart), this approached some modern understandings of [[information processing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corcilius|first=Klaus|last2=Gregoric|first2=Pavel|date=2013-01-01|title=Aristotle's Model of Animal Motion|journal=Phronesis|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=52\u201397|doi=10.1163/15685284-12341242|issn=1568-5284|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0255e59ac62b7417f2203176e2d6ba64cc7d5c90}}</ref>\n\nEarly inferences were not necessarily precise or accurate. Nonetheless, interest in animal mental abilities, and comparisons to humans, increased with early [[myrmecology]], the study of ant behavior, as well as the classification of humans as primates beginning with [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]].\n\n===Morgan's Canon===\n{{main|Morgan's Canon}}\nCoined by 19th-century British psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], Morgan's Canon remains a fundamental precept of [[comparative psychology|comparative (animal) psychology]]. In its developed form, it states that:<ref>{{cite book|author=Morgan, C.L.|year=1903|title=An Introduction to Comparative Psychology|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoco00morguoft|edition=2|publisher=W. Scott, London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoco00morguoft/page/59 59]}}</ref>\n<blockquote>In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, Morgan believed that [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] approaches to animal behavior were fallacious, and that people should only consider behaviour as, for example, rational, purposive or affectionate, if there is no other explanation in terms of the behaviours of more primitive life-forms to which we do not attribute those faculties.\n\n=== From anecdote to laboratory ===\n{{See also|Comparative psychology}}\n\nSpeculation about animal intelligence gradually yielded to scientific study after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] placed humans and animals on a continuum, although Darwin's largely anecdotal approach to the topic would not pass scientific muster later on.<ref>Darwin, C. 1871, ''The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex''</ref> This method would be expanded by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[George Romanes|George J. Romanes]],<ref>Romanes, J. G. 1883, ''Animal Intelligence''</ref> who played a key role in the opposition to anti-Darwinism. In spite of this, Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched [[anthropomorphism]].<ref name=\"Dewsbury, D. 1978\">Dewsbury, D. (1978). ''Comparative Animal Behavior''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. New York, NY.</ref> Unsatisfied with the previous approach,  [[E. L. Thorndike]] brought animal behavior into the laboratory for objective scrutiny.  Thorndike's careful observations of the escape of cats, dogs, and chicks from puzzle boxes led him to conclude that what appears to the naive human observer to be intelligent behavior may be strictly attributable to simple associations.  According to Thorndike, using Morgan's Canon, the inference of animal reason, insight, or consciousness is unnecessary and misleading.<ref>Thorndike, E. L. 1911, ''Animal intelligence''.</ref>  At about the same time,  [[I. P. Pavlov]] began his seminal studies of conditioned reflexes in dogs.  Pavlov quickly abandoned attempts to infer canine mental processes; such attempts, he said, led only to disagreement and confusion. He was, however, willing to propose unseen physiological processes that might explain his observations.<ref>Pavlov, I.P. 1928, ''Lectures on conditioned reflexes''</ref>\n\n=== The behavioristic half-century ===\n\nThe work of Thorndike, Pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist [[John B. Watson]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.

During this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations; notably, around 1930 the differences between Thorndike's [[Operant conditioning|instrumental (or operant) conditioning]] and Pavlov's [[Classical conditioning|classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning]] were clarified, first by Miller and Kanorski, and then by [[B. F.

F. (1932) ''The Behavior of Organisms''</ref>  Many experiments on conditioning followed; they generated some complex theories,<ref>Hull, C. L. (1943) ''The Principles of Behavior''</ref> but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes.   Probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the [[radical behaviorism]] of Skinner. This view seeks to explain behavior, including \"private events\" like mental images, solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal.<ref>Skinner, B. F. ''About Behaviorism'' 1976</ref>\n\nDespite the predominantly behaviorist orientation of research before 1960, the rejection of mental processes in animals was not universal during those years. Influential exceptions included, for example, [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] and his insightful chimpanzees<ref>K\u00f6hler, W. (1917) ''The Mentality of Apes''</ref> and [[Edward Tolman]] whose proposed [[cognitive map]] was a significant contribution to subsequent cognitive research in both humans and animals.<ref>Tolman, E. C. (1948) ''Cognitive maps in rats and men'' Psychological Review, 55, 189-208</ref>\n\n=== The cognitive revolution ===\nBeginning around 1960, a \"[[Cognitive psychology|cognitive revolution]]\" in research on humans<ref>Niesser, U. (1967) ''Cognitive Psychology''</ref>  gradually spurred a similar transformation of research with animals.  Inference to processes not directly observable became acceptable and then commonplace. An important proponent of this shift in thinking was [[Donald O. Hebb]],  who argued that \"mind\" is simply a name for processes in the head that control complex behavior, and that it is both necessary and possible to infer those processes from behavior.<ref>p. 3,  Hebb, D. O. 1958 '' A Textbook of Psychology''</ref>  Animals came to be seen as  \"goal seeking agents that acquire, store, retrieve, and internally process information at many levels of cognitive complexity\".<ref name=\"Menzel\">p. 2, Menzel, R. & Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''</ref> The remainder of this article touches many areas of research that have appeared or greatly progressed since this seminal change in thinking, and many of the theoretical and empirical findings that have captured wide attention.\n\n== Methods ==\nThe acceleration of research on animal cognition in the last 50 years or so has led to a rapid expansion in the variety of species studied and methods employed.  The remarkable behavior of large-brained animals such as [[primates]] and [[cetacea]] have claimed special attention, but all sorts of mammals large and small (birds, fish, ants, bees, and others) have been brought into the laboratory or observed in carefully controlled field studies.  In the laboratory,  animals push levers, pull strings, dig for food, swim in water mazes, or respond to images on computer screens to get information for discrimination, [[attention]], [[memory]], and [[categorization]] experiments.<ref name=\"Wass\">p.8 ff, Wasserman & Zentall (eds) (2006)  ''Comparative Cognition''</ref>  Careful field studies explore memory for food caches, navigation by stars,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=James J.|last2=Smolka|first2=Jochen|last3=Nilsson|first3=Dan-Eric|last4=Dacke|first4=Marie|date=2018-01-31|title=How animals follow the stars|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=285|issue=1871|doi=10.1098/rspb.2017.2322|issn=0962-8452|pmc=5805938|pmid=29367394|page=20172322}}</ref> communication, tool use, identification of [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]], and many other matters. Studies often focus on the behavior of animals in their natural environments and discuss the putative function of the behavior for the propagation and survival of the species. These developments reflect an increased cross-fertilization from related fields such as [[ethology]] and [[behavioral ecology]].  Contributions from [[behavioral neuroscience]] are beginning to clarify the physiological substrate of some inferred mental process.\n\nSome researchers have made effective use of a [[Jean Piaget|Piagetian]] methodology, taking tasks which human children are known to master at different stages of development and investigating which of them can be performed by particular species. Others have been inspired by concerns for [[animal welfare]] and the management of domestic species; for example, [[Temple Grandin]] has harnessed her unique expertise in animal welfare and the ethical treatment of farm livestock to highlight underlying similarities between humans and other animals.<ref>Grandin, Temple (2009) ''Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best life for Animals'' (with Catherine Johnson)</ref> From a methodological point of view, one of the main risks in this sort of work is [[anthropomorphism]], the tendency to interpret an animal's behavior in terms of human [[feeling]]s, thoughts, and motivations.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/>\n\n== Research questions ==\n[[File:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The common chimpanzee can use tools. This individual is using a stick to get food.]]\nHuman and non-human animal cognition have much in common, and this is reflected in the research summarized below; most of the headings found here might also appear in an article on human cognition. Of course, research in the two also differs in important respects.  Notably, much research with humans either studies or involves language, and much research with animals is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings. Following are summaries of some of the major areas of research in animal cognition.\n\n=== Perception ===\nAnimals process information from eyes, ears, and other sensory organs to perceive the environment.  Perceptual processes have been studied in many species, with results that are often similar to those in humans. Equally interesting are those perceptual processes that differ from, or go beyond those found in humans, such as [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] in bats and dolphins, motion detection by [[Lateral line|skin receptors]] in fish, and extraordinary visual acuity, motion sensitivity and ability to see ultraviolet light in some [[Bird vision|birds]].<ref>Stebbins, W. C. & M. A. Berkley (1990) ''Comparative Perception, Vol. I, Basic Mechanisms; Vol. II, Complex Signals'' New York: Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Attention ===\nMuch of what is happening in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior. [[Attention]] refers to mental processes that select relevant information, inhibit irrelevant information, and switch among these as the situation demands.<ref>Smith, E. E., and Kosslyn, S. M. (2007) \"Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain\" Pearson Prentice Hall.</ref>   Often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears; such expectation makes for rapid selection of key stimuli when they become available. A large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non-human animals, and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds, mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans.<ref>Blough, D. S. (2006)  Reaction-time explorations of visual attention, perception, and decision in pigeons. In E. A. Wasserman & T. R. Zentall (Eds) ''Comparative Cognition: Experimental Explorations of Animal Intelligence''   pp. 89-105. New York: Oxford.</ref>\n\n==== Selective learning ====\nAnimals trained to discriminate between two stimuli, say black versus white, can be said to attend to the \"brightness dimension,\" but this says little about whether this dimension is selected in preference to others. More enlightenment comes from experiments that allow the animal to choose from several alternatives.  For example, several studies have shown that performance is better on, for example, a color discrimination (e.g. blue vs green) after the animal has learned another color discrimination (e.g. red vs orange) than it is after training on a different dimension such as an X shape versus and O shape. The reverse effect happens after training on forms. Thus, the earlier learning appears to affect which dimension, color or form, the animal will attend to.<ref>N. J. Mackintosh (1983) ''Conditioning and Associative Learning'' New York: Oxford</ref>\n\nOther experiments have shown that after animals have learned to respond to one aspect of the environment responsiveness to other aspects is suppressed.  In \"blocking\", for example, an animal is conditioned to respond to one stimulus (\"A\") by pairing that stimulus with reward or punishment.  After the animal responds consistently to A, a second stimulus (\"B\") accompanies A on additional training trials.  Later tests with the B stimulus alone elicit little response, suggesting that learning about B has been blocked by prior learning about A.<ref>Kamin, L. J. (1969) Predictability, surprise, attention, and conditioning.  In Campbell and Church (eds.) ''Punishment and Aversive Behavior'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts pp. 279-296</ref>   This result supports the hypothesis that stimuli are neglected if they fail to provide new information.  Thus, in the experiment just cited,  the animal failed to attend to B because B added no information to that supplied by A.  If true, this interpretation is an important insight into attentional processing, but this conclusion remains uncertain because blocking and several related phenomena can be explained by models of conditioning that do not invoke attention.<ref>Mackintosh, N. J. (1994) ''Animal Learning and Cognition'' San Diego: Academic Press</ref>\n\n==== Divided attention ====\nAttention is a limited resource and is not an all-or-nothing response:  the more attention devoted to one aspect of the environment, the less is available for others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Selective and divided attention in animals | url = | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 69 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201316 | doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2005.01.004| pmid = 15795066 }}</ref>  A number of experiments have studied this in animals.   In one experiment, a tone and a light are presented simultaneously to pigeons.  The pigeons gain a reward only by choosing the correct combination of the two stimuli (e.g. a high frequency tone together with a yellow light).  The birds perform well at this task, presumably by dividing attention between the two stimuli.  When only one of the stimuli varies and the other is presented at its rewarded value, discrimination improves on the variable stimulus but discrimination on the alternative stimulus worsens.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = D. S. | year = 1969 | title = Attention shifts in a maintained discrimination | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 166 | issue = 3901| pages = 125\u2013126 | doi=10.1126/science.166.3901.125| pmid = 5809588 |bibcode = 1969Sci...166..125B }}</ref>  These outcomes are consistent with the notion that attention is a limited resource that can be more or less focused among incoming stimuli.\n\n==== Visual search and attentional priming ====\nAs noted above, the function of attention is to select information that is of special use to the animal.  Visual search typically calls for this sort of selection, and search tasks have been used extensively in both humans and animals to determine the characteristics of attentional selection and the factors that control it.\n\nExperimental research on visual search in animals was initially prompted by field observations published by Luc Tinbergen (1960).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = L | year = 1960 | title = The natural control of insects in pine woods: I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds | url = | journal = Archives N\u00e9erlandaises de Zoologie | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 265\u2013343 | doi = 10.1163/036551660X00053 }}</ref> Tinbergen observed that birds are selective when foraging for insects. For example, he found that birds tended to catch the same type of insect repeatedly even though several types were available. Tinbergen suggested that this prey selection was caused by an attentional bias that improved detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others.  This \"attentional priming\" is commonly said to result from a pretrial activation of a mental representation of the attended object, which Tinbergen called a \"searching image\".\n\nTinbergen's field observations on priming have been supported by a number of experiments. For example, Pietrewicz and Kamil (1977, 1979)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pietrewicz | first1 = A. T. | last2 = Kamil | first2 = A.

The birds were rewarded for pecks at a picture showing a moth. Crucially, the probability with which a particular species of moth was detected was higher after repeated trials with that species  (e.g. A, A, A,...) than it was after a mixture of trials (e.g. A, B, B, A, B, A, A...).  These results suggest again that sequential encounters with an object can establish an attentional predisposition to see the object.\n\nAnother way to produce attentional priming in search is to provide an advance signal that is associated with the target.  For example, if a person hears a song sparrow he or she may be predisposed to detect a song sparrow in a shrub, or among other birds.  A number of experiments have reproduced this effect in animal subjects.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = P.

Zentall(eds) ''Comparative Cognition:  Experimental Exploration of Animal Intelligence'' New York: Oxford</ref>\n\nStill other experiments have explored nature of stimulus factors that affect the speed and accuracy of visual search.  For example, the time taken to find a single target increases as the number of items in the visual field increases.  This rise in RT is steep if the distracters are similar to the target, less steep if they are dissimilar, and may not occur if the distracters are very different from the target in form or color.<ref>Blough, D.

Concepts enable humans and animals to organize the world into functional groups; the groups may be composed of perceptually similar objects or events, diverse things that have a common function, relationships such as same versus different,  or relations among relations such as analogies.<ref name =Cats>E.

J., & Okanoya, K. (1995). Psychophysical methods for assessing perceptual categories. In G. M.Klump, R. J.Dooling, R. R.Fay, & W. C.Stebbins (Eds.),\" Methods in Comparative Psychoacoustics\" (pp. 307\u2013318). Basel, Switzerland: Birkh\u00e4user Verlag.</ref> Pigeons have been widely used, for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets; other birds and a number of other animals have been studied as well.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\" />\nIn a typical experiment, a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one, and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for non-category items.   Alternatively, a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures.  Many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before; successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus-response associations. A related method, sometimes used to study relational concepts,  is matching-to-sample. In this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives, one of which is the same as the first;  the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=Wass/><ref name =Zentall/>\n\n==== Perceptual categories ====\nPerceptual categorization is said to occur when a person or animal responds in a similar way to a range of stimuli that share common features.  For example, a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees Rex, Shep, or Trixie, which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid.  This sorting of instances into groups is crucial to survival.  Among other things, an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object (e.g. Rex bit me) to new instances of that category (dogs may bite).<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=Wass/><ref name = Zentall/>\n\n===== Natural categories =====\nMany animals readily classify objects by perceived differences in form or color.  For example, bees or pigeons quickly learn to choose any red object and reject any green object if red leads to reward and green does not.  Seemingly much more difficult is an animal's ability to categorize natural objects that vary a great deal in color and form even while belonging to the same group.   In a classic study, [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] trained pigeons to respond to the presence or absence of human beings in photographs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Herrnstein | first1 = R.

In follow-up studies, pigeons categorized other natural objects (e.g. trees) and after training they were able without reward to sort photos they had not seen before .<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Herrnstein | first1 = R.

Pigeons got food for pecking at pictures in set A but not for pecks at pictures in set B.  After they had learned this task fairly well, the outcome was reversed: items in set B led to food and items in set A did not. Then the outcome was reversed again, and then again,  and so on.   Vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals,  associating reward with a few pictures in one set caused the birds to respond to the other pictures in that set without further reward, as if they were thinking \"if these pictures in set A bring food, the others in set A must also bring food.\"  That is, the birds now categorized the pictures in each set as functionally equivalent. Several other procedures have yielded similar results.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name = Zentall/>\n\n==== Relational or abstract categories ====\nWhen tested in a simple stimulus matching-to-sample task (described above) many animals readily learn specific item combinations, such as \"touch red if the sample is red, touch green if the sample is green.\"  But this does not demonstrate that they distinguish between \"same\" and \"different\" as general concepts.  Better evidence is provided if, after training, an animal successfully makes a choice that matches a novel sample that it has never seen before.  Monkeys and chimpanzees do learn to do this, as do pigeons if they are given a great deal of practice with many different stimuli. However,  because the sample is presented first, successful matching might mean that the animal is simply choosing the most recently seen \"familiar\" item rather than the conceptually \"same\" item. A number of studies have attempted to distinguish these possibilities, with mixed results.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=Zentall/>\n\n==== Rule learning ====\nThe use of rules has sometimes been considered an ability restricted to humans, but a number of experiments have shown evidence of simple rule learning in primates<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = See | last2 = D'Amato | first2 = M. | last3 = Columbo | first3 = M. | year = 1988 | title = ''Representation of serial order in monkeys (''Cebus apella\") | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 11\u2013139 }}</ref> and also in other animals.  Much of the evidence has come from studies of sequence learning in which the \"rule\" consists of the order in which a series of events occurs.  Rule use is shown if the animal learns to discriminate different orders of events and transfers this discrimination to new events arranged in the same order.   For example,  Murphy ''et al.'' (2008)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Mondragon | first2 = E. | last3 = Murphy | first3 = V.

For one group ABA and BAB were rewarded, where A=\"bright light\" and B=\"dim light\".  Other stimulus triplets were not rewarded.  The rats learned the visual sequence, although both bright and dim lights were equally associated with reward.  More importantly, in a second experiment with auditory stimuli, rats responded correctly to sequences of novel stimuli that were arranged in the same order as those previously learned.  Similar sequence learning has been demonstrated in birds and other animals as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kundrey | first1 = S. M.

Tests of working memory evaluate memory for events that happened in the recent past, usually within the last few seconds or minutes.  Tests of reference memory evaluate memory for regularities such as \"pressing a lever brings food\" or \"children give me peanuts\".\n\n=====Habituation=====\n{{main|Habituation}}\nThis is one of the simplest tests for memory spanning a short time interval. The test compares an animal's response to a stimulus or event on one occasion to its response on a previous occasion.  If the second response differs consistently from the first, the animal must have remembered something about the first, unless some other factor such as motivation, sensory sensitivity, or the test stimulus has changed.\n\n=====Delayed response=====\nDelayed response tasks are often used to study short-term memory in animals.  Introduced by Hunter (1913), a typical delayed response task presents an animal with a stimulus such a colored light, and after a short time interval the animal chooses among alternatives that match the stimulus, or are related to the stimulus in some other way. In Hunter's studies, for example, a light appeared briefly in one of three goal boxes and then later the animal chose among the boxes, finding food behind the one that had been lighted.<ref>Hunter, W. S. (1913) \"The delayed reaction in animals and children\" Behavior Monographs, 2</ref> Most research has been done with some variation of the \"delayed matching-to-sample\" task. For example, in the initial study with this task, a pigeon was presented with a flickering or steady light. Then, a few seconds later, two pecking keys were illuminated, one with a steady light and one with a flickering light. The bird got food if it pecked the key that matched the original stimulus.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = D. S. | year = 1958 | title = Delayed matching in the pigeon | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 151\u2013160 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1959.2-151| pmid = 13801643 | pmc = 1403892}}</ref>\n\nA commonly-used variation of the matching-to-sample task requires the animal to use the initial stimulus to control a later choice between different stimuli. For example, if the initial stimulus is a black circle, the animal learns to choose \"red\" after the delay; if it is a black square, the correct choice is \"green\".  Ingenious variations of this method have been used to explore many aspects of memory, including forgetting due to interference and memory for multiple items.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/>\n\n=====Radial arm maze=====\n{{main|Radial arm maze}}\nThe [[radial arm maze]] is used to test memory for spatial location and to determine the mental processes by which location is determined.  In a radial maze test, an animal is placed on a small platform from which paths lead in various directions to goal boxes; the animal finds food in one or more goal boxes. Having found food in a box, the animal must return to the central platform.  The maze may be used to test both reference and working memory.  Suppose, for example, that over a number of sessions the same 4 arms of an 8-arm maze always lead to food. If in a later test session the animal goes to a box that has never been baited, this indicates a failure of reference memory.  On the other hand, if the animal goes to a box that it has already emptied during the same test session, this indicates a failure of working memory.  Various confounding factors, such as odor [[Sensory cue|cue]]s, are carefully controlled in such experiments.<ref>Shettleworth, S. J. (2010)  \"Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior\"  New York: Oxford</ref>\n\n=====Water maze=====\n{{main|Morris water navigation task}}\nThe [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]] is used to test an animal's memory for spatial location and to discover how an animal is able to determine locations. Typically the maze is a circular tank filled with water that has been made milky so that it is opaque. Located somewhere in the maze is a small platform placed just below the surface of the water. When placed in the tank, the animal swims around until it finds and climbs up on the platform. With practice, the animal finds the platform more and more quickly. Reference memory is assessed by removing the platform and observing the relative amount of time the animal spends swimming in the area where the platform had been located.  Visual and other cues in and around the tank may be varied to assess the animal's reliance on landmarks and the geometric relations among them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vorhees | first1 = C.

Sometimes such a task can be performed rather simply, for example by following a chemical trail. Typically, however, the animal must somehow acquire and use information about locations, directions, and distances. The following paragraphs outline some of the ways that animals do this.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/><ref name=\"pigeon.psy.tufts.edu\">[http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/asc/toc.htm Animal Spatial Cognition:Comparative, Neural & Computational Approaches]</ref> \n*'''Beacons''' Animals often learn what their nest or other goal looks like, and if it is within sight they may simply move toward it; it is said to serve as a \"beacon\".\n*'''Landmarks''' When an animal is unable to see its goal, it may learn the appearance of nearby objects and use these landmarks as guides.  Researchers working with birds and bees have demonstrated this by moving prominent objects in the vicinity of nest sites, causing returning foragers to hunt for their nest in a new location.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/>\n*'''[[Dead reckoning]]''', also known as \"path integration,\" is the process of computing one's position by starting from a known location and keeping track of the distances and directions subsequently traveled. Classic experiments have shown that the [[desert ant]] keeps track of its position in this way as it wanders for many meters searching for food. Though it travels in a randomly twisted path, it heads straight home when it finds food.  However, if the ant is picked up and released some meters to the east, for example, it heads for a location displaced by the same amount to the east of its home nest.\n*'''Cognitive maps''' Some animals appear to construct a [[cognitive map]] of their surroundings, meaning that they acquire and use information that enables them to compute how far and in what direction to go to get from one location to another. Such a map-like representation is thought to be used, for example, when an animal goes directly from one food source to another even though its previous experience has involved only travel between each source and home.<ref name=\"Shettleworth\"/><ref>{{cite book |author = Lund, Nick |title = Animal cognition |publisher = Psychology Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-415-25298-0 |page = 4 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ti4cgStf6q8C&pg=PA4 }}</ref> Research in this area<ref name=\"pigeon.psy.tufts.edu\"/> has also explored such topics as the use of geometric properties of the environment by rats and pigeons, and the ability of [[rat]]s to represent a spatial pattern in either [[radial arm maze]]s or [[Morris water navigation task|water mazes]].

Thus, many animals are active during the day, others are active at night, still others near dawn and dusk. Though one might think that these \"circadian rhythms\" are controlled simply by the presence or absence of light, nearly every animal that has been studied has been shown to have a \"biological clock\" that yields cycles of activity even when the animal is in constant illumination or darkness.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\" /> Circadian rhythms are so automatic and fundamental to living things&nbsp;\u2013 they occur even in plants<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Webb |first1 = Alex A.R. |year = 2003 |title = The physiology of circadian rhythms in plants |journal = New Phytologist |volume = 160 |pages = 281\u2013303 |doi = 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00895.x |issue = 2 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dbee14e86d675761161788cb4d4ef89848747933 }}</ref> \u2013 that they are usually discussed separately from cognitive processes, and the reader is referred to the main article ([[Circadian rhythms]]) for further information.<ref name = \"ComparativeTime\">APA Handboook of Comparative Psychology, Vol 2 \"Perception, Learning and Cognition\",(2017), Call, J.(Ed),  Chapter 23,\"Timing in Animals\", APA Washington D.C.</ref>\n\n==== Interval timing ====\nSurvival often depends on an animal's ability to time intervals. For example, rufous hummingbirds feed on the nectar of flowers, and they often return to the same flower, but only after the flower has had enough time to replenish its supply of nectar. In one experiment hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time (e.g. twenty minutes) later. The birds learned to come back to the flowers at about the right time, learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Henderson |year = 2006 |title = Timing in free-living rufous hummingbirds, ''Selasphorus rufus'' |journal = Current Biology |volume = 16 |pages = 512\u2013515 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.054 |pmid = 16527747 |last2 = Hurly |first2 = TA |last3 = Bateson |first3 = M |last4 = Healy |first4 = SD |issue = 5 |display-authors=etal|doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe details of interval timing have been studied in a number of species.  One of the most common methods is the \"peak procedure\". In a typical experiment, a rat in an [[operant chamber]] presses a lever for food.  A light comes on, a lever-press brings a food pellet at a fixed later time, say 10 seconds, and then the light goes off. Timing is measured during occasional test trials on which no food is presented and the light stays on.  On these test trials, the rat presses the lever more and more until about 10 sec and then, when no food comes, gradually stops pressing.  The time at which the rat presses most on these test trials is taken to be its estimate of the payoff time.\n\nExperiments using the peak procedure and other methods have shown that animals can time short intervals quite exactly, can time more than one event at once, and can integrate time with spatial and other cues. Such tests have also been used for quantitative tests of theories of animal timing, such as Gibbon's [[Scalar expectancy|Scalar Expectancy Theory]] (\"SET\"),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gibbon | first1 = J | year = 1977 | title = Scalar expectancy theory and Weber's law in animal timing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 279\u2013325 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.279}}</ref> Killeen's Behavioral Theory of Timing,<ref>Killeen, P.

Discussions of tool use often involve a debate about what constitutes a \"tool\", and they often consider the relation of tool use to the animal's intelligence and brain size.\n\n====Mammals====\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = top\n| header = Series of photographs showing a bonobo fishing for termites.\n| width1 = 200| image1 = BonoboFishing01.jpeg\n| caption1 = A bonobo inserting a stick into a termite mound.\n| width2 = 200\n| image2 = BonoboFishing04.jpeg\n| caption2 = The bonobo starts \"fishing\" for the termites.\n| width3 = 200\n| image3 = BonoboFishing02.jpeg\n| caption3 = The bonobo withdraws the stick and begins eating the termites.\n| width4 = 200\n| image4 = BonoboFishing05.jpeg\n| caption4 = The bonobo eats the termites extracted with the tool.\n}}\nTool use has been reported many times in both wild and captive [[primate]]s, particularly the great apes. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.  Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the [[Fongoli]] [[savannah]] sharpen sticks to use as [[spear]]s when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070222-chimps-spears.html Chimps Use \"Spears\" to Hunt Mammals, Study Says] John Roach for National Geographic News (February 22, 2007) (accessed on June 12, 2010)</ref>  Other mammals that spontaneously use tools in the wild or in captivity include [[elephant]]s, [[bear]]s, [[cetacean]]s, [[sea otter]]s and [[mongoose]]s.\n\n====Birds====\nSeveral species of birds have been observed to use tools in the wild, including warblers, parrots, Egyptian vultures, brown-headed nuthatches, gulls and owls.  Some species, such as the [[woodpecker finch]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]], use particular tools as an essential part of their [[foraging]] behavior. However, these behaviors are often quite inflexible and cannot be applied effectively in new situations. A great many species of birds build nests with a wide range of complexities, but although nest-building behaviour fulfills the criteria of some definitions of \"tool-use\", this is not the case with other definitions.\n\nSeveral species of [[corvid]]s have been trained to use tools in controlled experiments. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the [[New Caledonian crow]]. One individual called \u201cBetty\u201d spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it at the bottom of the well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=G.R|title=Manufacture and use of hook-tools by New Caledonian crows|journal=Nature|volume=379|pages=249\u2013251|doi=10.1038/379249a0|year=1996|issue=6562|bibcode = 1996Natur.379..249H }}</ref><ref name=\"psycnet\">{{cite journal|last=Shettleworth|first=Sara J.|title=Do Animals Have Insight, and What Is Insight Anyway?|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=4|pages=217\u2013226|doi=10.1037/a0030674|pmid=23231629|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cep/66/4/217.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Fish====\n{{Main|Fish intelligence}}\nSeveral species of [[wrasses]] have been observed using rocks as anvils to crack [[bivalve]] (scallops, urchins and clams) shells.

The fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve, takes it into its mouth, swims several meters to a rock, which it then uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head.  This behaviour has also been recorded in a [[blackspot tuskfish]] (''Choerodon schoenleinii'') on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, yellowhead wrasse (''[[Halichoeres garnoti]]'') in Florida and a six-bar wrasse (''[[Thalassoma hardwicke]]'') in an aquarium setting.

Choosing \"half empty\" is supposed to indicate pessimism whereas choosing \"half full\" indicates optimism. To test this in animals, an individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus A, e.g. a 100&nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a positive event, e.g. highly desired food is delivered when a lever is pressed by the animal.  The same individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus B, e.g. a 900&nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a negative event, e.g. bland food is delivered when the animal presses a lever. The animal is then tested by being given an intermediate stimulus C, e.g. a 500&nbsp;Hz tone, and observing whether the animal presses the lever associated with the positive or negative reward.

In addition to the ape-language experiments mentioned above, there have also been more or less successful attempts to teach language or language-like behavior to some non-primate species, including [[parrots]] and [[great spotted woodpecker]]s. Arguing from his own results with the animal [[Nim Chimpsky]] and his analysis of others results, Herbert Terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences.<ref>Terrace, H., L.A. Petitto, R.J. Sanders, T.G. Bever(1979) Science 206 (4421): 891\u2013902</ref> Shortly thereafter [[Louis Herman]] published research on artificial language comprehension in the bottlenosed dolphin (Herman, Richards, & Wolz, 1984). Though this sort of research has been controversial, especially among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]], many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words, and that some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations, but there is little evidence that any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences.<ref name = \"Shettleworth\"/>\n\n=== Insight ===\n{{See also|Reason}}\n[[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] is usually credited with introducing the concept of insight into experimental psychology.<ref name=\"psycnet\" />  Working with chimpanzees, K\u00f6hler came to dispute [[Edward Thorndike]]'s theory that animals must solve problems gradually, by trial and error. He said that Thorndike's animals could only use trial and error because the situation precluded other forms of problem solving. He provided chimps with a relatively unstructured situation, and he observed [[Eureka effect|sudden \"ah-ha!\"]] insightful changes of behavior, as, for example, when a chimp suddenly moved a box into position so that it could retrieve a banana.<ref>K\u00f6hler, W. \"Mentality of Apes,\" 1917.</ref> More recently, Asian elephants (''Elephas maximus'') were shown to exhibit similar insightful problem solving.

Some examples of this research follow.\n\nIn one study, rhesus monkeys viewed visual displays containing, for example, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items of different sorts. They were trained to respond to them in several ways involving numerical ordering, for example touching \"1\" first, \"2\" second and so on.  When tested with displays containing items they had never seen before, they continued to respond to them in order. The authors conclude that monkeys can represent the numerosities 1 to 9 at least on an ordinal scale.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/primatecognitionlab/References/BrannonTerrace2000.pdf Representation of the Numerosities 1-9 by Rhesus Macaques (Macaca) mulatto]</ref>\n\nAnts are able to use quantitative values and transmit this information.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reznikova | first1 = Zhanna | last2 = Ryabko | first2 = Boris | year = 2001 | title = A Study of Ants' Numerical Competence | url = | journal = [[Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence]] | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 111\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>Reznikova, Zh.

All bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static, non-moving dots, indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities.  The bears choosing correctly in congruent (number of dots coincided with area of the dots) and incongruent (number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots) trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen, not just a larger or smaller [[retina|retinal image]], which would indicate they are only judging size.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vonk | first1 = J. | last2 = Beran | first2 = M.J. | year = 2012 | title = Bears 'count' too: quantity estimation and comparison in black bears, Ursus americanus | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 231\u2013238 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.001| pmid = 22822244 | pmc = 3398692 }}</ref>\n\n[[Bottlenose dolphin]]s have shown the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots.

Ravens are members of the [[corvidae]] family, which is widely regarded as having high cognitive abilities. These birds have been observed to hide their food when dominant ravens are visible and audible at the same time. Based on this observation, ravens were tested for their understanding of \"seeing\" as a mental state.  In a first step, the birds protected their [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] when dominants were visible but not when they could only be heard from an adjacent room. In the next step, they had access to a small peephole which allowed them to see into the adjacent room.

This idea arose from research on children's [[crib talk]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976). Some such research has been done with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]).\n\nIn July, 2012 during the \"Consciousness in Human and Nonhuman Animals\" conference in Cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions:\n{{quotation|Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.<ref name=cdeclaration>{{cite web|title=The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Biological constraints ==\n\n[[File:AB003 Hedgehog from Rajasthan.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Hedgehogs instinctively roll into a ball when threatened, making them unsuitable for studies on aversion avoidance]]\n\nAnimals differ widely in many learning and cognitive tasks in ways that reflect their evolutionary history and their instinctual behaviors in natural environments. For example, dogs and rats easily learn to avoid an electric shock from the floor by moving to another part of the experimental chamber when they hear a tone preceding the shock; this is an appropriate response to a dangerous situation.  However, [[hedgehog]]s fail to learn this avoidance behavior. This might seem to show the hedgehog's inability to learn, but the hedgehog's instinctive reaction to a threat is to curl up into a ball, a response that interferes with possible escape behavior in this situation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[Instinctive drift]] is another factor that can influence the interpretation of cognitive research.  Instinctive drift is the tendency of an animal to revert to [[instinctive behavior]]s that can interfere with learned responses. The concept originated with [[Keller Breland|Keller]] and [[Marian Breland|Marian]] Breland when they taught a [[raccoon]] to put coins into a box. The raccoon drifted to its instinctive behavior of rubbing the coins with its paws, as it would do when foraging for food.<ref name=\"Breland and Breland, (1961)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Breland | first1 = K. | last2 = Breland | first2 = M. | year = 1961 | title = The misbehavior of organisms | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b2587316b6753979e4da4bae76c3933a9e95884| journal = American Psychologist | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 681\u2013684 | doi=10.1037/h0040090}}</ref>\n\nAnimal ability to process and respond to stimuli is correlated with brain size. Small-brain animals tend to show simple behaviors that are less dependent on learning than those of large-brained animals. Vertebrates, particularly mammals, have large brains and complex behavior that changes with experience. A formula called the [[encephalization quotient]] (EC) expresses a relationship between brain and body size; it was developed by H.J. Jerison in the late 1960s.<ref name=Dinosaur_Paleoneurology>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brett-Surman |editor1-first=Michael K. |editor2-first=Thomas R. |editor2-last=Holtz |editor3-first=James O. |editor3-last=Farlow |others=Illustrated by Bob Walters |title=The complete dinosaur |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind. |isbn=978-0-253-00849-7 |pages=191\u2013208 |edition=2nd|date=2012-06-27 }}</ref> When the encephalization quotient is plotted as a curve, an animal with an EC above the curve is expected to show more cognitive ability than the average animal of its size, whereas an animal with an EC below the curve is expected to have less. Various formulas been suggested, but the equation  '''''Ew(brain) = 0.12w(body)<sup>2/3</sup>'''''  has been found to fit data from a sample of mammals.<ref name=Moore>Moore, J. (1999): [http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/allometry/allometry.html Allometry], [[University of California]], San Diego</ref> The formula is suggestive at best, and should only be applied to non-mammals with extreme caution. For some of the other [[vertebrate]] classes, the power of 3/4 rather than 2/3 is sometimes used, and for many groups of [[invertebrates]], the formula may not give meaningful results.\n\n== Experimental evidence against animal cognition ==\nSeveral experiments cannot be readily reconciled with the belief that some animal species are intelligent, insightful, or possess a theory of mind.\n\n[[Jean-Henri Fabre]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fabre, J.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6]] was developed to permit launches into [[polar orbit]].\n\nMOL competed with the [[Vietnam War]] for funds, and was beset by budget cuts that caused the date of the first operational flight to be repeatedly postponed. A single test flight, [[OPS 0855]], was launched on 3 November 1966. The program was canceled in June 1969, after it was demonstrated that automated [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were more cost-effective.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Bernard Adolph Schriever.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]] ]]\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11\u201312}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}}\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[File:MOL patch from NRO.jpg|thumb|left|MOL patch]]\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase.

With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program \u2013 Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million in funding for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120\u2013122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft.

McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} In all, some $3,237,716 was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500, followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[General Electric]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1,653 million. The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, an human operated system was superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, this could be greatly reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71\u201379}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Rusk to Robert McNamar |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost.

This was followed by a corresponding MOL White Financial Procedures Agreement, which was approved by Flax in December and signed by [[Leonard Marks Jr.]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller)]]. This provided for a more regular channel, with funds going through the AFSC to its Space Systems Division (SSD) and thence to the MOL SPO.

The Gemini capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made set of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the inttion was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the [[David Clark Company]], [[International Latex Corporation]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=212\u2013219}} A competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=223\u2013230}}\n\nThe contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA).{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}} This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an  [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|astronaut maneuvering unit]] (AMU) was deeloped and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS). The design was completed by October 1968, and a full prototype with cover garments was delivered in March 1969. The cover garments were never completed owing to the cancellation of the MOL program in June.

Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, in training flights, and win sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions. Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems. There was a Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Training was conducted in a [[zero-G]] environment on a [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] [[reduced-gravity aircraft]]. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=54}}\n\nNASA had pioneered [[neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid]] to simulate the space environment. The pilots were given [[scuba diving]] training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in [[Key West, Florida]]. Training was then conducted on a a General Electric simulator on [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge|Buck Island]], near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].  Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at [[Howard Air Force Base]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. In July 1967, the pilots underwent training at the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]] in Washington, DC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Facilities==\n===Launch complex===\n{{main|Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6}}\nThe military director of the NRO, Brigadier General [[John L.

Moreover, the dog leg maneuver would reduce the {{convert|30000|lb|adj=on}} orbital payload by {{convert|2000|to|5000|lb|-2}}, reducing the equipment that could be carried or the duration of the mission or both.

The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from California, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] on 24 February, chaired by the influential Senator [[Clinton P.

The US insisted that the MOL was in line with the 17 October 1963 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution that the exploration and use of outer space should be used\nonly for the betterment of mankind. To allay Soviet fears that the MOL would carry nuclear weapons, the State Department suggested that Soviet officials be permitted to inspect it for them before launch, but Brown opposed this on security grounds.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=73}}\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]].

In November 1965, Flax arbitraily cut $20 million from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million in 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\n[[File:MOL computers.jpg|thumb|left|The MOL program used state-of-the-art computers for design and simulation]]\n\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne Day |date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2858/1 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology\">{{cite web |title= MOL Program Chronology |date=December 1967 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/97.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Contracts were signed in May 1967.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from August to December 1971.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]], replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.

A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|mi|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\" />\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74\u201375}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S.

Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970. This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million, but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million. The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget's recommendation to cancel the MOL and proceed with Hexagon instead.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=158\u2013162}}     \n\nOn 7 June, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM, and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6]] was developed to permit launches into [[polar orbit]].\n\nMOL competed with the [[Vietnam War]] for funds, and was beset by budget cuts that caused the date of the first operational flight to be repeatedly postponed. A single test flight, [[OPS 0855]], was launched on 3 November 1966. The program was canceled in June 1969, after it was demonstrated that automated [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were more cost-effective.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Bernard Adolph Schriever.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]] ]]\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11-12}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}}\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}\n\n[[File:MOL patch from NRO.jpg|thumb|left|MOL patch]]\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase. Dyna-Soar would be launched into orbit by a [[Titan III]] booster.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|p=353}}{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=311}}\n\nThe same 22 February memorandum tacit approval for the development of a space station. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program - Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million in funding for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120-122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft.

Bleymaier Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.]]\nOn 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=36}} About $6 million was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37-38}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43-44}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} In all, some $3,237,716 was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500, followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43-44}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[General Electric]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40-41}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1,653 million. The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, an human operated system was superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, this could be greatly reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71-79}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Rusk to Robert McNamar |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost. The [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William Raborn]] thought that it might.

This was followed by a corresponding MOL White Financial Procedures Agreement, which was approved by Flax in December and signed by [[Leonard Marks Jr.]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller)]]. This provided for a more regular channel, with funds going through the AFSC to its Space Systems Division (SSD) and thence to the MOL SPO.  Thus far no definition contracts had been let, except for the Titan III booster. On 30 September, Brown released $12 million in fiscal year 1965 funds and $50 million in fiscal year 1966 funds for the MOL definition phase activities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=85-88}}\n\n[[File:MOL mockup.jpg|thumb|right|MOL mockup.

The Gemini capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made set of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the inttion was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the [[David Clark Company]], [[International Latex Corporation]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=212-219}} A competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=223-230}}\n\nThe contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA).{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230-233}} This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an  [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|astronaut maneuvering unit]] (AMU) was deeloped and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS). The design was completed by October 1968, and a full prototype with cover garments was delivered in March 1969. The cover garments were never completed owing to the cancellation of the MOL program in June. The protortype IMLSS was ultimately delivered to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230-233}}  \n==Astronauts==\n\n=== Selection ===\n{{see also|NASA Astronaut Group 7}}\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P.

Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, in training flights, and win sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions. Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems. There was a Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Training was conducted in a [[zero-G]] environment on a [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] [[reduced-gravity aircraft]]. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=54}}\n\nNASA had pioneered [[neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid]] to simulate the space environment. The pilots were given [[scuba diving]] training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in [[Key West, Florida]]. Training was then conducted on a a General Electric simulator on [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge|Buck Island]], near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].  Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at [[Howard Air Force Base]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]].

The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from California, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians.

In November 1965, Flax arbitraily cut $20 million from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million in 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\n[[File:MOL computers.jpg|thumb|left|The MOL program used state-of-the-art computers for design and simulation]]\n\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne Day |date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2858/1 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology\">{{cite web |title= MOL Program Chronology |date=December 1967 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/97.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Contracts were signed in May 1967.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from August to December 1971.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=150-151}}\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]], replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.

A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|mi|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\" />\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74-75}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148-149}}\n\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that \"receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities.\"{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=157}} Stewart briefed the new [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[David Packard]], on the MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970. This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156-157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million, but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million. The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget's recommendation to cancel the MOL and proceed with Hexagon instead.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=158-162}}     \n\nOn 7 June, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM, and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts.

The Shiga toxin causes inflammatory responses in target cells of the gut, leaving behind lesions which result in the bloody diarrhea that is a symptom of a [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|Shiga toxin-producing ''E. coli'']] (STEC) infection. This toxin further causes premature destruction of the red blood cells, which then clog the body's filtering system, the kidneys, in some rare cases (usually in children and the elderly) causing [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), which may lead to kidney failure and even death. Signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome include decreased frequency of urination, lethargy, and paleness of cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. In 25% of HUS patients, complications of nervous system occur, which in turn causes [[stroke]]s.  In addition, this strain causes the buildup of fluid (since the kidneys do not work), leading to [[edema]] around the lungs and legs and arms.  This increase in fluid buildup especially around the lungs impedes the functioning of the heart, causing an increase in blood pressure.<ref>\"''E. coli'' Food Poisoning.\" About. N.p., n.d.

The Shiga toxin causes inflammatory responses in target cells of the gut, leaving behind lesions which result in the bloody diarrhea that is a symptom of a [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|Shiga toxin-producing ''E. coli'']] (STEC) infection. This toxin further causes premature destruction of the red blood cells, which then clog the body's filtering system, the kidneys, in some rare cases (usually in children and the elderly) causing [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), which may lead to kidney failure and even death. Signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome include decreased frequency of urination, lethargy, and paleness of cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. In 25% of HUS patients, complications of nervous system occur, which in turn causes [[stroke]]s.  In addition, this strain causes the buildup of fluid (since the kidneys do not work), leading to [[edema]] around the lungs and legs and arms.

In the [[Book of Genesis]], Noah releases a raven from the ark after the great flood to test whether the waters have receded (Gen. 8:6-7). According to the Law of Moses, ravens are forbidden for food (Leviticus 11:15; Deuteronomy 14:14), a fact that may have colored the perception of ravens in later sources. In the [[Book of Judges]], one of Kings of the [[Midian]]ites defeated by [[Gideon]] is called \"[[Orev]]\" (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1) which means \"Raven\". In the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] 17:4-6, God commands the ravens to feed the prophet [[Elijah]]. [[King Solomon]] is described as having hair as black as a raven in the [[Song of Songs]] 5:11. Ravens are an example of God's gracious provision for all his creatures in Psalm 147:9 and Job 38:41. (In the [[New Testament]] as well, ravens are used by [[Jesus]] as an illustration of God's provision in [[Book of Luke|Luke]] 12:24.)\n\n[[Philo of Alexandria]] (first century AD), who interpreted the Bible allegorically, stated that Noah's raven was a symbol of vice, whereas the dove was a symbol of virtue (Questions and Answers on Genesis 2:38).\n\nIn the [[Talmud]], the raven is described as having been only one of three beings on [[Noah's Ark]] that copulated during the flood and so was punished.<ref name=Sanhedrin>Sanhedrin, 108b</ref> The Rabbis believed that the male raven was forced to ejaculate his seed into the female raven's mouth as a means of reproduction.<ref>b. Sanhedrin 108b. According to the Icelandic ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]''\u2014a story similar to Noah and the Ark -- [[Hrafna-Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arson]] used ravens to guide his ship from the Faroe Islands to Iceland.</ref>\n\n[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] (chapter 25) explains that the reason the raven Noah released from the ark did not return to him was that the raven was feeding on the corpses of those who drowned in the flood.<ref>This tradition is also preserved in the Byzantine composition ''Palaea Historica''. See David Flusser, \"''Palaea Historica'' An Unknown Source of Biblical Legends,\" ''Scripta Hieroslymitana'' 22 (1971): 48-79.</ref>\n\n===Late antiquity and Christian Middle Ages===\n[[Image:LSB.png|thumb|The ravens on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]] recall the story of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]]'s ravens.]]\n\nThe name of the important Frankish King [[Guntram]] means \"War Raven\".\n\nAccording to the legend of the fourth-century Iberian Christian [[martyr]] Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]], after St. Vincent was executed, ravens protected his body from being devoured by wild animals, until his followers could recover the body. His body was taken to what is now known as [[Cape St. Vincent]] in southern Portugal. A shrine was erected over his grave, which continued to be guarded by flocks of ravens. The Arab [[geographer]] [[Al-Idrisi]] noted this constant guard by ravens, for which the place was named by him \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628 \"Kan\u012bsah al-Ghur\u0101b\" (Church of the Raven). King [[Afonso Henriques]] (1139\u20131185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to [[Lisbon]], still accompanied by the ravens. This transfer of the relics is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]].\n\nA raven is also said to have protected [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]] by taking away a loaf of bread poisoned by jealous monks after he blessed it.\n\nIn the legends about the German Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], depicting him as [[King asleep in mountain|sleeping]]  along with his knights in a cave in the [[Kyffh\u00e4user]] mountain in [[Thuringia]] or the [[Untersberg]] in Bavaria, it is told that when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness. According to the story, the Emperor's eyes are half closed in sleep, but now and then he raises his hand and sends a boy out to see if the ravens have stopped flying.<ref>Brown, R. A., ''The Origins of Modern Europe'', Boydell Press, 1972, p. 172</ref>\n\n=== Middle East / Islamic culture ===\nIn [[Cain and Abel in Islam|the Qur'an's version of the story of Cain and Abel]], a raven is mentioned as the creature who taught Cain how to bury his murdered brother, in [[Al-Ma'ida]] (The Repast) 5:31. {Surah 5:27-31}<ref>http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/105271/religion/the_raven_in_bible_and_quran.html</ref>\n\nThe story, as presented in the Quran and further postulated in the hadith, states that Cain, having murdered Abel, was bereft of a means of disposing of his brother's body. While scanning the surroundings for a solution, Cain noticed two ravens, one dead and the other alive. The still living raven began digging the ground with its beak until a hole had been dug up, in which it buried its dead mate. Witnessing this, Cain discovered his solution, as indirectly revealed by God.\n\n===Germanic cultures and Viking Age===\n{{further|Raven Banner}}\n[[Image:Manuscript Odinn.jpg|thumb|An illustration from an 18th-century Icelandic manuscript depicting [[Huginn and Muninn]] sitting on the shoulders of [[Odin]].]]\nTo the [[Germanic peoples]], [[Odin]] was often associated with ravens. Examples include depictions of figures often identified as Odin appear flanked with two birds on a 6th-century [[bracteate]] and on a 7th-century helmet plate from [[Vendel]], Sweden. In later [[Norse mythology]], Odin is depicted as having two ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]] serving as his eyes and ears &ndash; ''huginn'' meaning \"thought\" and ''muninn'' meaning \"memory\". Each day the ravens fly out from [[Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf]] and bring Odin news from [[Midgard]].\n\nThe [[Old English language|Old English]] word for a raven was ''hr\u00e6fn''; in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] it was ''hrafn''; the word was frequently used in combinations as a [[kenning]] for bloodshed and battle.\n\nThe raven was a common device used by the [[Viking]]s. [[Ragnar Lothbrok]] had a [[raven banner]] called ''Reafan'', embroidered with the device of a raven. It was said that if this banner fluttered, Lothbrok would carry the day, but if it hung lifeless the battle would be lost. King [[Harald Hardrada]] also had a raven banner, called ''Landeythan'' (land-waster). The bird also appears in the folklore of the [[Isle of Man]], a former [[Viking]] colony, and it is used as a symbol on their [[Coat of arms of the Isle of Man|coat of arms]].\n\n===Insular Celtic traditions===\n[[File:Cuchulain_at_GPO.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sheppard]]'s sculpture of C\u00fa Chulainn at the Dublin GPO]]\n\nIn [[Irish mythology]] ravens are associated with warfare and the battleground in the figures of [[Badb]] and [[Morr\u00edgan]].

Like in many other cultures, the raven is associated with death - more specifically with an aftermath of a bloody or significant battle. Ravens often appear in pairs and play the role of harbingers of tragic news, usually announcing death of a hero or a group of heroes. They tend to appear in combination with female characters as receivers of the news. Usually, a mother or a wife of a hero will be notified about the hero's death by a visit from a pair of ravens. Sometimes, these are treated as supernatural creatures capable of communicating with humans that report about events directly. Alternatively, these are ordinary birds bringing along scavenged body parts, such as a hand or a finger with a ring, by which the fate of the hero will be recognised. The most notable examples of this pattern are found in the songs \"Car Lazar i Carica Milica\" (Tsar Lazar and Tsarina Militsa) and \"Boj na Mi\u0161aru\" ([[Battle of Mishar]]).\n\n===Hindu / South Asia===\n[[File:Dhumavati.JPG|thumb|Goddess [[Dhumavati]] riding a crow.]]\nIn the ''[[Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasistha#Section Six: On Liberation|Story of Bhusunda]]'', a chapter of the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', a very old sage in the form of a crow, Bhusunda, recalls a succession of epochs in the earth's history, as described in [[Hindu cosmology]].

The raven in these indigenous peoples' mythology is the [[Creator deity|Creator of the world]], but it is also considered a [[trickster]] god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For instance, in [[Tlingit people|Tlingit culture]], there are two different raven characters which can be identified, although they are not always clearly differentiated. One is the creator raven, responsible for bringing the world into being and who is sometimes considered to be the individual who brought light to the darkness. The other is the childish raven, always selfish, sly, conniving, and hungry. When the Great Spirit created all things he kept them separate and stored in cedar boxes. The Great Spirit gifted these boxes to the animals who existed before humans. When the animals opened the boxes all the things that comprise the world came into being. The boxes held such things as mountains, fire, water, wind and seeds for all the plants. One such box, which was given to Seagull, contained all the light of the world. Seagull coveted his box and refused to open it, clutching it under his wing. All the people asked Raven to persuade Seagull to open it and release the light. Despite begging, demanding, flattering and trying to trick him into opening the box, Seagull still refused. Finally Raven became angry and frustrated, and stuck a thorn in Seagull's foot. Raven pushed the thorn in deeper until the pain caused Seagull to drop the box. Then out of the box came the sun, moon and stars that brought light to the world and allowed the first day to begin.\n\n[[Bill Reid]] created the sculpture of ''The Raven and The First Men'' depicting a scene from a [[Haida people|Haida]] myth that unifies the Raven as both the [[trickster]] and the [[Creator deity|creator]]. According to this myth, the raven who was both bored and well fed, found and freed some creatures trapped in a [[clam]]. These scared and timid beings were the first men of the world, and they were coaxed out of the clam shell by the raven. Soon the raven was bored with these creatures and planned to return them to their shell. Instead, the raven decided to search for the female counterparts of these male beings. The raven found some female humans trapped in a [[chiton]], freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. The raven, always known as a [[trickster]], was responsible for the pairing of humans and felt very protective of them. With the Raven perceived as the [[Creator deity|creator]], many [[Haida people|Haida]] myths and legends often suggest the raven as a provider to mankind.\n\nAnother raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the \"Raven\" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.\n\nOne ancient story told on [[Haida Gwaii]] tells about how Raven helped to bring the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fresh Water, and Fire to the world:<ref>Clark, Ella E.: ''Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest'', [[University of California Press]], 1953.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Long ago, near the beginning of the world, Gray Eagle was the guardian of the Sun, Moon and Stars, of fresh water, and of fire. Gray Eagle hated people so much that he kept these things hidden. People lived in darkness, without fire and without fresh water.\n\nGray Eagle had a beautiful daughter, and Raven fell in love with her. In the beginning, Raven was a snow-white bird, and as a such, he pleased Gray Eagle's daughter. She invited him to her father's longhouse.\n\nWhen Raven saw the Sun, Moon and stars, and fresh water hanging on the sides of Eagle's lodge, he knew what he should do. He watched for his chance to seize them when no one was looking. He stole all of them, and a brand of fire also, and flew out of the longhouse through the smoke hole. As soon as Raven got outside he hung the Sun up in the sky. It made so much light that he was able to fly far out to an island in the middle of the ocean. When the Sun set, he fastened the Moon up in the sky and hung the stars around in different places. By this new light he kept on flying, carrying with him the fresh water and the brand of fire he had stolen.\n\nHe flew back over the land. When he had reached the right place, he dropped all the water he had stolen. It fell to the ground and there became the source of all the fresh-water streams and lakes in the world. Then Raven flew on, holding the brand of fire in his bill. The smoke from the fire blew back over his white feathers and made them black. When his bill began to burn, he had to drop the firebrand. It struck rocks and hid itself within them. That is why, if you strike two stones together, sparks of fire will drop out.\n\nRaven's feathers never became white again after they were blackened by the smoke from the firebrand. That is why Raven is now a black bird.}}\n\nOther notable stories tell of the Raven stealing and releasing the sun, and of the Raven tempting the first humans out of a clam shell. Another story of the Kwakiutl or [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] of [[British Columbia]] who exposed boys' placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions, thereby associating the raven with prophecy, similar to the traditions of [[Scandinavia]].\n\nIn one legend Raven transformed himself into a pine needle which is swallowed by the unmarried daughter of the owner of the box of daylight, who then becomes pregnant and gives birth to Raven in disguise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/singere/fakelore.html|title=Fakelore, Multiculturalism, and the Ethics of Children's Literature|last=Singer|first=Eliot A.}}</ref>\n\n===Siberia, Northern Asia===\n{{main |Kutkh}}\n\nThe raven god or spirit [[Kutcha]] (or [[Kutkh]], ({{lang|ru|\u041a\u0443\u0442\u0445}})) is important in the shamanic tradition of the [[Koryaks]] and other indigenous [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] peoples of the [[Russian Far East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mettaknowledge.com/archives/meeting-the-new-white-shamans|title=Meeting the New Shamans|last=Mann, PhD|first=Rachel|date=February 26, 2009|work=MettaKnowledge for Peace|publisher=Rachel Mann, PhD|accessdate=14 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305050047/http://www.mettaknowledge.com/archives/meeting-the-new-white-shamans|archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Turk|first=Jon|title=The Raven's Gift: A Scientist, a Shaman, and Their Remarkable Journey Through the Siberian Wilderness|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Raven_s_Gift.html?id=O-NOd4Kz1EwC&redir_esc=y|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=2010|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=1429964707}}</ref>\n\nKutcha is traditionally revered in various forms by various peoples and appears in many legends: as a key figure in [[Creation myth|creation]], as a fertile [[ancestor]] of mankind, as a mighty [[Shamanism|shaman]] and as a [[trickster]].

Most depictions allude to the appearance and behaviour of the wide-ranging [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax''). Because of its black plumage, croaking call and diet of [[carrion]], the raven is often associated with loss and ill omen. Yet its symbolism is complex. As a talking bird, the raven also represents [[prophecy]] and insight. Ravens in stories often act as [[psychopomp]]s, connecting the material world with the world of [[spirit]]s.\n\nFrench anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] proposed a [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory that suggests the raven (like the [[Coyote (mythology)|coyote]]) obtained mythic status because it was a mediator animal between life and death.<ref>Structural Anthropology, p. 224</ref> As a carrion bird, ravens became associated with the dead and with lost souls. In Swedish folklore, they are the ghosts of murdered people without Christian burials and, in German stories, damned souls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=birds.raven |title=Raven: The Northern Bird of Paradox |accessdate=2007-02-12 |last=Schwan |first=Mark |date=January 1990 |publisher=Alaska Fish and Game |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102055945/http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=birds.raven |archivedate=2010-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Symbolism and mythology by culture==\n[[Image:The-Twa-Corbies.jpg|thumb|\"[[The Twa Corbies]]\", Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''Some British [[Ballad]]s'']]\n\nThe Raven has appeared in the mythologies of many ancient peoples. Some of the more common stories are from those of Greek, Celtic, Norse, Pacific Northwest, and Roman mythology.\n\n===Greco-Roman antiquity===\nIn [[Greek mythology]], ravens are associated with [[Apollo]], the god of prophecy. They are said to be a symbol of bad luck, and were the god's messengers in the mortal world. According to the mythological narration, Apollo sent a white raven, or crow in some versions to spy on his lover, [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]]. When the raven brought back the news that Coronis had been unfaithful to him, Apollo scorched the raven in his fury, turning the animal's feathers black. That's why all ravens are black today.\n\nAccording to [[Livy]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Marcus Valerius Corvus]] (c. 370-270 BC) had a raven settle on his helmet during a combat with a gigantic Gaul, which distracted the enemy's attention by flying in his face.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]].

B. Tristram, [https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00trisuoft Natural History Bible] (9th ed.; London: Society Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1898), 198.</ref> and ravens are mentioned on numerous occasions thereafter. In the [[Book of Genesis]], Noah releases a raven from the ark after the great flood to test whether the waters have receded (Gen. 8:6-7). According to the Law of Moses, ravens are forbidden for food (Leviticus 11:15; Deuteronomy 14:14), a fact that may have colored the perception of ravens in later sources. In the [[Book of Judges]], one of Kings of the [[Midian]]ites defeated by [[Gideon]] is called \"[[Orev]]\" (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1) which means \"Raven\". In the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] 17:4-6, God commands the ravens to feed the prophet [[Elijah]]. [[King Solomon]] is described as having hair as black as a raven in the [[Song of Songs]] 5:11. Ravens are an example of God's gracious provision for all his creatures in Psalm 147:9 and Job 38:41. (In the [[New Testament]] as well, ravens are used by [[Jesus]] as an illustration of God's provision in [[Book of Luke|Luke]] 12:24.)\n\n[[Philo of Alexandria]] (first century AD), who interpreted the Bible allegorically, stated that Noah's raven was a symbol of vice, whereas the dove was a symbol of virtue (Questions and Answers on Genesis 2:38).\n\nIn the [[Talmud]], the raven is described as having been only one of three beings on [[Noah's Ark]] that copulated during the flood and so was punished.<ref name=Sanhedrin>Sanhedrin, 108b</ref> The Rabbis believed that the male raven was forced to ejaculate his seed into the female raven's mouth as a means of reproduction.<ref>b. Sanhedrin 108b. According to the Icelandic ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]''\u2014a story similar to Noah and the Ark -- [[Hrafna-Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arson]] used ravens to guide his ship from the Faroe Islands to Iceland.</ref>\n\n[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] (chapter 25) explains that the reason the raven Noah released from the ark did not return to him was that the raven was feeding on the corpses of those who drowned in the flood.<ref>This tradition is also preserved in the Byzantine composition ''Palaea Historica''. See David Flusser, \"''Palaea Historica'' An Unknown Source of Biblical Legends,\" ''Scripta Hieroslymitana'' 22 (1971): 48-79.</ref>\n\n===Late antiquity and Christian Middle Ages===\n[[Image:LSB.png|thumb|The ravens on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]] recall the story of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]]'s ravens.]]\n\nThe name of the important Frankish King [[Guntram]] means \"War Raven\".\n\nAccording to the legend of the fourth-century Iberian Christian [[martyr]] Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]], after St. Vincent was executed, ravens protected his body from being devoured by wild animals, until his followers could recover the body. His body was taken to what is now known as [[Cape St. Vincent]] in southern Portugal. A shrine was erected over his grave, which continued to be guarded by flocks of ravens. The Arab [[geographer]] [[Al-Idrisi]] noted this constant guard by ravens, for which the place was named by him \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628 \"Kan\u012bsah al-Ghur\u0101b\" (Church of the Raven). King [[Afonso Henriques]] (1139\u20131185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to [[Lisbon]], still accompanied by the ravens. This transfer of the relics is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]].\n\nA raven is also said to have protected [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]] by taking away a loaf of bread poisoned by jealous monks after he blessed it.\n\nIn the legends about the German Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], depicting him as [[King asleep in mountain|sleeping]]  along with his knights in a cave in the [[Kyffh\u00e4user]] mountain in [[Thuringia]] or the [[Untersberg]] in Bavaria, it is told that when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness. According to the story, the Emperor's eyes are half closed in sleep, but now and then he raises his hand and sends a boy out to see if the ravens have stopped flying.<ref>Brown, R. A., ''The Origins of Modern Europe'', Boydell Press, 1972, p. 172</ref>\n\n=== Middle East / Islamic culture ===\nIn [[Cain and Abel in Islam|the Qur'an's version of the story of Cain and Abel]], a raven is mentioned as the creature who taught Cain how to bury his murdered brother, in [[Al-Ma'ida]] (The Repast) 5:31. {Surah 5:27-31}<ref>http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/105271/religion/the_raven_in_bible_and_quran.html</ref>\n\nThe story, as presented in the Quran and further postulated in the hadith, states that Cain, having murdered Abel, was bereft of a means of disposing of his brother's body. While scanning the surroundings for a solution, Cain noticed two ravens, one dead and the other alive. The still living raven began digging the ground with its beak until a hole had been dug up, in which it buried its dead mate. Witnessing this, Cain discovered his solution, as indirectly revealed by God.\n\n===Germanic cultures and Viking Age===\n{{further|Raven Banner}}\n[[Image:Manuscript Odinn.jpg|thumb|An illustration from an 18th-century Icelandic manuscript depicting [[Huginn and Muninn]] sitting on the shoulders of [[Odin]].]]\nTo the [[Germanic peoples]], [[Odin]] was often associated with ravens. Examples include depictions of figures often identified as Odin appear flanked with two birds on a 6th-century [[bracteate]] and on a 7th-century helmet plate from [[Vendel]], Sweden. In later [[Norse mythology]], Odin is depicted as having two ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]] serving as his eyes and ears &ndash; ''huginn'' meaning \"thought\" and ''muninn'' meaning \"memory\". Each day the ravens fly out from [[Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf]] and bring Odin news from [[Midgard]].\n\nThe [[Old English language|Old English]] word for a raven was ''hr\u00e6fn''; in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] it was ''hrafn''; the word was frequently used in combinations as a [[kenning]] for bloodshed and battle.\n\nThe raven was a common device used by the [[Viking]]s. [[Ragnar Lothbrok]] had a [[raven banner]] called ''Reafan'', embroidered with the device of a raven. It was said that if this banner fluttered, Lothbrok would carry the day, but if it hung lifeless the battle would be lost. King [[Harald Hardrada]] also had a raven banner, called ''Landeythan'' (land-waster). The bird also appears in the folklore of the [[Isle of Man]], a former [[Viking]] colony, and it is used as a symbol on their [[Coat of arms of the Isle of Man|coat of arms]].\n\n===Insular Celtic traditions===\n[[File:Cuchulain_at_GPO.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sheppard]]'s sculpture of C\u00fa Chulainn at the Dublin GPO]]\n\nIn [[Irish mythology]] ravens are associated with warfare and the battleground in the figures of [[Badb]] and [[Morr\u00edgan]]. The goddess [[Morr\u00edgan]] alighted on the hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]]'s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death.<ref>\"The Death of Cu Chulainn\".

Like in many other cultures, the raven is associated with death - more specifically with an aftermath of a bloody or significant battle. Ravens often appear in pairs and play the role of harbingers of tragic news, usually announcing death of a hero or a group of heroes. They tend to appear in combination with female characters as receivers of the news. Usually, a mother or a wife of a hero will be notified about the hero's death by a visit from a pair of ravens. Sometimes, these are treated as supernatural creatures capable of communicating with humans that report about events directly. Alternatively, these are ordinary birds bringing along scavenged body parts, such as a hand or a finger with a ring, by which the fate of the hero will be recognised.

Because they are [[scavengers]], ravens have been associated with [[death]].]]\n\nThe raven also has a prominent role in the mythologies of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], including the [[Tsimishian]]s, [[Haida people|Haida]]s, [[Heiltsuk]]s, [[Tlingit]]s, [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]], [[Koyukon]]s, and [[Inuit]]. The raven in these indigenous peoples' mythology is the [[Creator deity|Creator of the world]], but it is also considered a [[trickster]] god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For instance, in [[Tlingit people|Tlingit culture]], there are two different raven characters which can be identified, although they are not always clearly differentiated. One is the creator raven, responsible for bringing the world into being and who is sometimes considered to be the individual who brought light to the darkness. The other is the childish raven, always selfish, sly, conniving, and hungry. When the Great Spirit created all things he kept them separate and stored in cedar boxes. The Great Spirit gifted these boxes to the animals who existed before humans. When the animals opened the boxes all the things that comprise the world came into being. The boxes held such things as mountains, fire, water, wind and seeds for all the plants. One such box, which was given to Seagull, contained all the light of the world. Seagull coveted his box and refused to open it, clutching it under his wing. All the people asked Raven to persuade Seagull to open it and release the light. Despite begging, demanding, flattering and trying to trick him into opening the box, Seagull still refused. Finally Raven became angry and frustrated, and stuck a thorn in Seagull's foot. Raven pushed the thorn in deeper until the pain caused Seagull to drop the box. Then out of the box came the sun, moon and stars that brought light to the world and allowed the first day to begin.\n\n[[Bill Reid]] created the sculpture of ''The Raven and The First Men'' depicting a scene from a [[Haida people|Haida]] myth that unifies the Raven as both the [[trickster]] and the [[Creator deity|creator]]. According to this myth, the raven who was both bored and well fed, found and freed some creatures trapped in a [[clam]]. These scared and timid beings were the first men of the world, and they were coaxed out of the clam shell by the raven. Soon the raven was bored with these creatures and planned to return them to their shell. Instead, the raven decided to search for the female counterparts of these male beings. The raven found some female humans trapped in a [[chiton]], freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. The raven, always known as a [[trickster]], was responsible for the pairing of humans and felt very protective of them. With the Raven perceived as the [[Creator deity|creator]], many [[Haida people|Haida]] myths and legends often suggest the raven as a provider to mankind.\n\nAnother raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the \"Raven\" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.\n\nOne ancient story told on [[Haida Gwaii]] tells about how Raven helped to bring the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fresh Water, and Fire to the world:<ref>Clark, Ella E.: ''Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest'', [[University of California Press]], 1953.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Long ago, near the beginning of the world, Gray Eagle was the guardian of the Sun, Moon and Stars, of fresh water, and of fire. Gray Eagle hated people so much that he kept these things hidden. People lived in darkness, without fire and without fresh water.\n\nGray Eagle had a beautiful daughter, and Raven fell in love with her. In the beginning, Raven was a snow-white bird, and as a such, he pleased Gray Eagle's daughter. She invited him to her father's longhouse.\n\nWhen Raven saw the Sun, Moon and stars, and fresh water hanging on the sides of Eagle's lodge, he knew what he should do. He watched for his chance to seize them when no one was looking. He stole all of them, and a brand of fire also, and flew out of the longhouse through the smoke hole. As soon as Raven got outside he hung the Sun up in the sky. It made so much light that he was able to fly far out to an island in the middle of the ocean. When the Sun set, he fastened the Moon up in the sky and hung the stars around in different places. By this new light he kept on flying, carrying with him the fresh water and the brand of fire he had stolen.\n\nHe flew back over the land. When he had reached the right place, he dropped all the water he had stolen. It fell to the ground and there became the source of all the fresh-water streams and lakes in the world. Then Raven flew on, holding the brand of fire in his bill. The smoke from the fire blew back over his white feathers and made them black. When his bill began to burn, he had to drop the firebrand. It struck rocks and hid itself within them. That is why, if you strike two stones together, sparks of fire will drop out.\n\nRaven's feathers never became white again after they were blackened by the smoke from the firebrand. That is why Raven is now a black bird.}}\n\nOther notable stories tell of the Raven stealing and releasing the sun, and of the Raven tempting the first humans out of a clam shell. Another story of the Kwakiutl or [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] of [[British Columbia]] who exposed boys' placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions, thereby associating the raven with prophecy, similar to the traditions of [[Scandinavia]].\n\nIn one legend Raven transformed himself into a pine needle which is swallowed by the unmarried daughter of the owner of the box of daylight, who then becomes pregnant and gives birth to Raven in disguise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/singere/fakelore.html|title=Fakelore, Multiculturalism, and the Ethics of Children's Literature|last=Singer|first=Eliot A.}}</ref>\n\n===Siberia, Northern Asia===\n{{main |Kutkh}}\n\nThe raven god or spirit [[Kutcha]] (or [[Kutkh]], ({{lang|ru|\u041a\u0443\u0442\u0445}})) is important in the shamanic tradition of the [[Koryaks]] and other indigenous [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] peoples of the [[Russian Far East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mettaknowledge.com/archives/meeting-the-new-white-shamans|title=Meeting the New Shamans|last=Mann, PhD|first=Rachel|date=February 26, 2009|work=MettaKnowledge for Peace|publisher=Rachel Mann, PhD|accessdate=14 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305050047/http://www.mettaknowledge.com/archives/meeting-the-new-white-shamans|archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Turk|first=Jon|title=The Raven's Gift: A Scientist, a Shaman, and Their Remarkable Journey Through the Siberian Wilderness|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Raven_s_Gift.html?id=O-NOd4Kz1EwC&redir_esc=y|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=2010|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=1429964707}}</ref>\n\nKutcha is traditionally revered in various forms by various peoples and appears in many legends: as a key figure in [[Creation myth|creation]], as a fertile [[ancestor]] of mankind, as a mighty [[Shamanism|shaman]] and as a [[trickster]].

He graduated in 1908 with a bachelor's degree in architecture. During his studies, Cheney also developed a love for theatre, inspired largely by performances of Greek drama he had attended at Berkeley\u2019s outdoor [[Hearst Greek Theatre]]. In the years immediately following his graduation, Cheney married Maud Maurice Turner and found intermittent work as an art and theatre critic.\n\nIn 1913, Cheney began studying drama at [[Harvard University]]. While there he attended the Boston installation of New York City's legendary [[Armory Show]], an experience of modern art which fostered Cheney's growing fascination with new art and theatre.

Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.\n\nMany critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'', and was placed twelfth on the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of top Indian films of all time.

Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]), while Raj's father Dharamvir Malhotra ([[Anupam Kher]]) is very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man; her mother Lajjo ([[Farida Jalal]]) warns her against this, saying dreams are good, but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit ([[Satish Shah]]), who lives in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago\u2014to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet ([[Parmeet Sethi]]). Simran is disappointed, as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.\n\nOne evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses, but Raj grabs a case of beer, throws money on the counter, and runs away. An infuriated Baldev calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to [[Zurich]] and are separated from their friends, but start to travel together and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey, and when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him as well. At home, Simran tells her mother about the boy she met on her trip; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes enraged with his daughter. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon get married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her.\n\nIn India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend, Ajit. A miserable Simran and her younger sister Chutki ([[Pooja Ruparel]]) take an instant dislike to Simran's fianc\u00e9 Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran pines for Raj, but her mother tells her to forget him because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, his father arrives in India and also becomes friends with Simran's and Kuljeet's families. Eventually, Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.\n\nAs Raj and his father wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Eventually, Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight, and Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran then arrives with her mother and sister; she tries to join Raj on the train, but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev, realising nobody loves his daughter more than Raj does, lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[British Film Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7e63fe2b |title=Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) BFI |year=2002 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601000634/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7e63fe2b |archive-date=1 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- ORDERING AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj Malhotra\n* [[Kajol]] as Simran Singh\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as Chaudhary Baldev Singh, Simran's father\n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Lajwanti \"Lajjo\" Singh, Simran's mother\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Ajit Singh, Baldev's friend in India\n* [[Achala Sachdev]] as Simran's grandmother\n* [[Himani Shivpuri]] as Kammo Kaur, Simran's aunt\n* [[Pooja Ruparel]] as Rajeshwari \"Chutki\" Singh, Simran's sister\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dharamvir Malhotra, Raj's father\n* [[Parmeet Sethi]] as Kuljeet Singh, Ajit's son\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Preeti Singh, Ajit's daughter\n* [[Anaita Shroff Adajania]] as Sheena, Simran's friend\n* [[Karan Johar]] and Arjun Sablok as Raj's friends Rocky and Robbie\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin and scripting ===\n[[Aditya Chopra]] assisted his father, director and producer [[Yash Chopra]], during the making of ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991) and ''[[Darr]]'' (1993).<ref name=adi /> During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' (2000).<ref name=Shahrukh /> For three years, he worked on the story that would become ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' before approaching his father to direct it.

Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}} After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the process. On 18 October, two days before the film's release, the 30-minute special ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making'' was broadcast on television by [[Doordarshan]].<ref name=\"Bookmyshow\" />{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}}\n\n== Themes ==\n''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|pp=305, 333}} To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story's \"good guy\", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners.{{sfn|Ganti|2004|p=42}} Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.{{sfn|Mehta|2011|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nThe story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=208}} Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires.{{sfn|Dengel-Janic|Eckstein|2008|p=51}} The film implies that \"Indianness\" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=160}}\n\nIn ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'', the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: \"You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl's ''[[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]'' (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.\" This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system,{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=158}} and the man's responsibility to protect the Indian woman's sexual purity.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=197}} In ''The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films'', Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj's father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran's mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.{{sfn|Mazumdar|2014|p=207}}\n\nScott Jordan Harris, writing for [[Roger Ebert]]'s website, says the film's popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, \"It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will\".<ref name=ebert /> Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage.{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=160}} According to Patricia Uberoi, ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' reiterates the theme of ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994){{efn|Uberoi states the theme to be that the lovers were willing to sacrifice their own feelings for their families.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}}} in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 1995\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{flatlist|\n*[[Bollywood music]]\n*[[Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n}}\n| length       = 38:46\n| label        = [[HMV]]\n| producer     = [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]]\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nThe ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' soundtrack features seven songs composed by [[Jatin Lalit]], a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit.

The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indians]], who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son.

It won 10 [[Filmfare Awards]]\u2014the most for a single film at that time\u2014and the [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment]]. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.\n\nMany critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'', and was placed twelfth on the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of top Indian films of all time. It is the longest-running film in the history of [[Indian cinema]]. As of 2019, over 20 years after its first release, it is still being shown at the [[Maratha Mandir]] theatre in [[Mumbai]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/25/asia/india-bollywood-ddlj/index.html |title=Bollywood's longest-running movie gets big screen reprieve |last=Shah |first=Khushbu |date=25 February 2015 |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot, it must be under 700 words -->\nRaj Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) and Simran Singh ([[Kajol]]) are non-resident Indians (NRI) living in [[London]]. Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]), while Raj's father Dharamvir Malhotra ([[Anupam Kher]]) is very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man; her mother Lajjo ([[Farida Jalal]]) warns her against this, saying dreams are good, but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit ([[Satish Shah]]), who lives in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago\u2014to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet ([[Parmeet Sethi]]). Simran is disappointed, as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.\n\nOne evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses, but Raj grabs a case of beer, throws money on the counter, and runs away. An infuriated Baldev calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to [[Zurich]] and are separated from their friends, but start to travel together and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey, and when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him as well. At home, Simran tells her mother about the boy she met on her trip; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes enraged with his daughter. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon get married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her.\n\nIn India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend, Ajit. A miserable Simran and her younger sister Chutki ([[Pooja Ruparel]]) take an instant dislike to Simran's fianc\u00e9 Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran pines for Raj, but her mother tells her to forget him because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, his father arrives in India and also becomes friends with Simran's and Kuljeet's families. Eventually, Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.\n\nAs Raj and his father wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Eventually, Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight, and Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran then arrives with her mother and sister; she tries to join Raj on the train, but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev, realising nobody loves his daughter more than Raj does, lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[British Film Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7e63fe2b |title=Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) BFI |year=2002 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601000634/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7e63fe2b |archive-date=1 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- ORDERING AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj Malhotra\n* [[Kajol]] as Simran Singh\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as Chaudhary Baldev Singh, Simran's father\n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Lajwanti \"Lajjo\" Singh, Simran's mother\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Ajit Singh, Baldev's friend in India\n* [[Achala Sachdev]] as Simran's grandmother\n* [[Himani Shivpuri]] as Kammo Kaur, Simran's aunt\n* [[Pooja Ruparel]] as Rajeshwari \"Chutki\" Singh, Simran's sister\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dharamvir Malhotra, Raj's father\n* [[Parmeet Sethi]] as Kuljeet Singh, Ajit's son\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Preeti Singh, Ajit's daughter\n* [[Anaita Shroff Adajania]] as Sheena, Simran's friend\n* [[Karan Johar]] and Arjun Sablok as Raj's friends Rocky and Robbie\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin and scripting ===\n[[Aditya Chopra]] assisted his father, director and producer [[Yash Chopra]], during the making of ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991) and ''[[Darr]]'' (1993).<ref name=adi /> During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' (2000).<ref name=Shahrukh /> For three years, he worked on the story that would become ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' before approaching his father to direct it.

''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' is believed to be the first Bollywood film with a \"Title suggested by\" credit.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|p=37}} The film has since become universally known by the acronym ''DDLJ''.<ref name=skj />{{sfn|Chopra|2002|p=8}}\n\nTowards the end of the [[principal photography]], Shah Rukh had to split his time between this film and ''[[Trimurti (film)|Trimurti]]'' (1995), spending half of his day on each film.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}} In early August{{nbsp}}1995, when filming on ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' was not yet finished, a release date in October around the time of the [[Diwali]] festival was decided upon. Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}} After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the process. On 18 October, two days before the film's release, the 30-minute special ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making'' was broadcast on television by [[Doordarshan]].<ref name=\"Bookmyshow\" />{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}}\n\n== Themes ==\n''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|pp=305, 333}} To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story's \"good guy\", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners.{{sfn|Ganti|2004|p=42}} Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.{{sfn|Mehta|2011|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nThe story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=208}} Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires.{{sfn|Dengel-Janic|Eckstein|2008|p=51}} The film implies that \"Indianness\" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=160}}\n\nIn ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'', the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: \"You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl's ''[[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]'' (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.\" This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system,{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=158}} and the man's responsibility to protect the Indian woman's sexual purity.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=197}} In ''The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films'', Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj's father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran's mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.{{sfn|Mazumdar|2014|p=207}}\n\nScott Jordan Harris, writing for [[Roger Ebert]]'s website, says the film's popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, \"It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will\".<ref name=ebert /> Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage.{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=160}} According to Patricia Uberoi, ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' reiterates the theme of ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994){{efn|Uberoi states the theme to be that the lovers were willing to sacrifice their own feelings for their families.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}}} in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 1995\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{flatlist|\n*[[Bollywood music]]\n*[[Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n}}\n| length       = 38:46\n| label        = [[HMV]]\n| producer     = [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]]\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nThe ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' soundtrack features seven songs composed by [[Jatin Lalit]], a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit.
