He also had brief stints in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]], and the [[World Wrestling Federation]].

He became a wrestling fan in the late 1950s. A childhood friend claimed that they were the first wrestling fans to bring signs to local [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] house shows. Around 1971, Smith also co-founded an unofficial [[fan club]] for [[Freddie Blassie]] with members wearing homemade \"Blassie's Army\" T-shirts.<ref name=Mantell/> In his early 20\u2019s Smith had an altercation with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] while attending a live event at [[Sunnyside Gardens]]. Sullivan had been hit with an unknown object at the end of his bout against Davey O'Hannon. Smith, who often cheered for the \"[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]\" wrestlers, had been heckling Sullivan (then a \"[[babyface (professional wrestling)|babyface]]\") throughout the night causing the wrestler to believe that Smith was responsible. The young wrestling fan was brought to the dressing room by building security after the match where he was confronted by Sullivan, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Arnold Skaaland]]. Smith denied any wrongdoing and was allowed to leave.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is2.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #2 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228074819/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is2.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith continued watching wrestling after moving to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] in the mid-1970s. He eventually met [[Norvell Austin]] at a [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Southeastern Championship Wrestling]]. Austin later introduced Smith to Rick Conner who agreed to train him.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career===\nSmith made his pro debut in 1976. He spent the next two years wrestling for [[List of outlaw wrestling promotions|\"outlaw\" promotions]] as \"Pretty Smitty from New York City\" in Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. One of his earliest matches was a [[professional wrestling battle royal|battle royal]] in which all the participants wore masks. Smith had never been in such an event and, after being thrown over the top rope, broke his leg in three places. He was pelted with [[Coke bottle|Coke cans]] and other items by unruly fans while paramedics loaded him into the ambulance. The crowd's reaction convinced him to perform as a \"heel\" for the majority of his career.<ref name=KM-Smith20>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is20.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #20 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228080300/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is20.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> On September 16, 1978, Smith (substituting for Tamaya Soto) wrestled Burr Head Jones for an [[NWA Mid-America]] television taping at the [[Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Auditorium|Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He later felt the match was \"garbage\". Smith attributed his poor performance to nervousness as he was used to wrestling in front of much smaller crowds. After the match, Smith was berated by promoter [[Nick Gulas]] in front of the entire locker room. Although Gulas' [[booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] Tom Renesto reassured Smith that he was welcome to return, Smith felt Gulas had acted unprofessionally and refused to work for him again.<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref name=Mantell/>\n\n===American Wrestling Association===\nNot long after, Smith was brought into George and Gil Culkin's [[American Wrestling Association]]-affiliated promotion in Mississippi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://percypringle.com/Story-Time/StoryTime-LookingBack2.html |title=LOOKING BACK AT THE BEGINNING \u2013 Part 2 |author=Pringle, Percy |author-link=Percy Pringle |date= |website=PercyPringle.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://culkinpromotions.blogspot.com/2013/10/paying-my-respects.html |title=Paying My Respects |author=Culkin, Gil |date=October 6, 2013 |website=CulkinPromotions.com |publisher=Mississippi Wrestling Memories |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith's old trainer Rick Conner recommended him to then booker Frankie Caine praising his interview skills. Caine decided to use Smith as a manager believing he had potential as an on-screen character. Smith credited Caine for creating the Izzy Slapawitz character and working with him to further develop the gimmick. Slapawitz was initially presented as a shady New York City businessman who owned a chain of [[pawn shops]] throughout the city. In first television appearance, however, Southern audiences mistook \"pawn shop\" for \"[[porn shop]]\" due Smith's thick [[New York accent]]. His introduction elicited some mild controversy at the time and that aspect of the character was quickly dropped. In spite of this rough start, Smith was well liked by Caine and the Culkins. He formed the first version of the Slapawitz Syndicate with [[Rip Rogers]] and The Japanese Wrecking Crew (Oki Shikina and Mr. Fugi).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is8.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #8 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028034018/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is8.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> One of the first targets of the Slapawitz Syndicate was Joey Rossi who was harassed by the group, and Smith in particular, for several weeks while the Culkins were running shows in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Smith was unexpectedly forced into a bout with Rossi which led to the manager wrestling his first-ever match in the territory. Unlike the typical \"cowardly\" wrestling manager, Smith aggressively brawled with Rossi and was disqualified in their best two of three falls match. The bout was covered by the Vicksburg's daily newspaper with a front-page story entitled \"Tougher Then They Thought\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is23.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #23 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228083644/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is23.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nShikina and Fugi quickly captured the promotion's Mississippi and U.S. Heavyweight Championships under Slapawitz's leadership. Smith's stable soon became involved in a \"heel vs. heel\" feud against [[Paul Bearer|Percy Pringle]] and AWA Tag Team Champions The Mongolians (Tio and Tapu). Slapawitz and Pringle faced each other in six-man tag team matches as well as in a variety of specialty matches throughout Mississippi in 1978.<ref name=Mantell/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://culkinpromotions.blogspot.com/2011/07/some-great-talent-on-1970s-icw.html |title=Some Great Talent on the 1970\"s ICW Wrestling Cards in Mississippi  |author=Culkin, Gil |date=July 8, 2011 |website=CulkinPromotions.com |publisher=Mississippi Wrestling Memories |accessdate=}}</ref> One of their most infamous matches was a bloody [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Texas Bull Rope match]] at the [[Mississippi Coliseum]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://percysposts.blogspot.com/2008/06/slapped-by-slapawitz.html |title=SLAPPED BY SLAPAWITZ |author=Pringle, Percy |date=June 13, 2008 |website=PercysPosts.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> that ended in a double-countout when the brawl spilled outside of the ring and into the backstage area. The feud concluded the following week at the Mississippi Coliseum with Slapawitz and The Japanese Wrecking Crew defeating Pringle and The Mongolians in a \"[[Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves Town]]\" [[Steel Cage match]]; due to the pre-match stipulations, the Slapawitz Syndicate won all four titles<ref name=IzzyShoot/> in addition to $5,000.

Then [[NWA Tri-State]] promoter [[Leroy McGuirk]] felt that the \"Izzy Slapawitz\" name might offend the large [[American Jews|Jewish American]] population in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and changed it to Ilya Zinervitch. When Caine left the promotion after a falling out with McGuirk, [[Skandor Akbar]] replaced him as booker. Akbar believed that the territory could only support one \"heel\" manager, however, he offered to put Smith under hood so he could wrestle as a [[masked wrestler]]. Smith turned him down as had been on the road for a considerable length of time and wanted to return to Knoxville so he could spend more time with his family.<ref name=KM-Smith21>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is21.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #21 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228081233/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is21.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith and Harris left the territory after losing a \"loser leaves town\" match to [[Jimmy Garvin]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref name=Mantell/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is6.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #6 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228091825/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is6.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===All-Star Championship Wrestling===\nSmith joined a local \"outlaw\" promotion called [[All-Star Championship Wrestling]] soon after returning to Knoxville. The organization was formed by [[Ronnie Garvin]], [[Bob Roop]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Boris Malenko]] after leaving [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Southeastern Championship Wrestling]] and was running in opposition to NWA promoter [[Robert Fuller]]. Yasau Fugi, one of his former charges, encouraged Smith to contact then booker Ronnie Garvin. Although the territory was struggling in its promotional war against Fuller, Garvin agreed to hire him.<ref name=KM-Smith21/> In January 1980, Smith made his first television appearance scouting for new talent. Initially managing [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Barry Orton|Barry O]], this new version of the Slapawitz Syndicate included Boris Malenko, [[Randy Savage]], Rip Rogers, and Tony Peters.<ref name=IPU-TV>{{cite web |url=http://icwpoffouniverse.webs.com/tvshows.htm |title=TV Shows |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2006 |website= |publisher=ICW Poffo Universe |accessdate=}}</ref> Peters quickly won the [[ICW Southeastern Heavyweight Championship]] under his management.\n\nSmith led his stable against Ronnie Garvin, Bob Roop and other fan favorites. One of the highlights during this period was when Smith faked a heart attack during a match with Roop to avoid wrestling him. On January 19, 1980, Smith was in the corner of Bob Orton, Jr. in a \"loser gets painted yellow\" match against Ronnie Garvin at [[WNOX (AM)|WNOX Auditorium]]. If Garvin won, Smith would have been forced to spend 2 minutes in the ring with him. On March 15, Smith teamed with The Destroyer in a handicap match against Garvin. Two weeks later, Garvin was lured into a \"loser leaves town\" match in exchange for a title shot against Tony Peters. Smith, however, was barred from ringside during the bout. A brawl between members of the Slapawitz Syndicate and Ronnie Garvin at the WNOX Auditorium resulted in Smith throwing a fireball for the first time in the territory.<ref name=Smith22/> Smith's actions caused a riot with fans tearing the seats out of the floor and throwing them at the wrestlers. Smith and his men were able to escape the building unharmed. A fan pulled a knife on Smith outside but he was disarmed by Tony Peters. The incident caused All Star Wrestling to lose access to the venue.<ref name=Smith22>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is22.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #22 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228082547/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is22.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]], he led the Orton brothers to the [[ICW Southeastern Tag Team Championship|Southern Tag Team Championship]] when they defeated Terry Gibbs and Bob Roop.

When All Star merged with ICW, Smith was among the wrestlers who opted to join the sister promotion in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Smith and other All Star Wrestling stars were regulars on ICW's weekly television show prior to and following the merger. Slapawitz Syndicate members Barry Orton and Tony Peters did not make the move to Kentucky<ref name=Mantell/> The ICW version of the Slapawitz Syndicate consisted of Bob Orton Jr., [[One Man Gang|Crusher Broomfield]], Rip Rogers, and the Devil's Duo (Doug Vines and Jeff Sword). [[Randy Savage]] and his manager Steve Cooper were also members for a time, most notably during their feud with [[midget wrestler]] Wee Willie.<ref name=IPU-TV/><ref name=SLAM/> Smith's look varied depending on the territory he worked. In Knoxville, he dressed in a black robe and sported long bushy hair and beard. In real-life, Smith would sometime have trouble getting a hotel room because of his appearance.<ref name=Mantell/> He also carried a whistle which he used to annoy fans at ringside.<ref name=KM-4b>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp4-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #4 Page #2 |author=Webber, Steve |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nSmith and his stable continued their feud against the fan favorites of the territory. In August 1980, Smith and Bob Orton, Jr. were involved in a controversial angle when they interfered in a match between Barry O and Ronnie Garvin. As Orton distracted the referee, Smith injected Garvin with an unknown substance that made the wrestler \"foam at the mouth\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp6.htm |title=ICW ANGLES |author=Webber, Steve |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp9.htm |title=Regional Territories: ICW (Poffo) #9 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> ICW officials immediately disqualified Barry O and suspended Bob Orton, Jr. from a championship tournament to crown the first [[ICW Television Championship|ICW Television Champion]]. Orton was able to sneak into the tournament as the [[masked wrestler]] The Best but was eliminated by Bob Roop in the quarter-finals.<ref name=IPU-Titles/>\n\nIn the following weeks, Smith and Bob Orton, Jr. were hounded about the identity of The Best. On the September 6th edition of ''International Championship Wrestling'', Lanny Poffo brought out a sports bag he \"found\" to the announcers desk while Orton (with Smith in his corner) wrestled [[Pez Whatley|\"Pistol\" Pez Whatley]]. Searching the bag, he showed co-announcer John Back and the studio audience the mask and wrestling tights worn by The Best. He quickly put the items back inside and returned backstage. Smith eventually noticed the bag on the desk, unaware that Poffo had opened the bag, and began blowing his whistle at Orton. The panicked wrestler left the ring, grabbed the sports bag, and hurried with Smith back to the locker room. Orton was counted out as a result. Later on, Bob Roop confronted Smith and Orton with the bag during a TV interview. When Orton insisted the bag was not his, Roop used a knife to rip it into shreds to see Orton\u2019s reaction. To the crowd's amusement, Orton was clearly distraught as the expensive bag was destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp15-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #15  Page #2 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith and Orton showed up the following week's episode and brought out midget wrestler Mighty Cupid who claimed the $500 bag was his. In an attempt to garner sympathy with the crowd, Orton promised to take the $500 out on Roop.<ref name=IPU-TV/>\n\nOn September 20, 1980, the Devil's Duo made their ICW television debut with an impressive win over George Weingeroff and Jim Pride. The team's name was created by promoter [[Angelo Poffo]] who was part of the original Devil's Duo with Chris Markoff and manager [[Bobby Heenan]] during the 1960s. As their manager, Smith accompanied them to the ring holding a book he called the \"Kaba Kaba\" and muttering supposedly occult phrases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp3-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #3 Page #2 |author=Webber, Steve |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> These theatrical hints of mock-satanism helped to put the team over with the fans but also limited their exposure, as many other territories at that time were too 'Bible Belt' for any satanism gimmick to be used. Nevertheless, the team quickly established themselves as top contenders for the promotion's U.S. and Southeastern Tag Team titles. On April 25, 1981, Smith led the Devil's Duo to the [[ICW United States Tag Team Championship]], which they won from [[Lanny Poffo]] and George Weingeroff at [[Henry Clay High School]]. He threw a fireball to help his team win the tag team title.<ref name=IPU-Titles/> Shortly after their victory, Smith went on live TV to congratulate his team for winning the belts and bragged to the crowd about the amount of \"fan mail\" his champions had received. He also mentioned a letter from \"his cousin overseas\" and suddenly displayed a picture of [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]. This upset many in audience as the U.S. was still in the midst of the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian hostage crisis]]. Smith continued to taunt the crowd and ended by turning to the camera asking \"Oh yeah? Well, how many hostages do YOU have?\". Before the end of the show, a mob had formed outside the TV studio. The wrestlers were trapped in the building until a police escort arrived. The promotion had to arrange special security for the trio for the next several months.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\nOn May 6, Smith and the Devil's Duo entered in a $10,000 battle royal held in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]. Smith was one of the final three participants along with Jeff Sword and Ronnie Garvin. As Garvin was attempting a [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] on Sword, a masked man entered the ring, climbed to the top rope and hit Garvin with a [[lumber|2x4]]. This allowed Sword to toss Garvin out of the ring. The masked wrestler, later called The Destroyer, turned his attention towards the two remaining men. Still holding the 2x4, The Destroyer stared them down but withdrew when Doug Vines joined his teammates.<ref name=IPU-TV/><ref name=\"KM-18\"/> Smith was declared the winner of the battle royal. On his way out of the ring, Smith dropped the $10,000 check. A fan picked it up and saw it had [[Cheque#Dishonoured cheques|\"void\" written across it]]. The promotion explained this by claiming that the ring check was ceremonial and that the winner would be given the actual one within a few days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnlisterwriting.com/wrestling.html |title=Professional wrestling |author=Lister, John |date= |website=JohnListerWriting.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThat summer, Smith was attacked by fans during an ICW house show in Illinois. It was during a rematch against Poffo and Weingeroff that Smith secretly handed a chain to one of his men. The event was held in a high school gym without guardrails or security and angry fans were able to surround the manager. Poffo and Weingeroff convinced the crowd to hand Smith to them and the wrestlers quickly rushed him back to the dressing room. Smith sustained a swollen knee from the assault and believed that he would have sustained more serious injuries had his opponents not intervened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is3.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #3 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228083808/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is3.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> It was this incident that led to his decision to leave the territory.<ref name=IzzyShoot/> Smith blamed Angelo Poffo for not hiring security to work at the event which led to a verbal altercation with the promoter. Poffo ordered Smith and his team to turn over the tag team belts. He also had Slapawitz Syndicate member Barry Orton, Jr. surrender his Southeastern title. But Smith was not alone as many others had grown tired of the excessive traveling, low payoffs and poor working conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is13.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #13 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228063655/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is13.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> The Poffo family's feud with [[Jerry Jarrett]] and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] had also alienated Smith and others who had friends in the Memphis territory.

Renesto wanted him to appear for its annual battle royal at the [[Olympic Auditorium]] where he would win the [[NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=Mantell/> The Devil's Duo were also to have a title run with the [[NWA Americas Tag Team Championship]]s. Smith and his men planned to go in late 1981. The three backed out at the last minute, however, as the Knoxville territory was doing so well and were also being discouraged from wrestlers coming back from Los Angeles. NWA Hollywood Wrestling closed down the following year.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\n===Southern Championship Wrestling===\nShortly after leaving ICW, Smith joined [[Jim Crockett Promotions#1980s|Southern Championship Wrestling]] based [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Owned by [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Ric Flair]], the small promotion also had the backing of [[Jim Crockett Promotions|NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] owner [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]]. Smith contacted [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who was booking for SCW and agreed to use him albeit on the bottom of the card. Smith's first appearance was a house show in Virginia where he was a last-minute replacement for [[Archie Gouldie|The Mongolian Stomper]] in the tag team main event against Blackjack Mulligan and [[Barry Windham|Blackjack Mulligan, Jr.]]. Neither Smith or the promoters were aware that they were in an area where local wrestling fans received ICW television. The crowd immediately recognized Smith as Izzy Slapowitz and loudly booed him as he entered the ring. The strong fan reaction impressed Blackjack Mulligan and used Smith as a mid-card performer for the rest of the time in the promotion. Sullivan also remembered Smith from the Sunnyside Gardens incident ten years earlier. The wrestler no longer held a grudge towards Smith and they became good friends while in the promotion.<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is2-2.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #2, Page 2 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229200511/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is2-2.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nTwo weeks after Slapawitz's debut, the Devil's Duo were brought into the territory from ICW. Many of the Virginia towns that SCW ran in, such as [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], were part of the [[Bible Belt]] and it was felt that the name might turn off fans from attending shows. The team's name was changed to \"The Hollywood Blondes\" and they were initially managed by Jimmy Holiday. Smith rejoined the Devil's Duo when Holiday left to work in the Mid-Atlantic territory. Smith held dual roles as both a manager and wrestler during this period. He mainly appeared in a \"wrestling manager\" role for Mulligan's shows in the Knoxville end of the territory and wrestled for the co-promotional shows with Crockett's side of the territory in [[Greater Richmond Region|Central Virginia area]].<ref name=IzzyShoot/> Among his opponents included Ron Wright and [[Denny Brown|Dennis Brown]], defeating the latter in bouts at the [[Salem Civic Center]] and the [[Berglund Center|Roanoke Civic Center]]. Smith also wrestled both [[Terry Taylor]] and his former trainer Rick Connors to time-limit draws on SCW television. Additionally, he accompanied Kevin Sullivan and [[Ray Candy]] as a manager.\n\n===Georgia Championship Wrestling===\nSmith was among the SCW roster Mulligan sent to [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] television tapings. In the fall of 1981, Smith made a number of appearances at [[WPCH-TV|WTBS Studios]] in [[Atlanta]]. His first GCW television appearance was a tag team match with Dave Forrester against [[George Wells (wrestler)|George Wells]] and [[Steve Olsonoski|Steve O]] on the September 12th 1981 edition of ''Georgia Championship Wrestling''.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 12, 1981 | title=NWA (1977\u20131984) DISC # 5 \u2013 1981/09/12 | url =http://wrestlingdvd.net/collection/nwa-1977-1984.html  | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=WrestlingDVD.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 12, 1981 | title=Georgia Championship Wrestling | url =http://www.savatage.com/wrest/usa/georgia.html | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=Savatage.com}}</ref> Smith teamed with [[Mike Sharpe|Iron Mike Sharpe]] against Wells and [[David Sammartino|Bruno Sammartino Jr.]] the following week.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 12, 1981 | title=NWA (1977\u20131984) DISC # 6 \u2013 1981/09/19 | url =http://wrestlingdvd.net/collection/nwa-1977-1984.html | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=WrestlingDVD.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 19, 1981 | title=Georgia Championship Wrestling | url =http://www.savatage.com/wrest/usa/georgia.html | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=Savatage.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdrwrestling.net/2010/01/11/gcw-on-wtbs-09-19-81/ |title=GCW on WTBS (09.19.81) |author= |date=January 11, 2010 |website=PDRwrestling.net |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> In his last GCW appearance, Smith and Jose Medina lost to The Oates Brothers (Jerry Oates and Ted Oates) on the October 3rd 1981 episode of ''Georgia Championship Wrestling''.\n\n===Maple Leaf Wrestling===\nOn November 15, 1981, Smith and Doug Vines made a one-time appearance in [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] for their 50th anniversary show at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] where they lost to [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]] and [[Tony Parisi (wrestler)|Tony Parisi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mapleleafwrestling.4t.com/previousupdates/nov151981.html |title=Nov 15, 1981 \u2013 50th Anniversary |author=Calvert, Andrew |date= |website=MapleLeafWrestling.com |publisher=Maple Leaf Wrestling \u2013 Pictorial |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008215055/http://mapleleafwrestling.4t.com/previousupdates/nov151981.html |archivedate=October 8, 2015 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/mapleleaf/mapleleaf5-2.htm |title=Maple Leaf #5 Page #2 |author=Calvert, Andrew |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith had been sent to Canada by Mulligan for a one-time appearance. However, the [[Frank Tunney|Tunney family]] were so impressed by Smith that they made him an offer to work in the Toronto wrestling territory the morning he was checking out of his hotel. Smith declined the offer as he did not want to move his family to Canada. While at the show, Smith was photographed backstage with Charlie Fulton and [[Mike Miller (wrestler)|Mike Miller]] watching [[Big John Studd]] demonstrating a facerake on Doug Vines.

One of their Crockett shows was at a [[state fair]] in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] on November 19, 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prowrestling1970present.blogspot.com/2010/09/harrisonburgva-nov191981.html |title=Harrisonburg,VA \u2013 Nov.19,1981 |author=Hall, Steve |date=September 12, 2010 |website= |publisher=Pro Wrestling 1970 To Present |accessdate=}}</ref> The local promoter had booked Smith to wrestle Doug Vines apparently unaware that \"Izzy Slapowitz\" was managing Vines in Knoxville. Smith knew the local fans would be confused, especially as the two wrestlers had spent the day walking around the fair. To protect [[kayfabe]], the two decided to change the match at the last minute. Smith announced to the crowd that they were wrestling each other to show the audience how tough they were and vowed that \"blood would be spilled\". Smith and Vines then proceeded to wrestle a [[hardcore wrestling|hardcore-style brawl]], involving chairs and the ringposts, that ended in a double-disqualification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is9.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #9 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228100909/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is9.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> On December 26, 1981, Smith wrestled [[Abe Jacobs]], the one-time \"Jewish Heavyweight Champion\", in [[Greenville, North Carolina]] losing via referee's decision.\n\nAccording to Smith, the Devil's Duo were originally going to compete in a championship tournament for the then vacant [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship]] and win the titles. [[Ole Anderson]], who was booking JCP at the time, instead split the trio up. In their first TV appearance for the company, Doug Vines and Jeff Sword wrestled in singles matches while Smith, whose name was changed, was put in a tag team match. When the three men returned to Knoxville the following day, they told Mulligan what had happened and the promoter drove to Charlotte where he confronted Anderson in the dressing room. Smith later speculated that their problems with Ole Anderson may have stemmed from real-life animosity between the two.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\nThe Devil's Duo remained the top \"heel\" tag team in SCW even after Crockett took full control of the Knoxville territory. The trio continued to have difficulty with Ole Anderson who cancelled many of their shows scheduled by assistant booker [[Johnny Weaver]] in early 1982. Smith decided to quit when all of his bookings were suddenly dropped except for a single show in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. The last-ever appearance of Slapawitz and Devil's Duo was supposed to be a six-man tag team match in Knoxville against [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Jimmy Valiant]] and Johnny Weaver. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] had taken over as booker shortly afterwards. Smith had a very good relationship with Rhodes who expressed interest in using the Devil's Duo. Jeff Sword had lost interest in pro wrestling by this time and, after a brief stint as [[The Assassins (professional wrestling)|Assassin #2]], left the business.<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref name=Mantell/>\n\n===Later career===\nWhile Doug Vines stayed with JCP, Smith chose not to return to JCP. He began scaling back his wrestling schedule during the mid-to-late 1980s. His last major run was working for Bill Needham's All Star Championship Wrestling in northeastern Tennessee.<ref name=KM-4b/> One of his most memorable moments in the promotion was when he faked a heart attack during a bare knuckles match against Rick Conner in 1990. It was also in ASCW that Smith was reunited with The Devil's Duo. The team won the ASCW Tag Team Championship twice and Doug Vines won the ASCW Heavyweight Championship five times.<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|edition=4th |year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> On January 8, 1991, he made a brief appearance on ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' taping against [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] at [[UTC Arena]] in Chattanooga.<ref name=SLAM/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=1991 |author=Cawthon, Graham |date= |website=TheHistoryofWWE.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nSmith went into retirement after the close of ASCW in 1992. He returned to New York and worked as an insurance salesman until the mid-2000s due to health problems. In 2007, Smith underwent emergency ascending [[aortic dissection]] surgery. The lengthy recovery period and blood pressure medication he was put on prevented him from working as a sales rep. Smith was still receiving cardiac therapy for his heart four years after his surgery. In May 2011, he was interviewed by [[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]] regarding the death of Randy Savage.<ref name=SLAM>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2011/05/23/18182876.html |title=Savage memory: Slapawitz on Macho Man's early days |author=Johnson, Steven |date=May 24, 2011 |website=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]] |publisher=SLAM!

He became a wrestling fan in the late 1950s. A childhood friend claimed that they were the first wrestling fans to bring signs to local [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] house shows. Around 1971, Smith also co-founded an unofficial [[fan club]] for [[Freddie Blassie]] with members wearing homemade \"Blassie's Army\" T-shirts.<ref name=Mantell/> In his early 20\u2019s Smith had an altercation with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] while attending a live event at [[Sunnyside Gardens]].

Smith, who often cheered for the \"[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]\" wrestlers, had been heckling Sullivan (then a \"[[babyface (professional wrestling)|babyface]]\") throughout the night causing the wrestler to believe that Smith was responsible. The young wrestling fan was brought to the dressing room by building security after the match where he was confronted by Sullivan, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Arnold Skaaland]].

He spent the next two years wrestling for [[List of outlaw wrestling promotions|\"outlaw\" promotions]] as \"Pretty Smitty from New York City\" in Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. One of his earliest matches was a [[professional wrestling battle royal|battle royal]] in which all the participants wore masks. Smith had never been in such an event and, after being thrown over the top rope, broke his leg in three places. He was pelted with [[Coke bottle|Coke cans]] and other items by unruly fans while paramedics loaded him into the ambulance.

Caine decided to use Smith as a manager believing he had potential as an on-screen character. Smith credited Caine for creating the Izzy Slapawitz character and working with him to further develop the gimmick. Slapawitz was initially presented as a shady New York City businessman who owned a chain of [[pawn shops]] throughout the city. In first television appearance, however, Southern audiences mistook \"pawn shop\" for \"[[porn shop]]\" due Smith's thick [[New York accent]]. His introduction elicited some mild controversy at the time and that aspect of the character was quickly dropped. In spite of this rough start, Smith was well liked by Caine and the Culkins. He formed the first version of the Slapawitz Syndicate with [[Rip Rogers]] and The Japanese Wrecking Crew (Oki Shikina and Mr. Fugi).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is8.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #8 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028034018/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is8.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> One of the first targets of the Slapawitz Syndicate was Joey Rossi who was harassed by the group, and Smith in particular, for several weeks while the Culkins were running shows in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Smith was unexpectedly forced into a bout with Rossi which led to the manager wrestling his first-ever match in the territory. Unlike the typical \"cowardly\" wrestling manager, Smith aggressively brawled with Rossi and was disqualified in their best two of three falls match. The bout was covered by the Vicksburg's daily newspaper with a front-page story entitled \"Tougher Then They Thought\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is23.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #23 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228083644/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is23.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nShikina and Fugi quickly captured the promotion's Mississippi and U.S. Heavyweight Championships under Slapowitz's leadership.

Then [[NWA Tri-State]] promoter [[Leroy McGuirk]] felt that the \"Izzy Slapawitz\" name might offend the large [[American Jews|Jewish American]] population in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and changed it to Ilya Zinervitch. When Caine left the promotion after a falling out with McGuirk, [[Skandor Akbar]] replaced him as booker. Akbar believed that the territory could only support one \"heel\" manager, however, he offered to put Smith under hood so he could wrestle as a [[masked wrestler]]. Smith turned him down as had been on the road for a considerable length of time and wanted to return to Knoxville so he could spend more time with his family.<ref name=KM-Smith21>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is21.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #21 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228081233/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is21.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith and Harris left the territory after losing a \"loser leaves town\" match to [[Jimmy Garvin]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref name=Mantell/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is6.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #6 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228091825/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is6.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===All-Star Championship Wrestling===\nSmith joined a local \"outlaw\" promotion called [[All-Star Championship Wrestling]] soon after returning to Knoxville. The organization was formed by [[Ronnie Garvin]], [[Bob Roop]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Boris Malenko]] after leaving [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Southeastern Championship Wrestling]] and was running in opposition to NWA promoter [[Robert Fuller]]. Yasau Fugi, one of his former charges, encouraged Smith to contact then booker Ronnie Garvin. Although the territory was struggling in its promotional war against Fuller, Garvin agreed to hire him.<ref name=KM-Smith21/> In January 1980, Smith made his first television appearance scouting for new talent. Initially managing [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Barry Orton|Barry O]], this new version of the Slapawitz Syndicate included Boris Malenko, [[Randy Savage]], Rip Rogers, and Tony Peters.<ref name=IPU-TV>{{cite web |url=http://icwpoffouniverse.webs.com/tvshows.htm |title=TV Shows |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2006 |website= |publisher=ICW Poffo Universe |accessdate=}}</ref> Peters quickly won the [[ICW Southeastern Heavyweight Championship|Southeastern Heavyweight Champion]] under his management.\n\nSmith led his stable against Ronnie Garvin, Bob Roop and other fan favorites. One of the highlights during this period was when Smith faked a heart attack during a match with Roop to avoid wrestling him. On January 19, 1980, Smith was in the corner of Bob Orton, Jr. in a \"loser gets painted yellow\" match against Ronnie Garvin at [[WNOX (AM)|WNOX Auditorium]]. If Garvin won, Smith would have been forced to spend 2 minutes in the ring with him. On March 15, Smith teamed with The Destroyer in a handicap match against Garvin. Two weeks later, Garvin was lured into \"loser leaves town\" match in exchange for a title shot against Tony Peters. Smith, however, was barred from ringside during the bout. A brawl between members of the Slapawitz Syndicate and Ronnie Garvin at the WNOX Auditorium resulted in Smith throwing a fireball for the first time in the territory.<ref name=Smith22/> Smith's actions caused a riot with fans tearing the seats out of the floor and throwing them at the wrestlers. Smith and his men were able to escape the building unharmed. A fan pulled a knife on Smith outside but he was disarmed by Tony Peters. The incident caused All Star Wrestling to lose access to the venue.<ref name=Smith22>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is22.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #22 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228082547/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is22.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]], he led the Orton brothers to the [[ICW Southeastern Tag Team Championship|Southern Tag Team Championship]] when they defeated Terry Gibbs and Bob Roop.

When All Star merged with ICW, Smith was among the wrestlers who opted to join the sister promotion in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Smith and other All Star Wrestling stars were regulars on ICW's weekly television show prior to and following the merger. Slapawitz Syndicate members Barry Orton and Tony Peters did not make the move to Kentucky<ref name=Mantell/> The ICW version of the Slapawitz Syndicate consisted of Bob Orton Jr., [[One Man Gang|Crusher Broomfield]], Rip Rogers, and the Devil's Duo (Doug Vines and Jeff Sword). [[Randy Savage]] and his manager Steve Cooper were also members for a time, most notably during their feud with [[midget wrestler]] Wee Willie.<ref name=IPU-TV/><ref name=SLAM/> Smith's look varied depending on the territory he worked. In Knoxville, he dressed in a black robe and sported long bushy hair and beard. In real-life, Smith would sometime have trouble getting a hotel room because of his apprarance.<ref name=Mantell/> He also carried a whistle which he used to annoy fans at ringside.<ref name=KM-4b>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp4-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #4 Page #2 |author=Webber, Steve |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nSmith and his stable continued their feud against the fan favorites of the territory. In August 1980, Smith and Bob Orton, Jr. were involved in a controversial angle when they interfered in a match between Barry O and Ronnie Garvin. As Orton distracted the referee, Smith injected Garvin with an unknown substance that made the wrestler \"foam at the mouth\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp6.htm |title=ICW ANGLES |author=Webber, Steve |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp9.htm |title=Regional Territories: ICW (Poffo) #9 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> ICW officials immediately disqualified Berry O and suspended Bob Orton, Jr. from a championship tournament to crown the first [[ICW Television Championship|ICW Television Champion]]. Orton was able to sneak into the tournament as the [[masked wrestler]] The Best but was eliminated by Bob Roop in the quarter-finals.<ref name=IPU-Titles/>\n\nIn the following weeks, Smith and Bob Orton, Jr. were hounded about the identity of The Best. On the September 6th edition of ''International Championship Wrestling'', Lanny Poffo brought out a sports bag he \"found\" to the announcers desk while Orton (with Smith in his corner) wrestled [[Pez Whatley|\"Pistol\" Pez Whatley]]. Searching the bag, he showed co-announcer John Back and the studio audience the mask and wrestling tights worn by The Best. He quickly put the items back inside and returned backstage. Smith eventually noticed the bag on the desk, unaware that Poffo had opened the bag, and began blowing his whistle at Orton. The panicked wrestler left the ring, grabbed the sports bag, and hurried with Smith back to the locker room. Orton was counted out as a result. Later on, Bob Roop confronted Smith and Orton with the bag during a TV interview. When Orton insisted the bag was not his, Roop used a knife to rip it into shreds to see Orton\u2019s reaction. To the crowd's amusement, Orton was clearly distraught as the expensive bag was destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp15-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #15  Page #2 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith and Orton showed up the following week's episode and brought out midget wrestler Mighty Cupid who claimed the $500 bag was his. In an attempt to garner sympathy with the crowd, Orton promised to take the $500 out on Roop.<ref name=IPU-TV/>\n\nOn September 20, 1980, the Devil's Duo made their ICW television debut with an impressive win over George Weingeroff and Jim Pride. The team's name was created by promoter [[Angelo Poffo]] who was part of the original Devil's Duo with Chris Markoff and manager [[Bobby Heenan]] during the 1960s. As their manager, Smith accompanied them to the ring holding a book he called the \"Kaba Kaba\" and muttering supposedly occult phrases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp3-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #3 Page #2 |author=Webber, Steve |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> These theatrical hints of mock-satanism helped to put the team over with the fans but also limited their exposure, as many other territories at that time were too 'Bible Belt' for any satanism gimmick to be used. Nevertheless, the team quickly established themselves as top contenders for the promotion's U.S. and Southeastern Tag Team titles. On April 25, 1981, Smith led the Devil's Duo to the [[ICW United States Tag Team Championship]], which they won from [[Lanny Poffo]] and George Weingeroff at [[Henry Clay High School]]. He threw a fireball to help his team win the tag team title.<ref name=IPU-Titles/> Shortly after their victory, Smith went on live TV to congratulate his team for winning the belts and bragged to the crowd about the amount of \"fan mail\" his champions had received. He also mentioned a letter from \"his cousin overseas\" and suddenly displayed a picture of [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]. This upset many in audience as the U.S. was still in the midst of the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian hostage crisis]]. Smith continued to taunt the crowd and ended by turning to the camera asking \"Oh yeah? Well, how many hostages do YOU have?\". Before the end of the show, a mob had formed outside the TV studio. The wrestlers were trapped in the building until a police escort arrived. The promotion had to arrange special security for the trio for the next several months.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\nOn May 6, Smith and the Devil's Duo entered in a $10,000 battle royal held in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]. Smith was one of the final three participants along with Jeff Sword and Ronnie Garvin. As Garvin was attempting a [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] on Sword, a masked man entered the ring, climbed to the top rope and hit Garvin with a [[lumber|2x4]]. This allowed Sword to toss Garvin out of the ring. The masked wrestler, later called The Destroyer, turned his attention towards the two remaining men. Still holding the 2x4, The Destroyer stared them down but withdrew when Doug Vines joined his teammates.<ref name=IPU-TV/><ref name=\"KM-18\"/> Smith was declared the winner of the battle royal. On his way out of the ring, Smith dropped the $10,000 check. A fan picked it up and saw it had [[Cheque#Dishonoured cheques|\"void\" written across it]]. The promotion explained this by claiming that the ring check was ceremonial and that the winner would be given the actual one within a few days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnlisterwriting.com/wrestling.html |title=Professional wrestling |author=Lister, John |date= |website=JohnListerWriting.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThat summer, Smith was attacked by fans during an ICW house show in Illinois. It was during a rematch against Poffo and Weingeroff that Smith secretly handed a chain to one of his men. The event was held in a high school gym without guardrails or security and angry fans were able to surround the manager. Poffo and Weingeroff convinced the crowd to hand Smith to them and the wrestlers quickly rushed him back to the dressing room. Smith sustained a swollen knee from the assault and believed that he would have sustained more serious injuries had his opponents not intervened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is3.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #3 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228083808/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is3.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> It was this incident that led to his decision to leave the territory.<ref name=IzzyShoot/> Smith blamed Angelo Poffo for not hiring security to work at the event which led to a verbal altercation with the promoter. Poffo ordered Smith and his team to turn over the tag team belts. He also had Slapawitz Syndicate member Barry Orton, Jr. surrender his Southeastern title. But Smith was not alone as many others had grown tired of the excessive traveling, low payoffs and poor working conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is13.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #13 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228063655/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is13.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref> The Poffo family's feud with [[Jerry Jarrett]] and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] had also alienated Smith and others who had friends in the Memphis territory. Smith and the Devil's Duo were the first of many ICW mainstays who left during the summer and fall of 1981.<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp7-2.htm |title=ICW (Poffo) #7 Page #2 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=KM-11>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp11.htm |title=Regional Territories: ICW (Poffo) #11 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith and the Devil's Duo were considered the promotion's top \"heel\" tag team at the time of their departure. Angelo Poffo later blamed Smith for the loss of talent. Despite the falling out between him and the Poffos, Smith spoke highly of the tight-knit comradery among the ICW roster.<ref name=SLAM/>\n\nThe Devil's Duo dropped the belts back to Lanny Poffo and George Weingeroff in [[Owenton, Kentucky]] on June 15, 1981.<ref name=KM-11/> Smith did not appear for the show, and all three members left the promotion shortly after this event.<ref name=IPU-Titles/> Prior to this, Randy Savage had left the Slapawitz Syndicate and had put a $2000 bounty on the manager. On the July 25th 1981 edition of ''International Championship Wrestling'', Randy Savage aired a video of he and The Destroyer \"taking out\" Slapawitz with the masked wrestler collecting the reward.<ref name=IPU-TV/><ref name=SLAM/><ref name=\"KM-18\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/icwp/icwp18.htm |title=Regional Territories: ICW (Poffo) #18 |author=Westlund, Eric |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===NWA Hollywood Wrestling===\nAs he was preparing to leave ICW, Smith got an offer from Tom Renesto who was booking for the NWA's [[Worldwide Wrestling Associates|Los Angeles territory]]. Renesto wanted him to appear for its annual battle royal at the [[Olympic Auditorium]] where he would win the [[NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=Mantell/> The Devil's Duo were also to have a title run with the [[NWA Americas Tag Team Championship]]s. Smith and his men planned to go in late 1981. The three backed out at the last minute, however, as the Knoxville territory was doing so well and were also being discouraged from wrestlers coming back from Los Angeles. NWA Hollywood Wrestling closed down the following year.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\n===Southern Championship Wrestling===\nShortly after leaving ICW, Smith joined [[Jim Crockett Promotions#1980s|Southern Championship Wrestling]] based [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Owned by [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Ric Flair]], the small promotion also had the backing of [[Jim Crockett Promotions|NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] owner [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]]. Smith contacted [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who was booking for SCW and agreed to use him albeit on the bottom of the card. Smith's first appearance was a house show in Virginia where he was a last-minute replacement for [[Archie Gouldie|The Mongolian Stomper]] in the tag team main event against Blackjack Mulligan and [[Barry Windham|Blackjack Mulligan, Jr.]]. Neither Smith or the promoters were aware that they were in an area where local wrestling fans received ICW television. The crowd immediately recognized Smith as Izzy Slapowitz and loudly booed him as he entered the ring. The strong fan reaction impressed Blackjack Mulligan and used Smith as a mid-card performer for the rest of the time in the promotion. Sullivan also remembered Smith from the Sunnyside Gardens incident ten years earlier. The wrestler no longer held a grudge towards Smith and they became good friends while in the promotion.<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is2-2.htm |title=Stories: Izzy Slapowitz #2, Page 2 |author=Smith, Jeff |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229200511/http://www.kayfabememories.com/Stories/izzyslapowitz/is2-2.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2004 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nTwo weeks after Slapawitz's debut, the Devil's Duo were brought into the territory from ICW. Many of the Virginia towns that SCW ran in, such as [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], were part of the [[Bible Belt]] and it was felt that the name might turn off fans from attending shows. The team's name was changed to \"The Hollywood Blondes\" and they were initially managed by Jimmy Holiday. Smith rejoined the Devil's Duo when Holiday left to work in the Mid-Atlantic territory. Smith held dual roles as both a manager and wrestler during this period. He mainly appeared in a \"wrestling manager\" role for Mulligan's shows in the Knoxville end of the territory and wrestled for the co-promotional shows with Crockett's side of the territory in [[Greater Richmond Region|Central Virginia area]].<ref name=IzzyShoot/> Among his opponents included Ron Wright and [[Denny Brown|Dennis Brown]], defeating the latter in bouts at the [[Salem Civic Center]] and the [[Berglund Center|Roanoke Civic Center]]. Smith also wrestled both [[Terry Taylor]] and his former trainer Rick Connors to time-limit draws on SCW television. Additionally, he accompanied Kevin Sullivan and [[Ray Candy]] as a manager.\n\n===Georgia Championship Wrestling===\nSmith was among the SCW roster Mulligan sent to [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] television tapings. In the fall of 1981, Smith made a number of appearances at [[WPCH-TV|WTBS Studios]] in [[Atlanta]]. His first GCW television appearance was a tag team match with Dave Forrester against [[George Wells (wrestler)|George Wells]] and [[Steve Olsonoski|Steve O]] on the September 12th 1981 edition of ''Georgia Championship Wrestling''.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 12, 1981 | title=NWA (1977\u20131984) DISC # 5 \u2013 1981/09/12 | url =http://wrestlingdvd.net/collection/nwa-1977-1984.html  | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=WrestlingDVD.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 12, 1981 | title=Georgia Championship Wrestling | url =http://www.savatage.com/wrest/usa/georgia.html | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=Savatage.com}}</ref> Smith teamed with [[Mike Sharpe|Iron Mike Sharpe]] against Wells and [[David Sammartino|Bruno Sammartino Jr.]] the following week.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 12, 1981 | title=NWA (1977\u20131984) DISC # 6 \u2013 1981/09/19 | url =http://wrestlingdvd.net/collection/nwa-1977-1984.html | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=WrestlingDVD.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people=Georgia Championship Wrestling (Producer) | date=September 19, 1981 | title=Georgia Championship Wrestling | url =http://www.savatage.com/wrest/usa/georgia.html | medium=DVD | location=Atlanta, Georgia | publisher=Savatage.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdrwrestling.net/2010/01/11/gcw-on-wtbs-09-19-81/ |title=GCW on WTBS (09.19.81) |author= |date=January 11, 2010 |website=PDRwrestling.net |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> In his last GCW appearance, Smith and Jose Medina lost to The Oates Brothers (Jerry Oates and Ted Oates) on the October 3rd 1981 episode of ''Georgia Championship Wrestling''.\n\n===Maple Leaf Wrestling===\nOn November 15, 1981, Smith and Doug Vines made a one-time appearance in [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] for their 50th anniversary show at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] where they lost to [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]] and [[Tony Parisi (wrestler)|Tony Parisi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mapleleafwrestling.4t.com/previousupdates/nov151981.html |title=Nov 15, 1981 \u2013 50th Anniversary |author=Calvert, Andrew |date= |website=MapleLeafWrestling.com |publisher=Maple Leaf Wrestling \u2013 Pictorial |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008215055/http://mapleleafwrestling.4t.com/previousupdates/nov151981.html |archivedate=October 8, 2015 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/mapleleaf/mapleleaf5-2.htm |title=Maple Leaf #5 Page #2 |author=Calvert, Andrew |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Smith had been sent to Canada by Mulligan for a one-time appearance.

Smith announced to the crowd that they were wrestling each other to show the audience how tough they were and vowed that \"blood would be spilled\".

When the three men returned to Knoxville the following day, they told Mulligan what had happened and the promoter drove to Charlotte where he confronted Anderson in the dressing room. Smith later speculated that their problems with Ole Anderson may have stemmed from real-life animosity between the two.<ref name=IzzyShoot/>\n\nThe Devil's Duo remained the top \"heel\" tag team in SCW even after Crockett took full control of the Knoxville territory. The trio continued to have difficulty with Ole Anderson who cancelled many of their shows scheduled by assistant booker [[Johnny Weaver]] in early 1982. Smith decided to quit when all of his bookings were suddenly dropped except for a single show in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. The last-ever appearance of Slapawitz and Devil's Duo was supposed to be a six-man tag team match in Knoxville against [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Jimmy Valiant]] and Johnny Weaver. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] had taken over as booker shortly afterwards. Smith had a very good relationship with Rhodes who expressed interest in using the Devil's Duo. Jeff Sword had lost interest in pro wrestling by this time and, after a brief stint as [[The Assassins (professional wrestling)|Assassin #2]], left the business.<ref name=IzzyShoot/><ref name=Mantell/>\n\n===Later career===\nWhile Doug Vines stayed with JCP, Smith chose not to return to JCP. He began scaling back his wrestling schedule during the mid-to-late 1980s. His last major run was working for Bill Needham's All Star Championship Wrestling in northeastern Tennessee.<ref name=KM-4b/> One of his most memorable moments in the promotion was when he faked a heart attack during a bare knuckles match against Rick Conner in 1990. It was also in ASCW that Smith was reunited with The Devil's Duo. The team won the ASCW Tag Team Championship twice and Doug Vines won the ASCW Heavyweight Championship five times.<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|edition=4th |year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> On January 8, 1991, he made a brief appearance on ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' taping against [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] at [[UTC Arena]] in Chattanooga.<ref name=SLAM/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=1991 |author=Cawthon, Graham |date= |website=TheHistoryofWWE.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nSmith went into retirement after the close of ASCW in 1992. He returned to New York and worked as an insurance salesman until the mid-2000s due to health problems. In 2007, Smith underwent emergency ascending [[aortic dissection]] surgery. The lengthy recovery period and blood pressure medication he was put on prevented him from working as a sales rep. Smith was still receiving cardiac therapy for his heart four years after his surgery.

It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the \"'''Blue Route'''\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the [[Toll road|tolled]], {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a 4 mile long, 4-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.  This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places.  This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system.  The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem.  With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|I-369]] in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\n<!--\nWhile proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1992 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history.\" In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its \"Blue Route\" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]]), but it may someday be surpassed in length by [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|Interstate 369]] in [[Texas]]. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]], [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland, and [[Interstate 2]] in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs. -->\n==Route description==\n\n===Blue Route===\n[[File:I-476 north of US 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Blue Route north of US 1.]]\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Interstate 276]] runs north\u2013south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\".

It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the \"'''Blue Route'''\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the [[Toll road|tolled]], {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a 4 mile long, 4-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.  This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places.  This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system.  The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem.  With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|I-369]] in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\n<!--\nWhile proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1992 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history.\" In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its \"Blue Route\" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]]), but it may someday be surpassed in length by [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|Interstate 369]] in [[Texas]]. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]], [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland, and [[Interstate 2]] in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs. -->\n==Route description==\n\n===Blue Route===\n[[File:I-476 north of US 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Blue Route north of US 1.]]\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Interstate 276]] runs north\u2013south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\".
