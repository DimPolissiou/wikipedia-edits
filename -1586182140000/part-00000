Large-scale terrestrial impacts of the sort that produced the [[Barringer Crater]], locally known as [[Meteor Crater]], northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona, are rare. Instead, it was widely thought that cratering was the result of [[volcanism]]: the Barringer Crater, for example, was ascribed to a prehistoric volcanic explosion (not an unreasonable hypothesis, given that the volcanic [[San Francisco Peaks]] stand only {{convert|30|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}} to the west). Similarly, the craters on the surface of the Moon were ascribed to volcanism.\n\nIt was not until 1903\u20131905 that the Barringer Crater was correctly identified as an [[impact crater]], and it was not until as recently as 1963 that research by [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker]] conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century [[space exploration]] and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and there was no reason to believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]].\n\nBased on crater formation rates determined from the Earth's closest celestial partner, the [[Moon]], [[astrogeology|astrogeologists]] have determined that during the last 600 million years, the [[Earth]] has been struck by 60 objects of a diameter of {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} or more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The smallest of these impactors would leave a crater almost {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} across.

Further, the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the K-T boundary are similar to the chromium isotopic ratios found in [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid, but a comet is also possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites.\n\nProbably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named [[Chicxulub Crater]]. This crater is centered on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico and was discovered by Tony Camargo and Glen Pentfield while working as [[geophysicist]]s for the Mexican oil company [[PEMEX]]. What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be {{convert|180|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} in diameter. This convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extraterrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).\n\nAlthough there is now general agreement that there was a huge impact at the end of the Cretaceous that led to the iridium enrichment of the K-T boundary layer, remnants have been found of other, smaller impacts, some nearing half the size of the Chicxulub crater, which did not result in any mass extinctions, and there is no clear linkage between an impact and any other incident of mass extinction.<ref name=\"Keller\">{{cite journal | url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/earth-sci/083f/kellerkt.pdf | title=Impacts, volcanism and mass extinction: random coincidence or cause and effect? | author=Keller G. | journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences | date=2005 | volume=52 | issue=4\u20135 | pages=725\u2013757 | doi=10.1080/08120090500170393|bibcode = 2005AuJES..52..725K }}</ref>\n\nPaleontologists [[David M.

Further observations with ATLAS extended the observation arc from 1 hour to 4 hours and confirmed that the asteroid orbit indeed impacted Earth in southern Africa, fully closing the loop with the fireball report and making this the third natural object confirmed to impact Earth, and the second on land after {{mp|2008 TC|3}}.<ref name=\"orientation\">{{cite journal \n|last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=Carlos \n|last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Ra\u00fal \n|date=18 June 2018 \n|title=On the Pre-impact Orbital Evolution of 2018 LA, Parent Body of the Bright Fireball Observed Over Botswana on 2018 June 2 \n|journal=[[Research Notes of the AAS]] \n|volume=2 \n|issue=2 \n|pages=57 \n|arxiv=1806.05164 \n|bibcode=2018RNAAS...2b..57D \n|doi=10.3847/2515-5172/aacc71}}</ref><ref name=\"pre-impact2\">{{cite journal \n|last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=Carlos \n|last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Ra\u00fal \n|date=26 July 2018 \n|title=Pre-airburst Orbital Evolution of Earth's Impactor 2018 LA: An Update \n|journal=[[Research Notes of the AAS]] \n|volume=2 \n|issue=3 \n|pages=131 \n|arxiv=1807.08322 \n|bibcode=2018RNAAS...2c.131D \n|doi=10.3847/2515-5172/aad551}}</ref><ref name=\"excess\">{{cite journal |last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=C. |last2=de la Fuente Marcos | first2= R.|title=Waiting to make an impact: A probable excess of near-Earth asteroids in 2018 LA-like orbits |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume= 621|pages= A137|date=2019 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201834313\n |arxiv=1811.11845 |bibcode=2019A&A...621A.137D }}</ref>\n\nOn 8 March 2019, [[NASA]] announced the detection of a large airburst that occurred on 18 December 2018 at 11:48 local time off the eastern coast of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. The [[Kamchatka superbolide]] is estimated to have had a mass of roughly 1600 tons, and a diameter of 9 to 14 meters depending on its density, making it the third largest asteroid to impact Earth since 1900, after the Chelyabinsk meteor and the Tunguska event.

The diagram was constructed afterwards for illustration.]]\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century scientists put in place measures to detect [[Near Earth object]]s, and predict the dates and times of [[asteroids]] impacting Earth, along with the locations at which they will impact. The [[International Astronomical Union]] [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) is the global clearing house for information on asteroid orbits. [[NASA]]'s [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry System]] continually scans the MPC catalog of known asteroids, analyzing their orbits for any possible future impacts.<ref>{{YouTube|id=53Js-_vo3mo|title=How Does NASA Spot a Near-Earth Asteroid?}}</ref> Currently none are predicted (the single highest probability impact currently listed is ~7 m asteroid {{mpl|2010 RF|12}}, which is due to pass earth in September 2095 with only a 5% predicted chance of impacting).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentry: Earth Impact Monitoring|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/|website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nCurrently prediction is mainly based on cataloging [[asteroids]] years before they are due to impact. This works well for larger asteroids (> 1 [[kilometre|km]] across) as they are easily seen from a long distance. Over 95% of them are already known and their [[orbit]]s have been measured, so any future impacts can be predicted long before they are on their final approach to [[Earth]]. Smaller objects are too faint to observe except when they come very close and so most cannot be observed before their final approach. Current mechanisms for detecting asteroids on final approach rely on wide-field ground based [[telescopes]], such as the [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System|ATLAS]] system. However, current telescopes only cover part of the Earth and even more importantly cannot detect asteroids on the day-side of the planet, which is why so few of the smaller asteroids that commonly impact Earth are detected during the few hours that they would be visible.<ref name=\"JPL-2017-SDT-Update\">{{cite news\n  |title      = Update to Determine the Feasibility of Enhancing the Search and Characterization of NEOs \n  |work       = Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team Report 2017\n  |publisher  = NASA\n  |url        = https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2017_neo_sdt_final_e-version.pdf\n  |accessdate = 7 July 2018}}</ref>\nSo far only four impact events have been successfully predicted in advance, all from innocuous 2-5m diameter asteroids and detected a few hours in advance. \n  \n{{wide image|SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg|500px|align-cap=center|Ground based telescopes can only detect objects approaching on the night-side of the planet, away from the [[Sun]].

Without carbon dating, other points of reference are used to estimate the timing of these impact events. Mars provides some significant evidence of possible interplanetary collisions. The [[North Polar Basin (Mars)|North Polar Basin]] on Mars is speculated by some to be evidence for a planet-sized impact on the surface of Mars between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago, while [[Utopia Planitia]] is the largest confirmed impact and [[Hellas Planitia]] is the largest visible crater in the Solar System. The Moon provides similar evidence of massive impacts, with the [[South Pole\u2013Aitken basin]] being the biggest.

Large-scale terrestrial impacts of the sort that produced the [[Barringer Crater]], locally known as [[Meteor Crater]], northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona, are rare. Instead, it was widely thought that cratering was the result of [[volcanism]]: the Barringer Crater, for example, was ascribed to a prehistoric volcanic explosion (not an unreasonable hypothesis, given that the volcanic [[San Francisco Peaks]] stand only {{convert|30|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}} to the west). Similarly, the craters on the surface of the Moon were ascribed to volcanism.\n\nIt was not until 1903\u20131905 that the Barringer Crater was correctly identified as an [[impact crater]], and it was not until as recently as 1963 that research by [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker]] conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century [[space exploration]] and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and there was no reason to believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]].\n\nBased on crater formation rates determined from the Earth's closest celestial partner, the [[Moon]], [[astrogeology|astrogeologists]] have determined that during the last 600 million years, the [[Earth]] has been struck by 60 objects of a diameter of {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} or more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The smallest of these impactors would leave a crater almost {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} across.

Further, the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the K-T boundary are similar to the chromium isotopic ratios found in [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid, but a comet is also possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites.\n\nProbably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named [[Chicxulub Crater]]. This crater is centered on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico and was discovered by Tony Camargo and Glen Pentfield while working as [[geophysicist]]s for the Mexican oil company [[PEMEX]]. What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be {{convert|180|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} in diameter. This convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extraterrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).\n\nAlthough there is now general agreement that there was a huge impact at the end of the Cretaceous that led to the iridium enrichment of the K-T boundary layer, remnants have been found of other, smaller impacts, some nearing half the size of the Chicxulub crater, which did not result in any mass extinctions, and there is no clear linkage between an impact and any other incident of mass extinction.<ref name=\"Keller\">{{cite journal | url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/earth-sci/083f/kellerkt.pdf | title=Impacts, volcanism and mass extinction: random coincidence or cause and effect? | author=Keller G. | journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences | date=2005 | volume=52 | issue=4\u20135 | pages=725\u2013757 | doi=10.1080/08120090500170393|bibcode = 2005AuJES..52..725K }}</ref>\n\nPaleontologists [[David M.

Further observations with ATLAS extended the observation arc from 1 hour to 4 hours and confirmed that the asteroid orbit indeed impacted Earth in southern Africa, fully closing the loop with the fireball report and making this the third natural object confirmed to impact Earth, and the second on land after {{mp|2008 TC|3}}.<ref name=\"orientation\">{{cite journal \n|last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=Carlos \n|last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Ra\u00fal \n|date=18 June 2018 \n|title=On the Pre-impact Orbital Evolution of 2018 LA, Parent Body of the Bright Fireball Observed Over Botswana on 2018 June 2 \n|journal=[[Research Notes of the AAS]] \n|volume=2 \n|issue=2 \n|pages=57 \n|arxiv=1806.05164 \n|bibcode=2018RNAAS...2b..57D \n|doi=10.3847/2515-5172/aacc71}}</ref><ref name=\"pre-impact2\">{{cite journal \n|last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=Carlos \n|last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Ra\u00fal \n|date=26 July 2018 \n|title=Pre-airburst Orbital Evolution of Earth's Impactor 2018 LA: An Update \n|journal=[[Research Notes of the AAS]] \n|volume=2 \n|issue=3 \n|pages=131 \n|arxiv=1807.08322 \n|bibcode=2018RNAAS...2c.131D \n|doi=10.3847/2515-5172/aad551}}</ref><ref name=\"excess\">{{cite journal |last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=C. |last2=de la Fuente Marcos | first2= R.|title=Waiting to make an impact: A probable excess of near-Earth asteroids in 2018 LA-like orbits |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume= 621|pages= A137|date=2019 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201834313\n |arxiv=1811.11845 |bibcode=2019A&A...621A.137D }}</ref>\n\nOn 8 March 2019, [[NASA]] announced the detection of a large airburst that occurred on 18 December 2018 at 11:48 local time off the eastern coast of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. The [[Kamchatka superbolide]] is estimated to have had a mass of roughly 1600 tons, and a diameter of 9 to 14 meters depending on its density, making it the third largest asteroid to impact Earth since 1900, after the Chelyabinsk meteor and the Tunguska event.

The diagram was constructed afterwards for illustration.]]\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century scientists put in place measures to detect [[Near Earth object]]s, and predict the dates and times of [[asteroids]] impacting Earth, along with the locations at which they will impact. The [[International Astronomical Union]] [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) is the global clearing house for information on asteroid orbits. [[NASA]]'s [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry System]] continually scans the MPC catalog of known asteroids, analyzing their orbits for any possible future impacts.<ref>{{YouTube|id=53Js-_vo3mo|title=How Does NASA Spot a Near-Earth Asteroid?}}</ref> Currently none are predicted (the single highest probability impact currently listed is ~7 m asteroid {{mpl|2010 RF|12}}, which is due to pass earth in September 2095 with only a 5% predicted chance of impacting).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentry: Earth Impact Monitoring|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/|website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nCurrently prediction is mainly based on cataloging [[asteroids]] years before they are due to impact. This works well for larger asteroids (> 1 [[kilometre|km]] across) as they are easily seen from a long distance. Over 95% of them are already known and their [[orbit]]s have been measured, so any future impacts can be predicted long before they are on their final approach to [[Earth]]. Smaller objects are too faint to observe except when they come very close and so most cannot be observed before their final approach. Current mechanisms for detecting asteroids on final approach rely on wide-field ground based [[telescopes]], such as the [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System|ATLAS]] system. However, current telescopes only cover part of the Earth and even more importantly cannot detect asteroids on the day-side of the planet, which is why so few of the smaller asteroids that commonly impact Earth are detected during the few hours that they would be visible.<ref name=\"JPL-2017-SDT-Update\">{{cite news\n  |title      = Update to Determine the Feasibility of Enhancing the Search and Characterization of NEOs \n  |work       = Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team Report 2017\n  |publisher  = NASA\n  |url        = https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2017_neo_sdt_final_e-version.pdf\n  |accessdate = 7 July 2018}}</ref>\nSo far only four impact events have been successfully predicted in advance, all from innocuous 2-5m diameter asteroids and detected a few hours in advance. \n  \n{{wide image|SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg|500px|align-cap=center|Ground based telescopes can only detect objects approaching on the night-side of the planet, away from the [[Sun]].

Without carbon dating, other points of reference are used to estimate the timing of these impact events. Mars provides some significant evidence of possible interplanetary collisions. The [[North Polar Basin (Mars)|North Polar Basin]] on Mars is speculated by some to be evidence for a planet-sized impact on the surface of Mars between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago, while [[Utopia Planitia]] is the largest confirmed impact and [[Hellas Planitia]] is the largest visible crater in the Solar System. The Moon provides similar evidence of massive impacts, with the [[South Pole\u2013Aitken basin]] being the biggest.

In the [[quark model]] they are understood to be [[bound states]] of a [[strange quark]] (or antiquark) and an [[up quark|up]] or [[down quark|down]] antiquark (or quark).\n\nKaons have proved to be a copious source of information on the nature of [[fundamental interactions]] since their discovery in [[cosmic ray]]s in 1947. They were essential in establishing the foundations of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, such as the [[quark model]] of [[hadron]]s and the theory of [[Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix|quark mixing]] (the latter was acknowledged by a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2008). Kaons have played a distinguished role in our understanding of fundamental [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s: [[CP violation]], a phenomenon generating the observed matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry of the universe, was discovered in the kaon system in 1964 (which was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in 1980). Moreover, direct CP violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the [[NA48 experiment]] at [[CERN]] and the KTeV experiment at [[Fermilab]].\n\n==Basic properties==\nThe four kaons are :\n#{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon-}}, negatively charged (containing a [[strange quark]] and an [[up quark|up antiquark]]) has mass {{val|493.677|0.013|u=MeV}} and [[mean lifetime]] {{val|1.2380|0.0020|e=-8|u=s}}.\n#{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon+}} ([[antiparticle]] of above) positively charged (containing an [[up quark]] and a [[Strange quark|strange antiquark]]) must  (by [[CPT invariance]]) have mass and lifetime equal to that of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon-}}. Experimentally, the mass difference is {{val|0.032|0.090|u=MeV}}, consistent with zero; the difference in lifetimes is {{val|0.11|0.09|e=-8|u=s}}, also consistent with zero.\n#{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}}, neutrally charged (containing a [[down quark]] and a [[strange quark|strange antiquark]]) has mass {{val|497.648|0.022|u=MeV}}. It has mean squared [[charge radius]] of {{val|-0.076|0.01|ul=fm2}}.\n#{{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}}, neutrally charged (antiparticle of above) (containing a [[strange quark]] and a [[down quark|down antiquark]]) has the same mass.\n\nAs the [[quark model]] shows, assignments that the kaons form two doublets of [[isospin]]; that is, they belong to the [[fundamental representation]] of [[SU(2)]] called the '''2'''. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon+}} and the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}}. The antiparticles form the other doublet (of strangeness &minus;1).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Properties of kaons\n|-\n! class=unsortable|Particle name\n!

The estimated mass of the new particles was very rough, about half a proton's mass. More examples of these \"V-particles\" were slow in coming.\n\nThe first breakthrough was obtained at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], where a cloud chamber was taken up [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], for greater cosmic ray exposure. In 1950, 30 charged and 4 neutral V-particles were reported. Inspired by this, numerous mountaintop observations were made over the next several years, and by 1953, the following terminology was adopted: \"L-meson\" meant [[muon]] or [[pion]]. \"K meson\" meant a particle intermediate in mass between the pion and [[nucleon]]. \"[[Hyperon]]\" meant any particle heavier than a nucleon.\n\nThe decays were extremely slow; typical lifetimes are of the order of {{val|e=-10|u=seconds}}. However, production in [[pion]]-[[proton]] reactions proceeds much faster, with a time scale of {{val|e=-23|u=s}}. The problem of this mismatch was solved by [[Abraham Pais]] who postulated the new quantum number called \"[[Strangeness (particle physics)|strangeness]]\" which is conserved in [[strong interaction]]s but violated by the [[weak interaction]]s. Strange particles appear copiously due to \"associated production\" of a strange and an antistrange particle together. It was soon shown that this could not be a [[multiplicative quantum number]], because that would allow reactions which were never seen in the new [[synchrotron]]s which were commissioned in [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in 1953 and in the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] in 1955.\n\n==Parity violation==\nTwo different decays were found for charged strange mesons:\n:{| border=0\n|- style=\"height: 2em;\"\n| {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}    || \u2192 || {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\n|- style=\"height: 2em;\"\n| {{SubatomicParticle|Antitauon}} || \u2192 || {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion-}}\n|}\nThe intrinsic parity of a pion is P&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121, and parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Therefore, the two final states have different [[parity (physics)|parity]] (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1 and P&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121, respectively). It was thought that the initial states should also have different parities, and hence be two distinct particles. However, with increasingly precise measurements, no difference was found between the masses and lifetimes of each, respectively, indicating that they are the same particle. This was known as the '''\u03c4\u2013\u03b8 puzzle'''. It was resolved only by the discovery of [[parity (physics)#Parity violation|parity violation]] in [[weak interaction]]s. Since the mesons decay through weak interactions, parity is not conserved, and the two decays are actually decays of the same particle,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=T.

In order to understand the discovery of [[CP violation]], it is necessary to understand the mixing of neutral kaons; this phenomenon does not require CP violation, but it is the context in which CP violation was first observed.\n\n===Neutral kaon mixing===\n<!--This section is redirected to from [[Neutral kaon mixing]].-->\n[[File:Kaon-box-diagram-with-bar.svg|thumb|Two different neutral K mesons, carrying different strangeness, can turn from one into another through the [[weak interaction]]s, since these interactions do not conserve strangeness. The strange quark in the anti-{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} turns into a down quark by successively absorbing two [[W-boson]]s of opposite charge. The down antiquark in the anti-{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} turns into a strange antiquark by emitting them.]]\n\nSince neutral kaons carry strangeness, they cannot be their own antiparticles. There must be then two different neutral kaons, differing by two units of strangeness. The question was then how to establish the presence of these two mesons. The solution used a phenomenon called '''[[neutral particle oscillations]]''', by which these two kinds of mesons can turn from one into another through the weak interactions, which cause them to decay into pions (see the adjacent figure).\n\nThese oscillations were first investigated by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Abraham Pais]] together. They considered the CP-invariant time evolution of states with opposite strangeness. In matrix notation one can write\n::<math> \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi(0) = {\\rm e}^{iHt} \\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad H =\\begin{pmatrix}M & \\Delta\\\\ \\Delta & M\\end{pmatrix} ,</math>\nwhere ''\u03c8'' is a [[quantum state]] of the system specified by the amplitudes of being in each of the two [[quantum mechanics#Basis states|basis states]] (which are ''a'' and ''b'' at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0). The diagonal elements (''M'') of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] are due to [[strong interaction]] physics which conserves strangeness. The two diagonal elements must be equal, since the particle and antiparticle have equal masses in the absence of the weak interactions. The off-diagonal elements, which mix opposite strangeness particles, are due to [[weak interactions]]; [[CP symmetry]] requires them to be real.\n\nThe consequence of the matrix ''H'' being real is that the probabilities of the two states will forever oscillate back and forth. However, if any part of the matrix were imaginary, as is forbidden by [[CP symmetry]], then part of the combination will diminish over time. The diminishing part can be either one component (''a'') or the other (''b''), or a mixture of the two.\n\n====Mixing====\nThe eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, which we can call '''K<sub>1</sub>''' which is the sum of the two states of opposite strangeness, and '''K<sub>2</sub>''', which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of '''CP''' with opposite eigenvalues; '''K<sub>1</sub>''' has '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, and '''K<sub>2</sub>''' has '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121 Since the two-pion final state also has '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, only the '''K<sub>1</sub>''' can decay this way. The '''K<sub>2</sub>''' must decay into three pions. Since the mass of '''K<sub>2</sub>''' is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of '''K<sub>1</sub>''' into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by [[Leon Lederman]] and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two [[weak interaction|weak]] [[eigenstate]]s (states with definite [[mean lifetime|lifetimes]] under decays via the [[weak force]]) of the neutral kaons.\n\nThese two weak eigenstates are called the {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} (K-long) and {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} (K-short).  [[CP symmetry]], which was assumed at the time, implies that {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K<sub>1</sub>''' and {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K<sub>2</sub>'''.\n\n====Oscillation====\n{{Main article|Neutral particle oscillation}}\nAn initially pure beam of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} will turn into its antiparticle while propagating, which will turn back into the original particle, and so on. This is called particle oscillation. On observing the weak decay ''into leptons'', it was found that a {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} always decayed into an positron, whereas the antiparticle {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}} decayed into the electron. The earlier analysis yielded a relation between the rate of electron and positron production from sources of pure {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and its antiparticle {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}}. Analysis of the time dependence of this [[semileptonic decay]] showed the phenomenon of oscillation, and allowed the extraction of the mass splitting between the {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} and {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}}. Since this is due to weak interactions it is very small, 10<sup>\u221215</sup> times the mass of each state.\n\n====Regeneration====\nA beam of neutral kaons decays in flight so that the short-lived {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} disappears, leaving a beam of pure long-lived {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}}. If this beam is shot into matter, then the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and its antiparticle {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}} interact differently with the nuclei. The {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} undergoes quasi-[[elastic scattering]] with [[nucleon]]s, whereas its antiparticle can create [[hyperon]]s. Due to the different interactions of the two components, [[quantum coherence]] between the two particles is lost. The emerging beam then contains different linear superpositions of the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}}. Such a superposition is a mixture of {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} and {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}}; the {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} is regenerated by passing a neutral kaon beam through matter. Regeneration was observed by [[Oreste Piccioni]] and his collaborators at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. Soon thereafter, Robert Adair and his coworkers reported excess {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} regeneration, thus opening a new chapter in this history.\n\n===CP violation===\nWhile trying to verify Adair's results, J. Christenson, [[James Cronin]], [[Val Fitch]] and [[Rene Turlay]] of [[Princeton University]] found decays of {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} into two pions ('''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1)\nin an [[Fitch-Cronin experiment|experiment performed in 1964]] at the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven laboratory]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evidence for the 2\u03c0 Decay of the K<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup> Meson|first1=J.

Alternative explanations such as nonlinear quantum mechanics and a new unobserved particle were soon ruled out, leaving CP violation as the only possibility. Cronin and Fitch received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery in 1980.\n\nIt turns out that although the {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} and {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} are [[weak interaction|weak]] [[eigenstates]] (because they have definite [[mean lifetime|lifetimes]] for decay by way of the weak force), they are ''not quite'' '''CP''' eigenstates. Instead, for small \u03b5 (and up to normalization),\n\n:{{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} = '''K<sub>2</sub>''' + \u03b5'''K<sub>1</sub>'''\n\nand similarly for {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}}. Thus occasionally the {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} decays as a '''K<sub>1</sub>''' with '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, and likewise the {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} can decay with '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121. This is known as '''indirect CP violation''', CP violation due to mixing of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and its antiparticle. There is also a '''direct CP violation''' effect, in which the CP violation occurs during the decay itself. Both are present, because both mixing and decay arise from the same interaction with the [[W boson]] and thus have CP violation predicted by the [[CKM matrix]]. Direct CP violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the [[NA48]] and [[KTeV]] experiments at CERN and Fermilab.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|kaon}}\n*[[Hadron]]s, [[meson]]s, [[hyperon]]s and [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]\n*[[Strange quark]] and the [[quark model]]\n*[[Parity (physics)]], [[charge conjugation]], [[T-symmetry|time reversal symmetry]], [[CPT invariance]] and [[CP violation]]\n*[[Neutrino oscillation]]\n* [[Neutral particle oscillation]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Amsler |first1=C. |last2=Doser |first2=M. |last3=Antonelli |first3=M. |last4=Asner |first4=D. |last5=Babu |first5=K. |last6=Baer |first6=H. |last7=Band |first7=H. |last8=Barnett |first8=R. |last9=Bergren |first9=E. |last10=Bergren |first10=E. |last11=Beringer |first11=J. |last12=Bernardi |first12=G. |last13=Bertl |first13=W. |last14=Bichsel |first14=H. |last15=Biebel |first15=O. |last16=Bloch |first16=P. |last17=Blucher |first17=E. |last18=Blusk |first18=S. |last19=Cahn |first19=R.N. |last20=Carena |first20=M. |last21=Caso |first21=C. |last22=Ceccucci |first22=A. |last23=Chakraborty |first23=D. |last24=Chen |first24=M.-C. |last25=Chivukula |first25=R.S. |last26=Cowan |first26=G. |last27=Dahl |first27=O. |last28=d'Ambrosio |first28=G. |last29=Damour |first29=T. |last30=de Gouv\u00eaa |first30=A. |displayauthors=6 |collaboration=[[Particle Data Group]] |year=2008 |title=Review of Particle Physics |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=667 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20131340 |bibcode=2008PhLB..667....1A |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.07.018|url=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/11249/2/scalarsV.pdf }}\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Eidelman |first1=S. |last2=Hayes |first2=K.G. |last3=Olive |first3=K.A. |last4=Aguilar-Benitez |first4=M. |last5=Amsler |first5=C. |last6=Asner |first6=D. |last7=Babu |first7=K.S. |last8=Barnett |first8=R.M. |last9=Beringer |first9=J. |last10=Burchat |first10=P.R. |last11=Carone |first11=C.D. |last12=Caso |first12=S. |last13=Conforto |first13=G. |last14=Dahl |first14=O. |last15=d'Ambrosio |first15=G. |last16=Doser |first16=M. |last17=Feng |first17=J.

In the [[quark model]] they are understood to be [[bound states]] of a [[strange quark]] (or antiquark) and an [[up quark|up]] or [[down quark|down]] antiquark (or quark).\n\nKaons have proved to be a copious source of information on the nature of [[fundamental interactions]] since their discovery in [[cosmic ray]]s in 1947. They were essential in establishing the foundations of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, such as the [[quark model]] of [[hadron]]s and the theory of [[Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix|quark mixing]] (the latter was acknowledged by a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2008). Kaons have played a distinguished role in our understanding of fundamental [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s: [[CP violation]], a phenomenon generating the observed matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry of the universe, was discovered in the kaon system in 1964 (which was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in 1980). Moreover, direct CP violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the [[NA48 experiment]] at [[CERN]] and the KTeV experiment at [[Fermilab]].\n\n==Basic properties==\nThe four kaons are :\n#{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon-}}, negatively charged (containing a [[strange quark]] and an [[up quark|up antiquark]]) has mass {{val|493.677|0.013|u=MeV}} and [[mean lifetime]] {{val|1.2380|0.0020|e=-8|u=s}}.\n#{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon+}} ([[antiparticle]] of above) positively charged (containing an [[up quark]] and a [[Strange quark|strange antiquark]]) must  (by [[CPT invariance]]) have mass and lifetime equal to that of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon-}}. Experimentally, the mass difference is {{val|0.032|0.090|u=MeV}}, consistent with zero; the difference in lifetimes is {{val|0.11|0.09|e=-8|u=s}}, also consistent with zero.\n#{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}}, neutrally charged (containing a [[down quark]] and a [[strange quark|strange antiquark]]) has mass {{val|497.648|0.022|u=MeV}}. It has mean squared [[charge radius]] of {{val|-0.076|0.01|ul=fm2}}.\n#{{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}}, neutrally charged (antiparticle of above) (containing a [[strange quark]] and a [[down quark|down antiquark]]) has the same mass.\n\nAs the [[quark model]] shows, assignments that the kaons form two doublets of [[isospin]]; that is, they belong to the [[fundamental representation]] of [[SU(2)]] called the '''2'''. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon+}} and the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}}. The antiparticles form the other doublet (of strangeness &minus;1).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Properties of kaons\n|-\n! class=unsortable|Particle name\n!

D. Rochester]] and [[Clifford Charles Butler]] of the [[University of Manchester]] published two [[cloud chamber]] photographs of [[cosmic ray]]-induced events, one showing what appeared to be a neutral particle decaying into two charged pions, and one which appeared to be a charged particle decaying into a charged pion and something neutral. The estimated mass of the new particles was very rough, about half a proton's mass. More examples of these \"V-particles\" were slow in coming.\n\nThe first breakthrough was obtained at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], where a cloud chamber was taken up [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], for greater cosmic ray exposure. In 1950, 30 charged and 4 neutral V-particles were reported. Inspired by this, numerous mountaintop observations were made over the next several years, and by 1953, the following terminology was adopted: \"L-meson\" meant [[muon]] or [[pion]]. \"K meson\" meant a particle intermediate in mass between the pion and [[nucleon]]. \"[[Hyperon]]\" meant any particle heavier than a nucleon.\n\nThe decays were extremely slow; typical lifetimes are of the order of {{val|e=-10|u=seconds}}. However, production in [[pion]]-[[proton]] reactions proceeds much faster, with a time scale of {{val|e=-23|u=s}}. The problem of this mismatch was solved by [[Abraham Pais]] who postulated the new quantum number called \"[[Strangeness (particle physics)|strangeness]]\" which is conserved in [[strong interaction]]s but violated by the [[weak interaction]]s. Strange particles appear copiously due to \"associated production\" of a strange and an antistrange particle together. It was soon shown that this could not be a [[multiplicative quantum number]], because that would allow reactions which were never seen in the new [[synchrotron]]s which were commissioned in [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in 1953 and in the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] in 1955.\n\n==Parity violation==\nTwo different decays were found for charged strange mesons:\n:{| border=0\n|- style=\"height: 2em;\"\n| {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}    || \u2192 || {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\n|- style=\"height: 2em;\"\n| {{SubatomicParticle|Antitauon}} || \u2192 || {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion-}}\n|}\nThe intrinsic parity of a pion is P&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121, and parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Therefore, the two final states have different [[parity (physics)|parity]] (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1 and P&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121, respectively). It was thought that the initial states should also have different parities, and hence be two distinct particles. However, with increasingly precise measurements, no difference was found between the masses and lifetimes of each, respectively, indicating that they are the same particle. This was known as the '''\u03c4\u2013\u03b8 puzzle'''. It was resolved only by the discovery of [[parity (physics)#Parity violation|parity violation]] in [[weak interaction]]s. Since the mesons decay through weak interactions, parity is not conserved, and the two decays are actually decays of the same particle,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=T.

In order to understand the discovery of [[CP violation]], it is necessary to understand the mixing of neutral kaons; this phenomenon does not require CP violation, but it is the context in which CP violation was first observed.\n\n===Neutral kaon mixing===\n<!--This section is redirected to from [[Neutral kaon mixing]].-->\n[[File:Kaon-box-diagram-with-bar.svg|thumb|Two different neutral K mesons, carrying different strangeness, can turn from one into another through the [[weak interaction]]s, since these interactions do not conserve strangeness. The strange quark in the anti-{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} turns into a down quark by successively absorbing two [[W-boson]]s of opposite charge. The down antiquark in the anti-{{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} turns into a strange antiquark by emitting them.]]\n\nSince neutral kaons carry strangeness, they cannot be their own antiparticles. There must be then two different neutral kaons, differing by two units of strangeness. The question was then how to establish the presence of these two mesons. The solution used a phenomenon called '''[[neutral particle oscillations]]''', by which these two kinds of mesons can turn from one into another through the weak interactions, which cause them to decay into pions (see the adjacent figure).\n\nThese oscillations were first investigated by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Abraham Pais]] together. They considered the CP-invariant time evolution of states with opposite strangeness. In matrix notation one can write\n::<math> \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi(0) = {\\rm e}^{iHt} \\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad H =\\begin{pmatrix}M & \\Delta\\\\ \\Delta & M\\end{pmatrix} ,</math>\nwhere ''\u03c8'' is a [[quantum state]] of the system specified by the amplitudes of being in each of the two [[quantum mechanics#Basis states|basis states]] (which are ''a'' and ''b'' at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0). The diagonal elements (''M'') of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] are due to [[strong interaction]] physics which conserves strangeness. The two diagonal elements must be equal, since the particle and antiparticle have equal masses in the absence of the weak interactions. The off-diagonal elements, which mix opposite strangeness particles, are due to [[weak interactions]]; [[CP symmetry]] requires them to be real.\n\nThe consequence of the matrix ''H'' being real is that the probabilities of the two states will forever oscillate back and forth. However, if any part of the matrix were imaginary, as is forbidden by [[CP symmetry]], then part of the combination will diminish over time. The diminishing part can be either one component (''a'') or the other (''b''), or a mixture of the two.\n\n====Mixing====\nThe eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, which we can call '''K<sub>1</sub>''' which is the sum of the two states of opposite strangeness, and '''K<sub>2</sub>''', which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of '''CP''' with opposite eigenvalues; '''K<sub>1</sub>''' has '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, and '''K<sub>2</sub>''' has '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121 Since the two-pion final state also has '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, only the '''K<sub>1</sub>''' can decay this way. The '''K<sub>2</sub>''' must decay into three pions. Since the mass of '''K<sub>2</sub>''' is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of '''K<sub>1</sub>''' into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by [[Leon Lederman]] and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two [[weak interaction|weak]] [[eigenstate]]s (states with definite [[mean lifetime|lifetimes]] under decays via the [[weak force]]) of the neutral kaons.\n\nThese two weak eigenstates are called the {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} (K-long) and {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} (K-short).  [[CP symmetry]], which was assumed at the time, implies that {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K<sub>1</sub>''' and {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K<sub>2</sub>'''.\n\n====Oscillation====\n{{Main article|Neutral particle oscillation}}\nAn initially pure beam of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} will turn into its antiparticle while propagating, which will turn back into the original particle, and so on. This is called particle oscillation. On observing the weak decay ''into leptons'', it was found that a {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} always decayed into an positron, whereas the antiparticle {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}} decayed into the electron. The earlier analysis yielded a relation between the rate of electron and positron production from sources of pure {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and its antiparticle {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}}. Analysis of the time dependence of this [[semileptonic decay]] showed the phenomenon of oscillation, and allowed the extraction of the mass splitting between the {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} and {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}}. Since this is due to weak interactions it is very small, 10<sup>\u221215</sup> times the mass of each state.\n\n====Regeneration====\nA beam of neutral kaons decays in flight so that the short-lived {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} disappears, leaving a beam of pure long-lived {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}}. If this beam is shot into matter, then the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and its antiparticle {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}} interact differently with the nuclei. The {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} undergoes quasi-[[elastic scattering]] with [[nucleon]]s, whereas its antiparticle can create [[hyperon]]s. Due to the different interactions of the two components, [[quantum coherence]] between the two particles is lost. The emerging beam then contains different linear superpositions of the {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and {{SubatomicParticle|AntiKaon0}}. Such a superposition is a mixture of {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} and {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}}; the {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} is regenerated by passing a neutral kaon beam through matter. Regeneration was observed by [[Oreste Piccioni]] and his collaborators at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. Soon thereafter, Robert Adair and his coworkers reported excess {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} regeneration, thus opening a new chapter in this history.\n\n===CP violation===\nWhile trying to verify Adair's results, J. Christenson, [[James Cronin]], [[Val Fitch]] and [[Rene Turlay]] of [[Princeton University]] found decays of {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} into two pions ('''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1)\nin an [[Fitch-Cronin experiment|experiment performed in 1964]] at the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven laboratory]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evidence for the 2\u03c0 Decay of the K<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup> Meson|first1=J.

Alternative explanations such as nonlinear quantum mechanics and a new unobserved particle were soon ruled out, leaving CP violation as the only possibility. Cronin and Fitch received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery in 1980.\n\nIt turns out that although the {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} and {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} are [[weak interaction|weak]] [[eigenstates]] (because they have definite [[mean lifetime|lifetimes]] for decay by way of the weak force), they are ''not quite'' '''CP''' eigenstates. Instead, for small \u03b5 (and up to normalization),\n\n:{{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} = '''K<sub>2</sub>''' + \u03b5'''K<sub>1</sub>'''\n\nand similarly for {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}}. Thus occasionally the {{SubatomicParticle|K-long}} decays as a '''K<sub>1</sub>''' with '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, and likewise the {{SubatomicParticle|K-short}} can decay with '''CP'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121. This is known as '''indirect CP violation''', CP violation due to mixing of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and its antiparticle. There is also a '''direct CP violation''' effect, in which the CP violation occurs during the decay itself. Both are present, because both mixing and decay arise from the same interaction with the [[W boson]] and thus have CP violation predicted by the [[CKM matrix]]. Direct CP violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the [[NA48]] and [[KTeV]] experiments at CERN and Fermilab.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|kaon}}\n*[[Hadron]]s, [[meson]]s, [[hyperon]]s and [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]\n*[[Strange quark]] and the [[quark model]]\n*[[Parity (physics)]], [[charge conjugation]], [[T-symmetry|time reversal symmetry]], [[CPT invariance]] and [[CP violation]]\n*[[Neutrino oscillation]]\n* [[Neutral particle oscillation]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Amsler |first1=C. |last2=Doser |first2=M. |last3=Antonelli |first3=M. |last4=Asner |first4=D. |last5=Babu |first5=K. |last6=Baer |first6=H. |last7=Band |first7=H. |last8=Barnett |first8=R. |last9=Bergren |first9=E. |last10=Bergren |first10=E. |last11=Beringer |first11=J. |last12=Bernardi |first12=G. |last13=Bertl |first13=W. |last14=Bichsel |first14=H. |last15=Biebel |first15=O. |last16=Bloch |first16=P. |last17=Blucher |first17=E. |last18=Blusk |first18=S. |last19=Cahn |first19=R.N. |last20=Carena |first20=M. |last21=Caso |first21=C. |last22=Ceccucci |first22=A. |last23=Chakraborty |first23=D. |last24=Chen |first24=M.-C. |last25=Chivukula |first25=R.S. |last26=Cowan |first26=G. |last27=Dahl |first27=O. |last28=d'Ambrosio |first28=G. |last29=Damour |first29=T. |last30=de Gouv\u00eaa |first30=A. |displayauthors=6 |collaboration=[[Particle Data Group]] |year=2008 |title=Review of Particle Physics |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=667 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20131340 |bibcode=2008PhLB..667....1A |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.07.018|url=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/11249/2/scalarsV.pdf }}\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Eidelman |first1=S. |last2=Hayes |first2=K.G. |last3=Olive |first3=K.A. |last4=Aguilar-Benitez |first4=M. |last5=Amsler |first5=C. |last6=Asner |first6=D. |last7=Babu |first7=K.S. |last8=Barnett |first8=R.M. |last9=Beringer |first9=J. |last10=Burchat |first10=P.R. |last11=Carone |first11=C.D. |last12=Caso |first12=S. |last13=Conforto |first13=G. |last14=Dahl |first14=O. |last15=d'Ambrosio |first15=G. |last16=Doser |first16=M. |last17=Feng |first17=J.
