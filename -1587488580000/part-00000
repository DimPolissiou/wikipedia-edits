They also exported instruments to India, Newfoundland, Russia, Australia, Canada and the West Indies. Erection of the organ at Enmore began with its unpacking in the church on 17 December 1883 and was completed on 22 December 1883.  The formal opening took place on 1 January 1884.

They also exported instruments to India, Newfoundland, Russia, Australia, Canada and the West Indies. Erection of the organ at Enmore began with its unpacking in the church on 17 December 1883 and was completed on 22 December 1883.  The formal opening took place on 1 January 1884.

Father Charles F. Pashler (Rector, 1925\u201359) was the first Anglo-Catholic incumbent and instituted Full Catholic Privileges by the early 1930s. [[St Teresa of Calcutta]] visited the parish in the 1980s during the incumbency of Father Robert Greene, [[Society of the Holy Cross|SSC]] (Rector, 1977\u201393).<ref>Daniel van Allen Walker and William John Watts, Satisfying Hunger: The Many Lives of St Bartholomew's (Toronto, 1998), pp. 62-3.</ref> The parish has historic ties to the [[Sisterhood of St. John the Divine]], the Order of St Francis (now the [[Society of St Francis]]), and both historic and continuing ties to the [[Order of the Holy Cross]]. [[Healey Willan]] was a frequent visitor to the Clergy House at St Bart's during the tenure of his student, Alex Shaw (1929\u201363), as Choir Master.<ref>Daniel van Allen Walker and William John Watts, Satisfying Hunger: The Many Lives of St Bartholomew's (Toronto, 1998), pp. 79.</ref> Shaw's successor, Walter Barnes (1963\u201384), had been a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Willan's student, Walter McNutt, Choir Master at St Thomas's, Huron Street.<ref>Daniel van Allen Walker and William John Watts, Satisfying Hunger: The Many Lives of St Bartholomew's (Toronto, 1998), pp. 85.</ref> During Barnes's tenure, the well-known St Bart's Boys' Choir toured widely, including performances at [[Expo 67]], and recorded two long play records on the [[Arc Records (Canada)]] label.

Music traditions have been carried on by Willan's successors, notably Giles Bryant, Robert Hunter Bell, Stephanie Martin and the current Director of Music, Andrew Adair. Under Bell's direction, SMM choirs had two international CD releases on the Virgin Classics label of Willan's liturgical music.\n|-\n|[[St. Matthias Bellwoods]]\n| Toronto\n| Self-identifies as Anglo-Catholic. Established in 1873, St Matthias was one of the first Anglican churches in Toronto to offer Anglo-Catholic liturgy. Weekly Sunday mass is celebrated using the modern language rite from the Book of Alternative Services. Among many statues there is one with votive lights dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. There are Stations of the Cross, plus a tabernacle located on the old east-facing altar. Devotions are held weekly during Lent, which include Stations of the Cross and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.\n| Mostly known for being the first Anglican church to offer an annual Blessing of Animals service. The hymn tune Bellwoods, sung in many countries to the text \"O day of God draw nigh,\" by the Canadian theologian Robert B.Y. Scott, was written by James Hopkirk, a former organist at St. Matthias and named for the parish. St Matthias also has enjoyed the reputation for being hospitable, friendly, and inclusive.

The four voyages of Columbus led to the widespread knowledge that a continent existed west of Europe and east of [[Asia]]. This breakthrough in geographical knowledge inaugurated a period of [[Age of Discovery|exploration]], [[Conquistador|conquest]], [[History of colonialism#Portuguese and Spanish exploration and colonization|colonization]], [[Columbian exchange|biological exchange]], and [[trans-Atlantic trade]], whose effects and consequences persist to the present, and are sometimes cited as the start of the [[modern era]].<ref>Mills, Keneth and Taylor, William B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww-J9Kjb2KgC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=discovery+of+america+marks+modern+era&source=bl&ots=cdiXQBXk3_&sig=7h4YTsP70BUalD1D37ck_bMBTfM&hl=es&sa=X&ei=evwRU5qGHqLm7AaZ24CgCg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=discovery%20of%20america%20marks%20modern%20era&f=false], p. 36, SR Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8420-2573-1}}</ref> \n\nIt was long believed that Columbus had been the first European explorer to reach the Americas, but in fact he had been preceded by the [[Vinland|Viking expedition]] led by [[Leif Erikson]] in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml |title=History \u2013 Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151011-columbus-day-leif-erikson-italian-americans-holiday-history/ |title=Why Do We Celebrate Columbus Day and Not Leif Erikson Day? |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> However, Columbus's voyages were the ones that led to ongoing European contact with the Americas. \n\nColumbus was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[navigator]] sailing for the [[Crown of Castile]] (Spain) in search of a westward route to the [[East Indies|Indies]], the vaguely rumored East Asian sources of [[Spice trade|spices]] and other precious oriental goods obtainable only through arduous [[Silk Road|overland routes]]. Although he did not realize it, this search failed when he encountered the [[New World]] between Europe and Asia. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502.\n\nAt the time of Columbus' voyages, the Americas were inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|descendants]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|crossed]] [[Beringia]] from [[Asia]] to [[North America]] beginning around 20,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|last3=Saavedra|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Sawakuchi|first4=Andre Oliveira|last5=Vega|first5=Rodrigo M.|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|last7=Collins|first7=Michael B.|last8=Cummings|first8=Linda Scott|last9=Arregui|first9=Iv\u00e1n|author-link1=Tom Dillehay|author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|date=2015-11-18|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651426|pmid=26580202}}</ref>  Soon after first contact, [[Pandemic|Eurasian diseases]] such as [[smallpox]] began to devastate the indigenous populations, which had no immunity to them. \n\nIn 1513, the search for a westward route to Asia continued when [[Vasco Nu\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the narrow [[Isthmus of Panama]] to become the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the New World. The search was completed in 1521, when the Castilian (''Spanish'') [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] sailed across the Pacific and reached [[Southeast Asia]], returning to Europe after sailing further West and achieving the first circumnavigation of the world.\n\n==Background to the voyages==\n[[File:Fernandez-Virgin of the Navigators (proper inversion).jpg|thumb|''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'' by [[Alejo Fern\u00e1ndez]] dating to between 1531 and 1536 and depicting Columbus and others of importance in the first years of Spanish exploration<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite journal |last1=Rahn |first1=Phillips Carla |title=Visualizing Imperium: The Virgin of the Seafarers and Spain's Self-Image in the Early Sixteenth Century * |journal=Renaissance Quarterly |date=NaN |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=815\u2013856 |doi=10.1353/ren.2008.0864 |language=en |issn=0034-4338}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Portugal]] had been the main European power interested in pursuing trade routes overseas. Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341</ref>\n\n===Funding campaign===\nHe proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made \"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" (Atlantic Ocean), appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and be given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was far too short.<ref name = \"Morison-Admiral\"/>\n\nIn 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.\n\n====Spanish procurement====\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the Catholic Monarchs, and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.\n\nColumbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.\n\nHowever, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.<ref>Durant, Will ''\"The Story of Civilization\"'' Vol. VI, \"The Reformation\".

Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' (castle) in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] to support his plans.\n\nThe monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.\n\nAccording to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.<ref>Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Navigation plans===\nEurope had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India\u2014sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]\u2014under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular \"[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]],\" the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=\"book3\">{{cite book | first=Paul F | last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/notsopopularmyth00boll }}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]].

In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.<ref name=Sagan /> Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe.

Accepting the length of a degree to be 56\u2154 miles<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}<!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--> at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref> and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.\n\nEuropeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Trade winds====\nThere was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an \"[[Easterlies|easterly]]\", propelled ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Ni\u00f1a|La Ni\u00f1a]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Upwind|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. So he used the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, in both legs of his voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014015153/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=2009-10-14}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Voyages and events==\n\n===First voyage===\n\nAt 8:00 on the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus departed from Carolina [[Palos de la Frontera]] (on the [[Rio Saltes|river Saltes]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] and [[Rio Odiel]]).<ref name=\"tharoor\">{{cite magazine|last1=Tharoor|first1=Shashi|title=Trying to discover India|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/trying-to-discover-india/292728|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Outlook India|date=8 December 2014}}</ref> Columbus and his crew embarked on a voyage to find a shorter route to [[India]] and the [[Orient]] with three medium-sized ships, the ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the [[Pinta (ship)|''Pinta'']], and the [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Maria'']].

Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered [[Intermediate Area|transitional between those two cultural areas]].\n\nColumbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on October 28, 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by December 5, 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.\n\nOn January 15, 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Ni\u00f1a''.\n\n====First return====\nWhile returning to Spain, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of February 13, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Ni\u00f1a'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Ni\u00f1a moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Ni\u00f1a, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Ni\u00f1a'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17\u201323|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}</ref>\n\nLeaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on February 23, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Para\u00edso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on March 15, 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.\n\nColumbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearl]]s, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to \"make sure it was not poisoned\". He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote \"there is also plenty of 'aj\u00ed', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome\".<ref>Turner, 2004, p. 11</ref> The word \"aj\u00ed\" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.\n\n[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: \"Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. ... There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals...\"<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\">{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780061989834|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n====Papal decree====\n{{further|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\nAfter Columbus's return, [[Pope Alexander VI]] [[Inter caetera|issued a bull]] which divided the \"newly discovered\" lands outside Europe between [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portugal]] along a north-south meridian 958 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic), thus granting Spain all land discovered by Columbus.

Accessed 21 May 2012.</ref>\n\n====Caribbean exploration====\nOn November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Mar\u00eda la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa Mar\u00eda de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa \u00darsula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.<ref>Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus</ref>\n\n====Hispaniola and Jamaica====\nOn November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named [[Caonabo]] in Maguana, was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. Finding some, he established a small fort in the interior.\n\nHe left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana ([[Cuba]]) (which he had discovered and named during his first voyage) on April 30 and [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica]] on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.\n\n====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====\nDuring the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.<ref>Montague, Peter. \"Celebrating Columbus Day\".

Web. 22 Feb. 2016.</ref>\n\nThe many voyages of discovery did not pay for themselves, and there was no funding for pure science in the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Columbus had planned for Queen Isabella to set up trading posts with the cities of the Far East made famous by [[Marco Polo]], but whose Silk Road and eastern maritime routes had been blockaded to her crown's trade. Of course, Columbus would never find [[Cathay]] ([[China]]) or [[Zipangu]] ([[Japan]]), and there was no longer any Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] for trade treaties.\n\n[[Slavery]] was practiced widely at that time amongst many peoples of the world, including some Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For the Portuguese\u2014from whom Columbus received most of his maritime training\u2014the profits from enslaving people had resulted in the first \"financial return\" on a 75-year [[investment]] in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus enslaved five hundred and sixty people.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150602025738/https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-1600-textbook/early-modern-europe-12/the-age-of-discovery-57/spanish-exploration-and-the-voyages-of-christopher-columbus-217-13333/</ref> The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the ''Cortes'', some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their ''las Americas'' homeland, whereas others were used by Queen Isabella as galley slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Columbus, desperate to repay his investors, failed to realize that Isabella and Ferdinand did not plan to follow or allow Portuguese slavery policy{{which|date=May 2013}} in this respect. Rounding up the slaves led to the first major battle between the Spanish and the native peoples in their homeland, called by Europeans \"the [[New World]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus was eager to pay back dividends to those who had invested in his promise to fill his ships with gold. And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cibao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cibaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks. Any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off and subsequently bled to death.<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\"/> Since there were no gold mines on the island, the Indians had no chance of meeting Columbus' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide.<ref>Koning, Hans. Columbus, His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976: 83-83.</ref>\n\nDespite or because of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign \"settlers\" were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of getting rich quickly. A classic [[gold rush]] had been set off that would have tragic consequences for the [[Caribbean]]'s indigenous people and cultures. Anthropologists have shown there was more intermarriage and assimilation than previously believed (see the [[Black legend (Spain)]]).{{Citation needed|reason=9 May 2010|date=May 2010}} Columbus allowed settlers to return to their homeland with any Indian women with whom they had started families, or to Queen Isabella's fury, had kidnapped and owned as slaves.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Third voyage===\n[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Third voyage]]\n\n====Exploration====\n[[File:AndalusAndMorocco.png|275px|thumb|Location of [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus's third journey.]]\nAccording to the abstract of Columbus's journal made by [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.

He then sailed to the island of [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. The ships found King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 124</ref> The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 125</ref> Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on August 2.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 126</ref>\n\nFrom August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates Trinidad from mainland [[Venezuela]]. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]).\n\n===Governorship issues===\n\n====Colonist rebellions====\nAfter his second journey, Columbus had requested that 330 people be sent to stay permanently (though voluntarily) on Hispaniola, all on the King's pay.   Specifically, he asked for 100 men to work as wood men soldiers and laborers, 50 farmers, 40 squires, 30 sailors, 30 cabin boys, 20 goldsmiths, 10 gardeners, 20 handymen, and 30 women.  In addition to this, plans were made to maintain friars and clergymen, a physician, a pharmacist, an herbalist, and musicians for entertaining the colonists.   Fearing that the King was going to restrict money allotted for wages, Columbus suggested that Spanish criminals be pardoned in exchange for a few years unpaid service in Hispaniola, and the King agreed to this.  A pardon for the death penalty would require 2 years of service, and one year of service was required for lesser crimes.  They also instructed that those who had been sentenced to exile would also be redirected to be exiled in Hispaniola.<ref> Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9. \"History of the Indies\". \"Trans. Andr\u00e9e M.

As these new Colonists arrived on Hispaniola, a rebellion was brewing under Francisco Rold\u00e1n (a man Columbus had left as chief mayor, under his brothers Diego and Bartolomew).   By the time Columbus arrived on Hispaniola, Rold\u00e1n held the territory of Xaragu\u00e1, and some of the new colonists had joined his rebellion.   Over months, Columbus tried negotiating with the rebels.  At some point in these negotiations Columbus ordered Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica, Rold\u00e1n's partner in rebellion, to be hanged.   Eventually, though, he capitulated to much of the Rold\u00e1n's demands.   Several other revolts broke out after that, but Rold\u00e1n, now restored as mayor, took part in putting them down, and tried and hanged one of the ringleaders, Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica.    <ref>\"[https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php Columbus: The Four Voyages, 1492-1504]\", by Laurence Bergreen, Penguin Books, 2012, Chapter 9, https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php </ref>\n\n====Governor Bobadilla====\nDuring Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called \"the tyrant of the Caribbean\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.\n\nThe Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom\u00e9, and Diego.

He was 49 years old.\n\n====Arrest of Governor Columbus====\nColumbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[C\u00e1diz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:\n<blockquote>\nIt is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...\n\nI beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]\nColumbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].\n\nAlthough he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.\n\n===Fourth voyage===\n[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]\n\nColumbus's fourth voyage was his final chance to prove himself and become the first man ever to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]]. The goal was to find a westward passage through Central America and reach the [[Maluku Islands]], also known as the [[Spice islands|Spice Islands]].\n\nHis project turned into one of history's most epic--and forgotten--''''''adventures''''. Columbus would later claim that this fourth voyage was his greatest. It was without question his most daring, riskiest and most challenging<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?197565-1/the-voyage-columbus|title=The Last Voyage of Columbus|website=C-Span}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 1502 Columbus started his fourth voyage with 147 men and with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Col\u00f3n|Fernando]], he left [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizca\u00edna,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''.\n\nHe sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the '''Portuguese''' soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica).\n\nColumbus anticipated a [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Haina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.\n\nAfter surviving the hurricane he left Hispaniola and after a brief stop at [[Jamaica]] and off the coast of [[Cuba]] to replenish, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de los Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as \"long as a galley\" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]] looking for the passage, before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.\n\nIn Panam\u00e1, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Bel\u00e9n River]] in January 1503.\n\nBy April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local tribe leader [[El Quib\u00edan]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Bel\u00e9n River. El Quib\u00edan escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.\n\n[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus fills the natives with fear and awe by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]]]]\nFor a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus had to mesmerize the natives in order to prevent being attacked by them and gain their goodwill. He did so by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653\u2013654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184\u2013192.</ref>\n\nIn May of 1504 a battle took place between men loyal to Columbus and those loyal to the Porras brothers, in which there was a sword fight between Bartolom\u00e9 Col\u00f3n and Francisco de Porras. Bartholomew Columbus won against Francisco but he spared his life. In this way, the mutiny ended.\n\nHelp finally arrived from the governor Ovando, on June 29, 1504, when a caravel sent by Diego M\u00e9ndez finally appeared on the island. At this time there were 110 members of the expedition alive out of the 147 that sailed from Spain with Columbus. Due to the strong winds, the caravel had to stop by the road, taking 45 days to reach La Hispaniola. Previously this was a trip that Diego M\u00e9ndez had made in four days in a canoe.\n\nAbout 38 of the 110 men that survived decided not to board again and stayed in Hispaniola instead of returning to Spain. On September 11, 1504 Christopher Columbus and his son Hernando embarked in a caravel to travel from Hispaniola to Spain, paying their corresponding tickets. They arrived in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on November 7, 1504 and from there they traveled to Seville, where Col\u00f3n denounced to the authorities that the gold that came in the caravel for the Crown had been adulterated and claimed for himself a part for having made the accusation\n\nColumbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.\n\n===Aftermath===\nColumbus did not find the maritime passage through Central America. However, the Spanish conquistador [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Vasco Nunez de Balboa]], exploring overland, became the first European to encounter the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the Americas on September 25, 1513, calling it the \"South Sea\".\n\nLater, on October 29, 1520, [[Magellan's circumnavigation]] expedition discovered the first  maritime passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, at the southern end of what is now Chile ([[Strait of Magellan]]), and his fleet ended up sailing around the whole Earth. Almost a century later, another, wider passage to the Pacific would be discovered farther to the south, bordering [[Cape Horn]].\n\nOn August 15, 1914, the United States completed the [[Panama Canal]], one of the great feats of modern construction, which allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Central America.\n\n==Pleitos Colombinos==\nAfter his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512 lasting until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald (2005). ''Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488\u20131539)''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2644-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.\n\nWith the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\nColumbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Columbus Day]]\n* [[Columbus's vow]]\n* [[Juan de la Cosa]]\n* [[The Grand Exchange]]\n* [[Guanahani]] (a discussion of candidates for site of first landing)\n* [[Lugares colombinos]]\n* [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]\n* [[The Pinz\u00f3n Brothers]]\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n* [[Exploration of North America]]\n* [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[Amerigo Vespucci]]\n* [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]\n\n==References==\n; General information\n* Clements R.

The four voyages of Columbus led to the widespread knowledge that a continent existed west of Europe and east of [[Asia]]. This breakthrough in geographical knowledge inaugurated a period of [[Age of Discovery|exploration]], [[Conquistador|conquest]], [[History of colonialism#Portuguese and Spanish exploration and colonization|colonization]], [[Columbian exchange|biological exchange]], and [[trans-Atlantic trade]], whose effects and consequences persist to the present, and are sometimes cited as the start of the [[modern era]].<ref>Mills, Keneth and Taylor, William B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww-J9Kjb2KgC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=discovery+of+america+marks+modern+era&source=bl&ots=cdiXQBXk3_&sig=7h4YTsP70BUalD1D37ck_bMBTfM&hl=es&sa=X&ei=evwRU5qGHqLm7AaZ24CgCg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=discovery%20of%20america%20marks%20modern%20era&f=false], p. 36, SR Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8420-2573-1}}</ref> \n\nIt was long believed that Columbus had been the first European explorer to reach the Americas, but in fact he had been preceded by the [[Vinland|Viking expedition]] led by [[Leif Erikson]] in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml |title=History \u2013 Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151011-columbus-day-leif-erikson-italian-americans-holiday-history/ |title=Why Do We Celebrate Columbus Day and Not Leif Erikson Day? |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> However, Columbus's voyages were the ones that led to ongoing European contact with the Americas. \n\nColumbus was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[navigator]] sailing for the [[Crown of Castile]] (Spain) in search of a westward route to the [[East Indies|Indies]], the vaguely rumored East Asian sources of [[Spice trade|spices]] and other precious oriental goods obtainable only through arduous [[Silk Road|overland routes]]. Although he did not realize it, this search failed when he encountered the [[New World]] between Europe and Asia. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502.\n\nAt the time of Columbus' voyages, the Americas were inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|descendants]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|crossed]] [[Beringia]] from [[Asia]] to [[North America]] beginning around 20,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|last3=Saavedra|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Sawakuchi|first4=Andre Oliveira|last5=Vega|first5=Rodrigo M.|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|last7=Collins|first7=Michael B.|last8=Cummings|first8=Linda Scott|last9=Arregui|first9=Iv\u00e1n|author-link1=Tom Dillehay|author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|date=2015-11-18|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651426|pmid=26580202}}</ref>  Soon after first contact, [[Pandemic|Eurasian diseases]] such as [[smallpox]] began to devastate the indigenous populations, which had no immunity to them. \n\nIn 1513, the search for a westward route to Asia continued when [[Vasco Nu\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the narrow [[Isthmus of Panama]] to become the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the New World. The search was completed in 1521, when the Castilian (''Spanish'') [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] sailed across the Pacific and reached [[Southeast Asia]], returning to Europe after sailing further West and achieving the first circumnavigation of the world.\n\n==Background to the voyages==\n[[File:Fernandez-Virgin of the Navigators (proper inversion).jpg|thumb|''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'' by [[Alejo Fern\u00e1ndez]] dating to between 1531 and 1536 and depicting Columbus and others of importance in the first years of Spanish exploration<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite journal |last1=Rahn |first1=Phillips Carla |title=Visualizing Imperium: The Virgin of the Seafarers and Spain's Self-Image in the Early Sixteenth Century * |journal=Renaissance Quarterly |date=NaN |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=815\u2013856 |doi=10.1353/ren.2008.0864 |language=en |issn=0034-4338}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Portugal]] had been the main European power interested in pursuing trade routes overseas. Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341</ref>\n\n===Funding campaign===\nHe proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made \"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" (Atlantic Ocean), appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and be given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was far too short.<ref name = \"Morison-Admiral\"/>\n\nIn 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.\n\n====Spanish procurement====\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the Catholic Monarchs, and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.\n\nColumbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.\n\nHowever, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.<ref>Durant, Will ''\"The Story of Civilization\"'' Vol. VI, \"The Reformation\".

Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' (castle) in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] to support his plans.\n\nThe monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.\n\nAccording to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.<ref>Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Navigation plans===\nEurope had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India\u2014sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]\u2014under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular \"[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]],\" the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=\"book3\">{{cite book | first=Paul F | last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/notsopopularmyth00boll }}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]]. The knowledge that the Earth was spherical was widespread, and the means of calculating its diameter using an [[astrolabe]] was known to both scholars and navigators.<ref>Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991.

In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.<ref name=Sagan /> Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus's error was attributed to his insufficient experience in navigation at sea.<ref name=\"Morison-Admiral\">Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|The \"Columbus map\" was drawn circa 1490 in the workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus in [[Lisbon]].<ref>\"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles\", {{ISBN|978-2-35404-007-9}} p. 37</ref>]]\n[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by Christopher Columbus on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Le livre des merveilles'']]\nColumbus believed the incorrect calculations of [[Marinus of Tyre]],<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Christopher Columbus (Italian explorer) | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | edition = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc | year = 2013 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus | accessdate = September 12, 2013}}</ref> putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=STzVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Marinus+of+Tyre+225+135&source=bl&ots=lDjJ6eR5Sf&sig=0MDrD6oMNo4PXVY7Bf8ICxFOjO8&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=v7NhUpP3CubU4wTnhYHYCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Marinus%20of%20Tyre%20225%20135&f=false]<!--may be based on this article--></ref> Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the Earth's surface than was actually the case \u2013 he read maps as if the distances were calculated in [[Italian mile]]s (about 1,480 meters). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56\u2154 miles<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}<!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--> at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref> and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.\n\nEuropeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Trade winds====\nThere was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an \"[[Easterlies|easterly]]\", propelled ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Ni\u00f1a|La Ni\u00f1a]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Upwind|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. So he used the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, in both legs of his voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014015153/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=2009-10-14}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Voyages and events==\n\n===First voyage===\n\nAt 8:00 on the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus departed from Carolina [[Palos de la Frontera]] (on the [[Rio Saltes|river Saltes]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] and [[Rio Odiel]]).<ref name=\"tharoor\">{{cite magazine|last1=Tharoor|first1=Shashi|title=Trying to discover India|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/trying-to-discover-india/292728|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Outlook India|date=8 December 2014}}</ref> Columbus and his crew embarked on a voyage to find a shorter route to [[India]] and the [[Orient]] with three medium-sized ships, the ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the [[Pinta (ship)|''Pinta'']], and the [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Maria'']].

At the time of the European discovery of most of the islands of the Caribbean, three major indigenous peoples lived on the islands: the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] in the [[Greater Antilles]], the Bahamas, and the [[Leeward Islands]]; the [[Island Caribs]] (Kalina) and [[Galibi]] in the [[Windward Islands]] and [[Guadeloupe]]; and the [[Ciboney]] (a Ta\u00edno people) and [[Guanahatabey]] of central and western Cuba, respectively. The Ta\u00ednos are subdivided into Classic Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]]; Western Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Cuba, [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamian archipelago]]; and the Eastern Ta\u00ednos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rouse |first=Irving |title=The Ta\u00ednos : Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus |isbn=0-300-05696-6 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&pg=PA1}}</ref> [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib-speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups. Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered [[Intermediate Area|transitional between those two cultural areas]].\n\nColumbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on October 28, 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by December 5, 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.\n\nOn January 15, 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Ni\u00f1a''.\n\n====First return====\nWhile returning to Spain, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of February 13, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Ni\u00f1a'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Ni\u00f1a moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Ni\u00f1a, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Ni\u00f1a'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17\u201323|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}</ref>\n\nLeaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on February 23, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Para\u00edso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on March 15, 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.\n\nColumbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearl]]s, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to \"make sure it was not poisoned\". He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote \"there is also plenty of 'aj\u00ed', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome\".<ref>Turner, 2004, p. 11</ref> The word \"aj\u00ed\" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.\n\n[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: \"Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. ... There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals...\"<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\">{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780061989834|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n====Papal decree====\n{{further|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\nAfter Columbus's return, [[Pope Alexander VI]] [[Inter caetera|issued a bull]] which divided the \"newly discovered\" lands outside Europe between [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portugal]] along a north-south meridian 958 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic), thus granting Spain all land discovered by Columbus.

Accessed 21 May 2012.</ref>\n\n====Caribbean exploration====\nOn November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Mar\u00eda la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa Mar\u00eda de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa \u00darsula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.<ref>Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus</ref>\n\n====Hispaniola and Jamaica====\nOn November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named [[Caonabo]] in Maguana, was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. Finding some, he established a small fort in the interior.\n\nHe left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana ([[Cuba]]) (which he had discovered and named during his first voyage) on April 30 and [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica]] on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.\n\n====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====\nDuring the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.<ref>Montague, Peter. \"Celebrating Columbus Day\". ''Ecologist''. Dec. 1999: 468\u2013470. ''SIRS Issues Researcher''. Web. 22 Feb. 2016.</ref>\n\nThe many voyages of discovery did not pay for themselves, and there was no funding for pure science in the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Columbus had planned for Queen Isabella to set up trading posts with the cities of the Far East made famous by [[Marco Polo]], but whose Silk Road and eastern maritime routes had been blockaded to her crown's trade. Of course, Columbus would never find [[Cathay]] ([[China]]) or [[Zipangu]] ([[Japan]]), and there was no longer any Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] for trade treaties.\n\n[[Slavery]] was practiced widely at that time amongst many peoples of the world, including some Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For the Portuguese\u2014from whom Columbus received most of his maritime training\u2014the profits from enslaving people had resulted in the first \"financial return\" on a 75-year [[investment]] in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus enslaved five hundred and sixty people.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150602025738/https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-1600-textbook/early-modern-europe-12/the-age-of-discovery-57/spanish-exploration-and-the-voyages-of-christopher-columbus-217-13333/</ref> The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the ''Cortes'', some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their ''las Americas'' homeland, whereas others were used by Queen Isabella as galley slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Columbus, desperate to repay his investors, failed to realize that Isabella and Ferdinand did not plan to follow or allow Portuguese slavery policy{{which|date=May 2013}} in this respect. Rounding up the slaves led to the first major battle between the Spanish and the native peoples in their homeland, called by Europeans \"the [[New World]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus was eager to pay back dividends to those who had invested in his promise to fill his ships with gold. And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cibao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cibaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks. Any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off and subsequently bled to death.<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\"/> Since there were no gold mines on the island, the Indians had no chance of meeting Columbus' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide.<ref>Koning, Hans. Columbus, His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976: 83-83.</ref>\n\nDespite or because of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign \"settlers\" were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of getting rich quickly. A classic [[gold rush]] had been set off that would have tragic consequences for the [[Caribbean]]'s indigenous people and cultures. Anthropologists have shown there was more intermarriage and assimilation than previously believed (see the [[Black legend (Spain)]]).{{Citation needed|reason=9 May 2010|date=May 2010}} Columbus allowed settlers to return to their homeland with any Indian women with whom they had started families, or to Queen Isabella's fury, had kidnapped and owned as slaves.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Third voyage===\n[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Third voyage]]\n\n====Exploration====\n[[File:AndalusAndMorocco.png|275px|thumb|Location of [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus's third journey.]]\nAccording to the abstract of Columbus's journal made by [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.

The ships found King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 124</ref> The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 125</ref> Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on August 2.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 126</ref>\n\nFrom August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates Trinidad from mainland [[Venezuela]]. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]).\n\n===Governorship issues===\n\n====Colonist rebellions====\nAfter his second journey, Columbus had requested that 330 people be sent to stay permanently (though voluntarily) on Hispaniola, all on the King's pay.   Specifically, he asked for 100 men to work as wood men soldiers and laborers, 50 farmers, 40 squires, 30 sailors, 30 cabin boys, 20 goldsmiths, 10 gardeners, 20 handymen, and 30 women.  In addition to this, plans were made to maintain friars and clergymen, a physician, a pharmacist, an herbalist, and musicians for entertaining the colonists.   Fearing that the King was going to restrict money allotted for wages, Columbus suggested that Spanish criminals be pardoned in exchange for a few years unpaid service in Hispaniola, and the King agreed to this.  A pardon for the death penalty would require 2 years of service, and one year of service was required for lesser crimes.  They also instructed that those who had been sentenced to exile would also be redirected to be exiled in Hispaniola.<ref> Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9. \"History of the Indies\". \"Trans. Andr\u00e9e M.

As these new Colonists arrived on Hispaniola, a rebellion was brewing under Francisco Rold\u00e1n (a man Columbus had left as chief mayor, under his brothers Diego and Bartolomew).   By the time Columbus arrived on Hispaniola, Rold\u00e1n held the territory of Xaragu\u00e1, and some of the new colonists had joined his rebellion.   Over months, Columbus tried negotiating with the rebels.  At some point in these negotiations Columbus ordered Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica, Rold\u00e1n's partner in rebellion, to be hanged.   Eventually, though, he capitulated to much of the Rold\u00e1n's demands.   Several other revolts broke out after that, but Rold\u00e1n, now restored as mayor, took part in putting them down, and tried and hanged one of the ringleaders, Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica.    <ref>\"[https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php Columbus: The Four Voyages, 1492-1504]\", by Laurence Bergreen, Penguin Books, 2012, Chapter 9, https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php </ref>\n\n====Governor Bobadilla====\nDuring Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called \"the tyrant of the Caribbean\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.\n\nThe Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom\u00e9, and Diego. The testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers\u2014had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus's seven-year reign as the first [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].

It contained an account of Columbus's seven-year reign as the first [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].</ref>\n\nAs a result of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in his own defense, Columbus upon his return, had manacles placed on his wrists and chains placed on his ankles and was cast into prison to await return to Spain. He was 49 years old.\n\n====Arrest of Governor Columbus====\nColumbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[C\u00e1diz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:\n<blockquote>\nIt is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...\n\nI beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]\nColumbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].\n\nAlthough he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.\n\n===Fourth voyage===\n[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]\n\nColumbus's fourth voyage was his final chance to prove himself and become the first man ever to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]]. The goal was to find a westward passage through Central America and reach the [[Maluku Islands]], also known as the [[Spice islands|Spice Islands]].\n\nHis project turned into one of history's most epic--and forgotten--''''''adventures''''. Columbus would later claim that this fourth voyage was his greatest. It was without question his most daring, riskiest and most challenging<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?197565-1/the-voyage-columbus|title=The Last Voyage of Columbus|website=C-Span}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 1502 Columbus started his fourth voyage with 147 men and with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Col\u00f3n|Fernando]], he left [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizca\u00edna,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''.\n\nHe sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the '''Portuguese''' soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica).\n\nColumbus anticipated a [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Haina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.\n\nAfter surviving the hurricane he left Hispaniola and after a brief stop at [[Jamaica]] and off the coast of [[Cuba]] to replenish, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de los Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as \"long as a galley\" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]] looking for the passage, before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.\n\nIn Panam\u00e1, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Bel\u00e9n River]] in January 1503.\n\nBy April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local tribe leader [[El Quib\u00edan]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Bel\u00e9n River. El Quib\u00edan escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.\n\n[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus fills the natives with fear and awe by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]]]]\nFor a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus had to mesmerize the natives in order to prevent being attacked by them and gain their goodwill. He did so by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653\u2013654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184\u2013192.</ref>\n\nIn May of 1504 a battle took place between men loyal to Columbus and those loyal to the Porras brothers, in which there was a sword fight between Bartolom\u00e9 Col\u00f3n and Francisco de Porras. Bartholomew Columbus won against Francisco but he spared his life. In this way, the mutiny ended.\n\nHelp finally arrived from the governor Ovando, on June 29, 1504, when a caravel sent by Diego M\u00e9ndez finally appeared on the island. At this time there were 110 members of the expedition alive out of the 147 that sailed from Spain with Columbus. Due to the strong winds, the caravel had to stop by the road, taking 45 days to reach La Hispaniola. Previously this was a trip that Diego M\u00e9ndez had made in four days in a canoe.\n\nAbout 38 of the 110 men that survived decided not to board again and stayed in Hispaniola instead of returning to Spain. On September 11, 1504 Christopher Columbus and his son Hernando embarked in a caravel to travel from Hispaniola to Spain, paying their corresponding tickets. They arrived in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on November 7, 1504 and from there they traveled to Seville, where Col\u00f3n denounced to the authorities that the gold that came in the caravel for the Crown had been adulterated and claimed for himself a part for having made the accusation\n\nColumbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.\n\n===Aftermath===\nColumbus did not find the maritime passage through Central America. However, the Spanish conquistador [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Vasco Nunez de Balboa]], exploring overland, became the first European to encounter the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the Americas on September 25, 1513, calling it the \"South Sea\".\n\nLater, on October 29, 1520, [[Magellan's circumnavigation]] expedition discovered the first  maritime passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, at the southern end of what is now Chile ([[Strait of Magellan]]), and his fleet ended up sailing around the whole Earth. Almost a century later, another, wider passage to the Pacific would be discovered farther to the south, bordering [[Cape Horn]].\n\nOn August 15, 1914, the United States completed the [[Panama Canal]], one of the great feats of modern construction, which allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Central America.\n\n==Pleitos Colombinos==\nAfter his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512 lasting until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald (2005). ''Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488\u20131539)''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2644-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.\n\nWith the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\nColumbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Columbus Day]]\n* [[Columbus's vow]]\n* [[Juan de la Cosa]]\n* [[The Grand Exchange]]\n* [[Guanahani]] (a discussion of candidates for site of first landing)\n* [[Lugares colombinos]]\n* [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]\n* [[The Pinz\u00f3n Brothers]]\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n* [[Exploration of North America]]\n* [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[Amerigo Vespucci]]\n* [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]\n\n==References==\n; General information\n* Clements R.

The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged [[#Standard library|standard library]].  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at [[Bell Labs]] since 1979 as an extension of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided [[High-level programming language|high-level features]] for program organization.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage |url=http://www.stroustrup.com |website=www.stroustrup.com}}</ref> [[C++20]] is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title = C++; Where it's heading |url=https://dzone.com/articles/c-where-is-it-heading-and-what-are-the-new-feature}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BjarneStroustrup.jpg|thumb|Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, in his AT&T New Jersey office c. 2000]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Danish [[computer scientist]], began work on \"{{visible anchor|C with [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]}}\", the predecessor to C++.<ref name=\"invention3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#invention|title = Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ: When was C++ invented?|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|website = stroustrup.com|date = 7 March 2010|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that [[Simula]] had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while [[BCPL]] was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in [[AT&T Bell Labs]], he had the problem of analyzing the [[Unix|UNIX]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with respect to [[distributed computing]]. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the [[C (programming language)|C]] language with [[Simula]]-like features.<ref name=\"evolving\">{{cite web |url = http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf|title = Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup}}\n</ref> C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including [[ALGOL 68]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]].\n\nInitially, Stroustrup's \"C with Classes\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including [[class (computer programming)|classes]], [[derived class]]es, [[strong typing]], [[inlining]] and [[default argument]]s.<ref name=\"hopl2\">{{cite web|last1=Stroustrup|first1=Bjarne|title=A History of C ++ : 1979\u2212 1991|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \"C++\" (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>++</syntaxhighlight> being the [[increment operator]] in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including [[virtual function]]s, function name and [[operator overloading]], references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight>). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, [[Cfront]].\n\nIn 1985, the first edition of ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]'' was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.<ref name=\"1st-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/1st.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = First|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.<ref name=\"invention3\"/>\n\nIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of ''The C++ Programming Language'' in 1991.<ref name=\"2nd-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/2nd.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = Second|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}</ref> New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, [[const correctness|const member functions]], and protected members. In 1990, ''The Annotated C++ Reference Manual'' was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included [[template (programming)|template]]s, [[exception handling|exceptions]], [[namespaces]], new [[cast (computer science)|cast]]s, and a [[Boolean datatype|Boolean type]].\n\n[[Image:20160121 CppFRUG Joel Falcou CppQuiz 3.jpg|thumb|left|A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015]]\n\nIn 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update ([[C++03]]) was released in 2003.\n\nAfter C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the [[C++11]] standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers.

The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard (though there are some rules defined below) to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation. More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that \"shall last for the duration of the program\".<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.1\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

First, \"static initialization\" is performed, and only ''after'' all static initialization is performed, \"dynamic initialization\" is performed.  In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or <code>constexpr</code>). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable.  Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with <code>constexpr</code>, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.\n\n==== Thread storage duration objects ====\nVariables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.2\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

''[https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf Programming Languages \u2013 C++11 Draft (n3797)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002093659/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf |date=2 October 2018 }} \u00a73.7.3 Automatic Storage duration [basic.stc.auto]''</ref> The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the ''reverse'' order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]].\n\nLocal variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|RAII]], which is widely used in C++.\n\nMember variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an \"automatic object\" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.\n\nTemporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the <code>;</code> at the end of a statement).\n\n==== Dynamic storage duration objects ====\n{{Main|new and delete (C++)}}\n\nThese objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to {{cpp|new}} and destroyed explicitly with a call to {{cpp|delete}}.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.4\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

Use of {{cpp|new}} returns an address to the allocated memory.

C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by ''instantiation'' at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \"[[Substitution failure is not an error]]\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for [[generic programming]], [[template metaprogramming]], and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., [[Generics in Java|Java]]) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.\n\nTemplates are different from [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]s: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] (see below) and [[generic programming]].\n\nIn addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C++ that is [[Turing-complete]], meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a [[template metaprogramming|template metaprogram]] prior to runtime.\n\nIn summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.\n\n=== Objects ===\n{{Main|C++ classes}}\n\nC++ introduces [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) features to C. It offers [[class (computer science)|class]]es, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[Information hiding|encapsulation]], [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], which in turn provide support for the [[Resource Acquisition is Initialization]] (RAII) concept.\n\n==== Encapsulation ====\n[[Information hiding|Encapsulation]] is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\"friends\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.\n\nThe object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as [[Modularity (programming)|modular programming]].\n\nIt is generally considered good practice to make all [[data]] private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.<ref name=\"cppcs\">{{Cite book |first1=Herb |last1=Sutter |first2=Andrei |last2=Alexandrescu |authorlink1=Herb Sutter |authorlink2=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2004 |title=C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices |publisher = Addison-Wesley }}</ref><ref name=\"industrialcpp\">{{Cite book |last1=Henricson |first1=Mats |last2=Nyquist |first2=Erik |title=Industrial Strength C++ |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1997 |isbn=0-13-120965-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/industrialstreng0000henr }}</ref>\n\n==== Inheritance ====\n[[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]] allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a [[base class]] may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \"inheritance\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \"class\" inherits privately, while a \"struct\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called [[virtual inheritance]]. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.\n\n[[Multiple inheritance]] is a C++ feature not found in most other languages, allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \"Flying Cat\" class can inherit from both \"Cat\" and \"Flying Mammal\". Some other languages, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an [[abstract base class]] or \"ABC\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called [[Dominance (C++)|dominance]].\n\n=== Operators and operator overloading ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0.5em 0 1em 2em;\"\n|+ Operators that cannot be overloaded\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Operator\n! style=\"width: 9em\" | Symbol\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Scope resolution operator\n| {{C-lang| ::}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Conditional operator\n| {{C-lang| ?:}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | dot operator\n| {{C-lang| .}}\n|-\n\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Member selection operator\n| {{C-lang| .*}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"sizeof\" operator\n| {{C-lang| sizeof}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"typeid\" operator\n| {{C-lang| typeid}}\n|}\n{{Main|Operators in C and C++}}\nC++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (<code>.</code> and <code>.*</code>) as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.\n\nOverloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as [[smart pointer]]s. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \"<code>&&</code>\" and \"<code>||</code>\" operators lose their [[short-circuit evaluation]] property.\n\n=== Polymorphism ===\n{{See also|Polymorphism (computer science)}}\n\n[[Type polymorphism|Polymorphism]] enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.\n\nC++ supports several kinds of ''static'' (resolved at [[compile-time]]) and ''dynamic'' (resolved at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]) [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]s, supported by the language features described above. [[Compile-time polymorphism]] does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while [[runtime polymorphism]] typically incurs a performance penalty.\n\n==== Static polymorphism ====\n{{See also|Parametric polymorphism|ad hoc polymorphism}}\n\n[[Function overloading]] allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. [[ad hoc polymorphism|''ad hoc'' polymorphism]]). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their [[Parameter (computer science)|formal parameter]]s. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compile-time error message.\n\nWhen declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a [[default arguments|default value]]. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.\n\n[[Generic programming#Templates|Templates]] in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. [[parametric polymorphism]]). In particular, through the [[curiously recurring template pattern]], it's possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and [[Turing-complete]], they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through [[template metaprogramming]]. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |accessdate=8 March 2010 |publisher=EmptyCrate Software.

This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types.\n\nC++ also provides the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type: ''downcasting''. The ''attempt'' is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (''Upcasting'', conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> relies on [[run-time type information]] (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> to a pointer fails, the result is the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>nullptr</syntaxhighlight> constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects ''known'' to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight>, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.\n\n===== Virtual member functions =====\nOrdinarily, when a function in a derived class [[Method overriding (programming)|overrides]] a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called [[dynamic dispatch]]. [[virtual functions|Virtual member functions]] or ''methods''<ref>{{Cite book |quote=A virtual member function is sometimes called a ''method''. |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |year=2000 |page=310 |title=The C++ Programming Language |edition=Special |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-70073-5 }}</ref> allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using [[virtual function table]]s. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]] before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.\n\nIn addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. As a rule of thumb, if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>clone()</syntaxhighlight> (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.\n\nA member function can also be made \"pure virtual\" by appending it with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>= 0</syntaxhighlight> after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an ''abstract class''. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.\n\n=== Lambda expressions ===\nC++ provides support for [[anonymous function]]s, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }\n</source>\n\nThe return type of a lambda expression can also be automatically inferred, if possible, e.g.:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[](int x, int y) { return x - y; } // inferred\n[](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; } // explicit\n</source>\n\nThe <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>[capture]</syntaxhighlight> list supports the definition of [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]]. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as [[syntactic sugar]] for an unnamed [[function object]].\n\n=== Exception handling ===\nException handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CandC++/lecture7.pdf|title = <nowiki>C and C++ Exceptions | Templates</nowiki>|date = 2013|accessdate = 30 August 2016|website = Cambridge Computer Laboratory - Course Materials 2013-14|publisher = |last = Mycroft|first = Alan}}</ref> It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.<ref name=\"exception_summary\">{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 345}}</ref> Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler.

In some cases, exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 349}}</ref>\n\nUnlike [[Signal handler|signal handling]], in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.\n\n== Standard library ==\n[[Image:ANSI ISO C++ WP.jpg|thumb|right|The draft \"Working Paper\" standard that became approved as C++98; half of its size was devoted to the C++ Standard Library]]\n{{Main|C++ Standard Library}}\nThe C++ [[standardization|standard]] consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types ([[sequence container (C++)#Vector|vectors]], lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), [[algorithm]]s (find, [[Foreach loop|for_each]], [[Binary search algorithm|binary_search]], random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities ([[iostream]], for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, [[smart pointers]] for automatic memory management, [[regular expression]] support, [[multithreading (software)|multi-threading]] library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ [[exception handling|exceptions]] into C++ exceptions, a [[random number generator]] and a slightly modified version of the [[C standard library]] (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\n\nA large part of the C++ library is based on the [[Standard Template Library]] (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include [[container (data structure)|container]]s as the collections of objects (such as [[array data structure|vector]]s and [[linked list|lists]]), [[iterator]]s that provide array-like access to containers, and [[algorithm]]s that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\n\nFurthermore, (multi)maps ([[associative array]]s) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the [[feature (software design)|feature]]s of the [[library (computing)|library]] are accessed by using the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>#include</syntaxhighlight> [[directive (programming)|directive]] to include a [[standard header]]. The [[C++ Standard Library]] provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.\n\nThe standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by [[Alexander Stepanov]], who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html |author=Graziano Lo Russo |title=An Interview with A.

As expressed by [[Joshua Bloch]]: <blockquote> I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, \u201cYes, we\u2019re using C++ but we\u2019re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we\u2019re not using operator overloading.\u201d There are just a bunch of features that you\u2019re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else\u2019s code, which I think is such a good thing. </blockquote>\n\n[[Donald Knuth]] (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of [[Edsger Dijkstra]] that \"to think of programming in C++\" \"would make him physically ill\":<ref name=\"dobbsKnuth\" /><ref name=\"knuth1993\" /> <blockquote> The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said \"OK, we'll do them both\". So the language is too baroque for my taste. </blockquote>\n\n[[Ken Thompson]], who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment:<ref name=\"Seibel2009\" /><ref name=\"gigamonkeysWordpress\" /> <blockquote> It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it\u2019s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it\u2019s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it\u2019s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it\u2019s not a good language to transport an algorithm\u2014to say, \u201cI wrote it; here, take it.\u201d It\u2019s way too big, way too complex. And it\u2019s obviously [[Design by committee|built by a committee]]. \nStroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said \u201cno\u201d to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn\u2019t cleanly designed\u2014it was just the union of everything that came along.

The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged [[#Standard library|standard library]].  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at [[Bell Labs]] since 1979 as an extension of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided [[High-level programming language|high-level features]] for program organization.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage |url=http://www.stroustrup.com |website=www.stroustrup.com}}</ref> [[C++20]] is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title = C++; Where it's heading |url=https://dzone.com/articles/c-where-is-it-heading-and-what-are-the-new-feature}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BjarneStroustrup.jpg|thumb|Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, in his AT&T New Jersey office c. 2000]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Danish [[computer scientist]], began work on \"{{visible anchor|C with [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]}}\", the predecessor to C++.<ref name=\"invention3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#invention|title = Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ: When was C++ invented?|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|website = stroustrup.com|date = 7 March 2010|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that [[Simula]] had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while [[BCPL]] was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in [[AT&T Bell Labs]], he had the problem of analyzing the [[Unix|UNIX]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with respect to [[distributed computing]]. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the [[C (programming language)|C]] language with [[Simula]]-like features.<ref name=\"evolving\">{{cite web |url = http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf|title = Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup}}\n</ref> C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including [[ALGOL 68]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]].\n\nInitially, Stroustrup's \"C with Classes\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including [[class (computer programming)|classes]], [[derived class]]es, [[strong typing]], [[inlining]] and [[default argument]]s.<ref name=\"hopl2\">{{cite web|last1=Stroustrup|first1=Bjarne|title=A History of C ++ : 1979\u2212 1991|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \"C++\" (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>++</syntaxhighlight> being the [[increment operator]] in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including [[virtual function]]s, function name and [[operator overloading]], references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight>). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, [[Cfront]].\n\nIn 1985, the first edition of ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]'' was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.<ref name=\"1st-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/1st.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = First|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.<ref name=\"invention3\"/>\n\nIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of ''The C++ Programming Language'' in 1991.<ref name=\"2nd-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/2nd.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = Second|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}</ref> New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, [[const correctness|const member functions]], and protected members. In 1990, ''The Annotated C++ Reference Manual'' was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included [[template (programming)|template]]s, [[exception handling|exceptions]], [[namespaces]], new [[cast (computer science)|cast]]s, and a [[Boolean datatype|Boolean type]].\n\n[[Image:20160121 CppFRUG Joel Falcou CppQuiz 3.jpg|thumb|left|A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015]]\n\nIn 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update ([[C++03]]) was released in 2003.\n\nAfter C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the [[C++11]] standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers.

The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard (though there are some rules defined below) to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation. More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that \"shall last for the duration of the program\".<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.1\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

First, \"static initialization\" is performed, and only ''after'' all static initialization is performed, \"dynamic initialization\" is performed.  In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or <code>constexpr</code>). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable.  Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with <code>constexpr</code>, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.\n\n==== Thread storage duration objects ====\nVariables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.2\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the ''reverse'' order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]].\n\nLocal variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|RAII]], which is widely used in C++.\n\nMember variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an \"automatic object\" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.\n\nTemporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the <code>;</code> at the end of a statement).\n\n==== Dynamic storage duration objects ====\n{{Main|new and delete (C++)}}\n\nThese objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to {{cpp|new}} and destroyed explicitly with a call to {{cpp|delete}}.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.4\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by ''instantiation'' at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \"[[Substitution failure is not an error]]\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for [[generic programming]], [[template metaprogramming]], and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., [[Generics in Java|Java]]) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.\n\nTemplates are different from [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]s: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] (see below) and [[generic programming]].\n\nIn addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C++ that is [[Turing-complete]], meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a [[template metaprogramming|template metaprogram]] prior to runtime.\n\nIn summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.\n\n=== Objects ===\n{{Main|C++ classes}}\n\nC++ introduces [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) features to C. It offers [[class (computer science)|class]]es, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[Information hiding|encapsulation]], [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], which in turn provide support for the [[Resource Acquisition is Initialization]] (RAII) concept.\n\n==== Encapsulation ====\n[[Information hiding|Encapsulation]] is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\"friends\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.\n\nThe object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as [[Modularity (programming)|modular programming]].\n\nIt is generally considered good practice to make all [[data]] private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.<ref name=\"cppcs\">{{Cite book |first1=Herb |last1=Sutter |first2=Andrei |last2=Alexandrescu |authorlink1=Herb Sutter |authorlink2=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2004 |title=C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices |publisher = Addison-Wesley }}</ref><ref name=\"industrialcpp\">{{Cite book |last1=Henricson |first1=Mats |last2=Nyquist |first2=Erik |title=Industrial Strength C++ |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1997 |isbn=0-13-120965-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/industrialstreng0000henr }}</ref>\n\n==== Inheritance ====\n[[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]] allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a [[base class]] may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \"inheritance\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \"class\" inherits privately, while a \"struct\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called [[virtual inheritance]]. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.\n\n[[Multiple inheritance]] is a C++ feature not found in most other languages, allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \"Flying Cat\" class can inherit from both \"Cat\" and \"Flying Mammal\". Some other languages, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an [[abstract base class]] or \"ABC\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called [[Dominance (C++)|dominance]].\n\n=== Operators and operator overloading ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0.5em 0 1em 2em;\"\n|+ Operators that cannot be overloaded\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Operator\n! style=\"width: 9em\" | Symbol\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Scope resolution operator\n| {{C-lang| ::}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Conditional operator\n| {{C-lang| ?:}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | dot operator\n| {{C-lang| .}}\n|-\n\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Member selection operator\n| {{C-lang| .*}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"sizeof\" operator\n| {{C-lang| sizeof}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"typeid\" operator\n| {{C-lang| typeid}}\n|}\n{{Main|Operators in C and C++}}\nC++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (<code>.</code> and <code>.*</code>) as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.\n\nOverloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as [[smart pointer]]s. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \"<code>&&</code>\" and \"<code>||</code>\" operators lose their [[short-circuit evaluation]] property.\n\n=== Polymorphism ===\n{{See also|Polymorphism (computer science)}}\n\n[[Type polymorphism|Polymorphism]] enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.\n\nC++ supports several kinds of ''static'' (resolved at [[compile-time]]) and ''dynamic'' (resolved at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]) [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]s, supported by the language features described above. [[Compile-time polymorphism]] does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while [[runtime polymorphism]] typically incurs a performance penalty.\n\n==== Static polymorphism ====\n{{See also|Parametric polymorphism|ad hoc polymorphism}}\n\n[[Function overloading]] allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. [[ad hoc polymorphism|''ad hoc'' polymorphism]]). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their [[Parameter (computer science)|formal parameter]]s. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compile-time error message.\n\nWhen declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a [[default arguments|default value]]. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.\n\n[[Generic programming#Templates|Templates]] in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. [[parametric polymorphism]]). In particular, through the [[curiously recurring template pattern]], it's possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and [[Turing-complete]], they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through [[template metaprogramming]]. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |accessdate=8 March 2010 |publisher=EmptyCrate Software.

This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types.\n\nC++ also provides the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type: ''downcasting''. The ''attempt'' is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (''Upcasting'', conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> relies on [[run-time type information]] (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> to a pointer fails, the result is the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>nullptr</syntaxhighlight> constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects ''known'' to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight>, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.\n\n===== Virtual member functions =====\nOrdinarily, when a function in a derived class [[Method overriding (programming)|overrides]] a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called [[dynamic dispatch]]. [[virtual functions|Virtual member functions]] or ''methods''<ref>{{Cite book |quote=A virtual member function is sometimes called a ''method''. |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |year=2000 |page=310 |title=The C++ Programming Language |edition=Special |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-70073-5 }}</ref> allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using [[virtual function table]]s. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]] before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.\n\nIn addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. As a rule of thumb, if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>clone()</syntaxhighlight> (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.\n\nA member function can also be made \"pure virtual\" by appending it with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>= 0</syntaxhighlight> after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an ''abstract class''. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.\n\n=== Lambda expressions ===\nC++ provides support for [[anonymous function]]s, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }\n</source>\n\nThe return type of a lambda expression can also be automatically inferred, if possible, e.g.:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[](int x, int y) { return x - y; } // inferred\n[](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; } // explicit\n</source>\n\nThe <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>[capture]</syntaxhighlight> list supports the definition of [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]]. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as [[syntactic sugar]] for an unnamed [[function object]].\n\n=== Exception handling ===\nException handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CandC++/lecture7.pdf|title = <nowiki>C and C++ Exceptions | Templates</nowiki>|date = 2013|accessdate = 30 August 2016|website = Cambridge Computer Laboratory - Course Materials 2013-14|publisher = |last = Mycroft|first = Alan}}</ref> It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.<ref name=\"exception_summary\">{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 345}}</ref> Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler.

This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 349}}</ref>\n\nUnlike [[Signal handler|signal handling]], in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.\n\n== Standard library ==\n[[Image:ANSI ISO C++ WP.jpg|thumb|right|The draft \"Working Paper\" standard that became approved as C++98; half of its size was devoted to the C++ Standard Library]]\n{{Main|C++ Standard Library}}\nThe C++ [[standardization|standard]] consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types ([[sequence container (C++)#Vector|vectors]], lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), [[algorithm]]s (find, [[Foreach loop|for_each]], [[Binary search algorithm|binary_search]], random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities ([[iostream]], for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, [[smart pointers]] for automatic memory management, [[regular expression]] support, [[multithreading (software)|multi-threading]] library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ [[exception handling|exceptions]] into C++ exceptions, a [[random number generator]] and a slightly modified version of the [[C standard library]] (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\n\nA large part of the C++ library is based on the [[Standard Template Library]] (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include [[container (data structure)|container]]s as the collections of objects (such as [[array data structure|vector]]s and [[linked list|lists]]), [[iterator]]s that provide array-like access to containers, and [[algorithm]]s that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\n\nFurthermore, (multi)maps ([[associative array]]s) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the [[feature (software design)|feature]]s of the [[library (computing)|library]] are accessed by using the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>#include</syntaxhighlight> [[directive (programming)|directive]] to include a [[standard header]]. The [[C++ Standard Library]] provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.\n\nThe standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by [[Alexander Stepanov]], who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html |author=Graziano Lo Russo |title=An Interview with A.

The downside of this decision is that [[object code]] produced by different [[compiler]]s is expected to be incompatible. There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or [[operating system]]s (for example C++ ABI),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/ |title=C++ ABI Summary |date=20 March 2001 |accessdate=30 May 2006 }}</ref> though they seem to be largely abandoned now.\n\n=== With C ===\n[[Image:C slash cpp.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|The relationship of C++ to C has always been a bit problematic]]\n{{Details|Compatibility of C and C++}}\n\nC++ is often considered to be a superset of [[C (programming language)|C]] but this is not strictly true.<ref name=\"superset\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#C-is-subset |title=Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ&nbsp;\u2013 Is C a subset of C++? |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>void*</syntaxhighlight> to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>new</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>class</syntaxhighlight>, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.\n\nSome incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard ([[C99]]), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight>) and declarations mixed with code.

As expressed by [[Joshua Bloch]]: <blockquote> I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, \u201cYes, we\u2019re using C++ but we\u2019re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we\u2019re not using operator overloading.\u201d There are just a bunch of features that you\u2019re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else\u2019s code, which I think is such a good thing. </blockquote>\n\n[[Donald Knuth]] (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of [[Edsger Dijkstra]] that \"to think of programming in C++\" \"would make him physically ill\":<ref name=\"dobbsKnuth\" /><ref name=\"knuth1993\" /> <blockquote> The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said \"OK, we'll do them both\". So the language is too baroque for my taste. </blockquote>\n\n[[Ken Thompson]], who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment:<ref name=\"Seibel2009\" /><ref name=\"gigamonkeysWordpress\" /> <blockquote> It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it\u2019s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it\u2019s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it\u2019s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it\u2019s not a good language to transport an algorithm\u2014to say, \u201cI wrote it; here, take it.\u201d It\u2019s way too big, way too complex. And it\u2019s obviously [[Design by committee|built by a committee]]. \nStroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said \u201cno\u201d to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn\u2019t cleanly designed\u2014it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that. </blockquote>\n\nHowever [[Brian Kernighan]], also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment:<ref>{{cite video|people=Brian Kernighan|date=July 18, 2018|title=Brian Kernighan Q&A - Computerphile|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhR8cUX90&t=5m17s}}</ref> <blockquote>C++ has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C++ is too big and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today, that we just use, are C++ programs. </blockquote>\n\nStroustrup himself comments that C++ semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: \"within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out\".<ref>http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that</ref>\n\nOther complaints may include a lack of [[reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] or [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], long compilation times, perceived [[feature creep]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.mx/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |year=2012 |last=Pike |first=Rob}}</ref> and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yosefk.com/c++fqa/defective.html|title=Defective C++|first=Yossi|last=Kreinin|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[List of C++ compilers]]\n* [[Outline of C++]]\n* [[:Category:C++ libraries|C++ Libraries (category)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |first=David |last=Abrahams |authorlink=David Abrahams (computer programmer) |first2=Aleksey |last2=Gurtovoy  |title=C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-22725-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Andrei |last=Alexandrescu |authorlink=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2001 |title=Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-70431-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Andrei |last=Alexandrescu |authorlink=Andrei Alexandrescu |first2=Herb |last2=Sutter |authorlink2=Herb Sutter|year=2004 |title=C++ Design and Coding Standards: Rules and Guidelines for Writing Programs |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-11358-6 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Pete |last=Becker |authorlink=Pete Becker |year=2006 |title=The C++ Standard Library Extensions : A Tutorial and Reference |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-41299-0 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Frank |last=Brokken |year=2010 |title=C++ Annotations |publisher=University of Groningen |isbn=90-367-0470-7 |url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/ }}\n* {{Cite book |first=James O. |last=Coplien |authorlink=James O.

It is populated by the Babirwa (Ba-Birwa) people who came from [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] in present-day [[South Africa]]. \n\n[[Northern Sotho language|Sebirwa]] or [[Birwa]], the language spoken by the Babirwa people, is a dialect of [[Northern Sotho]], along with Bididi, Lobedu, Kgaga, Hananwa, [[Pedi]], Phalaborwa, Pulana, Tshwapong, Kutswe, Phahladira, Pai, Kopa, Kubu, etc. [[Northern Sotho]] is one of three Sesotho subgroups of [[Basotho]]. The two others are Western Sotho (better known as Setswana, which is largely spoken in [[Botswana]]), [[North West Province]], a small number of people in Matebeland Province of [[Zimbabwe]] and Southern Sotho (spoken in [[Lesotho]], [[Free State (province)|Free State]], and Vaal). The Basotho came from [[Cornelia, Free State|Ntswanatsatsi]].\n\n== History ==\nBefore [[Moshoeshoe]] and his Basotho nation of Lesotho, [[Basotho]] people were there. Moshoshoe didn't found  Basotho but he founded a nation   made up of Sesotho speaking people from different Sesotho speaking clans in which the British imperialist in Southern Africa errenous called Basotho nation, [[Lesotho]] cutting them off from the rest of other Basothos outside Lesotho in [[Orange Free State]] and [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] in present day [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]] as if Moshoshoe and his people were unique from other Basotho people. Basotho people were there before [[Moshoshoe]] the son of Mokhachane of another Basotho clan of Bamokoteli clan united the smaller and weaker clans of Basothos under his [[Bakwena]] clan leadership during Shaka's war of difaqane. Moshoshoe and his Bakwena clan and the rest of the other Basotho clan originates from Ntswanatsatsi in present day [[South Africa]]. Families moved away from each other in Ntswanatsatsi and started clans using a totem as symbol of their clan (like crocodile (Kwena) which Moshoshoe' ancestors used) and different families moved to different directions within the precolonial South Africa under different leadership. Under different leadership some settled in the Western side, present day [[North West Province]] others spread around Ntswanatsatsi to the present day [Free State]] and Lesotho, others to present day [[Botswana]] others to present day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]], [[Namibia]] others  others moved  to the present day [[Gauteng]] in South Africa and they became patriarchs of the founding fathers of [[Bakgatla]] which also gave birth to [Northern Basotho]]  which in turn gave birth to different Northern clans with their dialects like [[BaPedi]] , Batlokwa,Babirwa, etc and others ended up in intermarriage with other tribes they moved next to and mingled with like Swatis, Vendas and Tsongas and Ngunis and in some places these Northern Basotho' Sotho was diluted by the influence of these tribe they found in the area, they moved into and lived alongside. This is what happened to a subgroup of Northern Basotho who end up becoming [[Mapulana]] with their Sesotho influenced by [[Swati]]. Also some of the Northern Basotho having a common denominator of \"apa\" (meaning talk) with Vendas, I mean Balovedu, BaGubu and [[Babirwa]] of [[Bobirwa]] in the Southern part of [[Botswana]] near the Zimbabwean border along the  Shashe river and with its dialect spoken on the other side of the border of Botswana in Zimbabwe.\n\nAfter the scattering of the Basothos from their cradle, different Basotho dialects from different locations within South Africa emerged and the Babirwa  people were one of those who emerged, coming out of Nareng in Letswalo area near [[Phalaborwa]] under the leadership of Tshukudu between 1510 and 1599. Babirwa moved from Nareng under their chief, They trekked further North and settled in Blauwberg in present-day [[Limpopo Province]]. Others remained in Blauwberg, living in surrounding areas such as [[Senwabarwana]]. Others who left Transvaal ended up in the southern part of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] near a place called [[Gwanda]] district in [[Matebeleland]] South. Gwanda was inhabited by Jahunda ([[Kalanga  dialect]]) speaking people and a group of Ndebele who moved southward from the Northern side of precolonial [[Matabeleland province]] which they invaded under their leader Mzilikazi who was forced by the Boers to leave Transvaal after running away from [[Shaka]] in [[Natal]] Other group of Babirwa left Bobirwa and joined their relatives who left Transvaal for Southern Zimbabwe when they left for Bobirwa.  \n\nNot all of Sothos of Zimbabwe are of Babirwa descent. The Babirwa from Zimbabwe are found in Gungwe, Ntalale, Tlhakadiyawa, Kafusi, Mawaza, Mafukung and surrounding villages. They are two types of Basotho in Zimbabwe, the Babirwa and the other Basothos who left Transvaal around the 1890s and early 1900 because they were displaced by the Boers and most of those Basothos came from Polokwane area, places like Moletse, Potgieterrus. Other Zimbabwean Sothos got [[Venda people|Venda]] and Tsonga  roots from [[Northern Transvaal]] present-day [[Limpopo Province]]. The Sotho of Zimbabwe which is similar to the Sesotho that is spoken in Messina and surrounding area is a corrupted [[Kubu language|Kubu]] and it is similar to Selobedu. From the above, it is clear that the Babirwa people also lived along the confluence of the Limpopo River and the [[Shashi River]], the area that today includes the Mapungubjwe Ruins. \n\nThe Babirwa in South Africa reside in areas north of the Bochum area, north of Polokwane. There are more than 40 Babirwa surnames in South Africa which include Sebone, Malema, Makhura, Makwati, Makhurane, Maphala, Nare, Tau, Tlou-Serope, [[Choshi]], Mmamadi, [[Legong]] (Lehong), Mangale, Taueatswala, Molefe, Mogano, Jibula (Tjibula) (Muhanu), [[Machete]], Lehomo, Raphahlelo, Raseokgo (Sebola), Phooko, Ramalepe, Boikanyo, Selema,  Morerwa (Murerwa) Makgatho, Maruatona, Monekwe (Monengwe), Madema Morebeng (Phosa) and many more. The word Bobirwa, therefore, means the land of (Babirwa) Ba-Birwa people.{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n\nA large number of Babirwa left the northern South African shore and ended up living in what is today called the Bobirwa Sub District which is an administrative region in eastern [[Botswana]], part of the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].\n[[Bobonong]] is the largest town and the headquarters of the sub-district. The sub-district is bounded by [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast and [[South Africa]] to the southeast. The [[Limpopo River]] forms the boundary with South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/y5744e/y5744e07.htm|title=Drought impact mitigation and prevention in the Limpopo River Basin|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Bobirwa Sub-district has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|300|to|400|mm}}. Soils are mainly loams to sandy clay loams. Bobirwa is the lowest part of Botswana, varying from {{convert|590|to|886|m}} above sea level. It is intersected by a network of channels that drain into the Limpopo. Villages include [[Mathathane]], [[Motlhabaneng]], [[Tsetsebjwe]], Kobojango, [[Bobonong]], [[Molalatau]], [[Tobane]], [[Mabolwe]], Semolale, [[Lepokole]], Zanzibar, Moletemane, [[Sefophe]] and Lentswelemoriti.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|pp=5-7}}\n\nThe sub-district has been heavily degraded by agricultural activities and is susceptible to drought. Large areas in and around the villages are bare earth caused by clearing grasses to keep snakes and insects away. Overgrazing by sheep, goats, donkeys, and cattle is also another cause.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|pp=5-7}} A study showed a substantial reduction in natural land cover between 1970 and 2010, combined with a significant increase in population.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|pp=9-10}}\n\nIn addition to livestock, the sub-district is home to abundant wildlife. In 2000, there was a herd of around 200 elephants.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|p=12}}\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that the government had approved the establishment of service centers in Tsetsebjwe, Mathathane, and Gobojango as well as other large infrastructure development projects such as road improvements, bridges, and electrification. This followed rapid economic growth in the previous three years. The local people could now shop and bank in Bobonong, rather than having to travel to [[Selebi-Phikwe]]. The new centers were expected to further improve access to services.{{sfn|Modikwa|2009}}\n\nIn 2012, there was a sharp increase in stock theft. This may have been caused by drought, which was forcing livestock to travel long distances to find grazing and water making them vulnerable to rustlers.{{sfn|Mazwiduma|2012}}\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n |ref=harv\n |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/fr/files/18416/11117683861pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc/pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc\n |title=BOTSWANA REPORT Contract No. 4500010375\n |work=UNESCO Crosscutting Project\n |author=Botswana College of Agriculture\n |date=4 August 2004\n |accessdate=2012-09-17\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104180221/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/fr/files/18416/11117683861pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc/pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc\n |archive-date=4 January 2016\n |url-status=dead\n }}\n*{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=876&dir=2012/June/Friday8\n |work=Mmegi\n |title=Stocktheft on the rise in Bobirwa\n |last=Mazwiduma|first=Takongwa |date=8 June 2012\n |accessdate=2012-09-17}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=12&dir=2009/January/Friday9\n |work=Mmegi\n |title=Massive infrastructural projects underway in Bobirwa\n |last=Modikwa |first=Onalenna |date=9 January 2009\n |accessdate=2012-09-17}} \n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Botswana]]\n[[Category:Central District (Botswana)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = Bobirwa\n| native_name             =\n| native_name_lang        = <!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"fr\" for French.

The [[Limpopo River]] forms the boundary with South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/y5744e/y5744e07.htm|title=Drought impact mitigation and prevention in the Limpopo River Basin|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Bobirwa Sub-district has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|300|to|400|mm}}. Soils are mainly loams to sandy clay loams. Bobirwa is the lowest part of Botswana, varying from {{convert|590|to|886|m}} above sea level. It is intersected by a network of channels that drain into the Limpopo. Villages include [[Mathathane]], [[Motlhabaneng]], [[Tsetsebjwe]], Kobojango, [[Bobonong]], [[Molalatau]], [[Tobane]], [[Mabolwe]], Semolale, [[Lepokole]], Zanzibar, Moletemane, [[Sefophe]] and Lentswelemoriti.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|pp=5-7}}\n\nThe sub-district has been heavily degraded by agricultural activities and is susceptible to drought. Large areas in and around the villages are bare earth caused by clearing grasses to keep snakes and insects away. Overgrazing by sheep, goats, donkeys, and cattle is also another cause.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|pp=5-7}} A study showed a substantial reduction in natural land cover between 1970 and 2010, combined with a significant increase in population.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|pp=9-10}}\n\nIn addition to livestock, the sub-district is home to abundant wildlife. In 2000, there was a herd of around 200 elephants.{{sfn|Botswana College of Agriculture|2004|p=12}}\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that the government had approved the establishment of service centers in Tsetsebjwe, Mathathane, and Gobojango as well as other large infrastructure development projects such as road improvements, bridges, and electrification. This followed rapid economic growth in the previous three years. The local people could now shop and bank in Bobonong, rather than having to travel to [[Selebi-Phikwe]]. The new centers were expected to further improve access to services.{{sfn|Modikwa|2009}}\n\nIn 2012, there was a sharp increase in stock theft. This may have been caused by drought, which was forcing livestock to travel long distances to find grazing and water making them vulnerable to rustlers.{{sfn|Mazwiduma|2012}}\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n |ref=harv\n |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/fr/files/18416/11117683861pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc/pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc\n |title=BOTSWANA REPORT Contract No. 4500010375\n |work=UNESCO Crosscutting Project\n |author=Botswana College of Agriculture\n |date=4 August 2004\n |accessdate=2012-09-17\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104180221/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/fr/files/18416/11117683861pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc/pilotproject_landcover_FinalReport.doc\n |archive-date=4 January 2016\n |url-status=dead\n }}\n*{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=876&dir=2012/June/Friday8\n |work=Mmegi\n |title=Stocktheft on the rise in Bobirwa\n |last=Mazwiduma|first=Takongwa |date=8 June 2012\n |accessdate=2012-09-17}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=12&dir=2009/January/Friday9\n |work=Mmegi\n |title=Massive infrastructural projects underway in Bobirwa\n |last=Modikwa |first=Onalenna |date=9 January 2009\n |accessdate=2012-09-17}} \n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Botswana]]\n[[Category:Central District (Botswana)]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toTransvaal(link changed toTransvaal Province) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobirwa"}

A [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]]]\n\n'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].\n\nIn the visual arts, [[illusionism (art)|illusionistic]] realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be \"realist\" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist pointers rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th Century]].\n\nThere have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]].\n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, d\u00e9tail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such \"realism\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \"veristic\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \"realistic\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \"realist\" is often useful, as is the term \"illusionistic\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&pg=PA7&dq=Realism+painting&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Realism%20painting&f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6\u20139, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0|978-3-8228-2942-4}}</ref><ref>Finocchio, Ross. \"Nineteenth-Century French Realism\".

It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.\n[[File:Eyckbaptism.png|thumb|''Bas-de-page'' of the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', \"Hand G\" ([[Jan van Eyck]]?), [[Turin-Milan Hours]]. An advanced illusionistic work for c. 1425, with the dove of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the sky.]]\n\nThe art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.\n\nThe accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \"realism\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].\n\n{{anchor|Naturalism}}\n\n===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===\n[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]\n\nThe depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.\n\nEarly Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.\n[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]\n\nIn the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Vel\u00e1zquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.\n\nMuch art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.\n\nMedieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.\n\n[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:El almuerzo, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg| [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]'', c. 1620\nFile:Brouwer, Adriaen - Interior of a Tavern - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Adriaen Brouwer]], ''Interior of a Tavern'', c. 1630\nFile:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Interior of a Tailor's Shop - WGA03175.jpg|[[Quiringh van Brekelenkam]], ''Interior of a Tailor's Shop'', 1653\nFile:Giacomo Ceruti - Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School) - WGA4672.jpg|[[Giacomo Ceruti]], ''Women Working on Pillow Lace'', 1720s\nFile:Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin 017.jpg|[[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], ''Woman Cleaning Turnips'', c. 1738, [[Alte Pinakothek]].<ref>Chardin served as a forerunner to the Realist movement in French painting. \"Without realizing he was doing it, he rejected his own time and opened the door to modernity\".

Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.\n\n[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889]]\nA recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was \"realism\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.\n\nRenaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.<ref>Blunt, 30\u201332, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo</ref> [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,<ref>Blunt, 14\u201320</ref> with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful \u2013 he refused to make portraits for that reason.<ref>Blunt, 59\u201364</ref>\n\n[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905\u201306, ''[[Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve|Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]\nIn the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \"classical-idealism\" of [[the Carracci]] and the \"naturalist\" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \"naturalist\" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\" (''naturalisti'').<ref>\"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti\", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century \"Naturalism\" or the \"'''Naturalist school'''\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: \"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\".<ref name=\"Needham\">Needham</ref> [[\u00c9mile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\nThe term \"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as \"Naturalist\", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Pieta z Lubiaza.jpg|Late Gothic ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' from [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] in [[Lower Silesia]], [[Poland]], now in National Museum in [[Warsaw]]\nFile:Raffaelli Pariser Vorstadt.JPG|[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], ''Outskirts of Paris'', 1880s\nFile:Fallen Monarchs 1886 by William Bliss Baker.jpg|[[William Bliss Baker]], American Naturalist painter, ''Fallen Monarchs'', 1886\nFile:Pekka Halonen - Tienraivaajia Karjalassa.jpg|[[Pekka Halonen]], [[Finland|Finnish]] Naturalist, ''Pioneers in [[Karelia]]'', 1900\n</gallery>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Literary realism}}\nBroadly defined as \"the faithful representation of reality\",<ref>{{cite web|author=Donna M.

Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].\n\nIn the visual arts, [[illusionism (art)|illusionistic]] realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be \"realist\" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].\n\nThere have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. \n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, d\u00e9tail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such \"realism\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \"veristic\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \"realistic\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \"realist\" is often useful, as is the term \"illusionistic\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&pg=PA7&dq=Realism+painting&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Realism%20painting&f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6\u20139, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0|978-3-8228-2942-4}}</ref><ref>Finocchio, Ross. \"Nineteenth-Century French Realism\".

It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.\n[[File:Eyckbaptism.png|thumb|''Bas-de-page'' of the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', \"Hand G\" ([[Jan van Eyck]]?), [[Turin-Milan Hours]]. An advanced illusionistic work for c. 1425, with the dove of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the sky.]]\n\nThe art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.\n\nThe accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \"realism\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].\n\n{{anchor|Naturalism}}\n\n===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===\n[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]\n\nThe depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.\n\nEarly Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.\n[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]\n\nIn the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Vel\u00e1zquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.\n\nMuch art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.\n\nMedieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.\n\n[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:El almuerzo, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg| [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]'', c. 1620\nFile:Brouwer, Adriaen - Interior of a Tavern - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Adriaen Brouwer]], ''Interior of a Tavern'', c. 1630\nFile:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Interior of a Tailor's Shop - WGA03175.jpg|[[Quiringh van Brekelenkam]], ''Interior of a Tailor's Shop'', 1653\nFile:Giacomo Ceruti - Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School) - WGA4672.jpg|[[Giacomo Ceruti]], ''Women Working on Pillow Lace'', 1720s\nFile:Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin 017.jpg|[[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], ''Woman Cleaning Turnips'', c. 1738, [[Alte Pinakothek]].<ref>Chardin served as a forerunner to the Realist movement in French painting. \"Without realizing he was doing it, he rejected his own time and opened the door to modernity\".

In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art.

Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.\n\n[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889]]\nA recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was \"realism\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.\n\nRenaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.<ref>Blunt, 30\u201332, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo</ref> [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,<ref>Blunt, 14\u201320</ref> with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful \u2013 he refused to make portraits for that reason.<ref>Blunt, 59\u201364</ref>\n\n[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905\u201306, ''[[Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve|Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]\nIn the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \"classical-idealism\" of [[the Carracci]] and the \"naturalist\" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \"naturalist\" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\" (''naturalisti'').<ref>\"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti\", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century \"Naturalism\" or the \"'''Naturalist school'''\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: \"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\".<ref name=\"Needham\">Needham</ref> [[\u00c9mile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\nThe term \"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as \"Naturalist\", although the term is rarely used of British painting.
