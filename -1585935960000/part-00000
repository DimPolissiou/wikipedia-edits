The battle took place against a background of a long-running enmity between the Cuncos and Spanish dating back to the [[Destruction of the Seven Cities|destruction of Osorno]] in 1603. More immediate causes were the killing of Spanish shipwreck survivors and looting of the cargo by Cuncos which led to Spanish desire's for a punishment combined with lucrative slave raiding. \n\nWhile Cuncos and [[Jesuit]]s made attempts to placate the mood of war, [[maestre de campo]] [[Salazar brothers|Juan de Salazar]] eventually convinced Governor of Chile [[Francisco Antonio de Acu\u00f1a Cabrera y Bayona|Antonio de Acu\u00f1a Cabrera]] to authorise and support his expedition. The battle was fought across [[Bueno River]] where Cuncos and Huilliches repelled Spanish attempts to cross the river, ending up with hundreds of Spanish troops drowned or killed. The battle contributed to the eventual [[Mapuche uprising of 1655]], in which many Spanish settlements and haciendas were ravaged. \n\nThe Battle of R\u00edo Bueno along with the subsequent events led to a [[crisis#Political|political crisis]] among the Spanish in Chile with a risk of [[civil war]]. The severity of the crisis made [[Miguel Luis Amun\u00e1tegui]] list it among the precursors to the [[Chilean War of Independence|Independence of Chile]]. The Cuncos and Huilliches south of Bueno River these tribes remained ''de facto'' independent until the late 18th century.\n\n==Background==\n===Renewed Cunco-Spanish conflict===\n{{Location map+|Chile|float=right|width=300|caption=The location of Spanish settlements and forts within the modern boundaries of Chile and Argentina.

blaming Juan de Salazar for his recklessness, his sister [[Juana de Salazar]], who was the wife of the governor, arranged for witnesses to justify her brother's conduct.<ref name=Barana348/>

It was named for the then [[Governor of Virginia]] (1796\u201399), [[James Wood (governor)|James Wood]], formerly a brigadier general in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1861, Virginia seceded from the Union. The delegates of the 40 western counties who opposed secession formed their own government and seceded from the Confederate state of Virginia. West Virginia was granted statehood in 1863.\n\nLater that year, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  Wood County was divided into ten districts: Clay, Harris, Lubeck, Parkersburg, Slate, Steele, Tygart, Union, Walker, and Williams.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|377|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|366|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|11|sqmi}} (2.8%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 31, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\nWood County's northern and western boundary is the [[Ohio River]].

It was named for the then [[Governor of Virginia]] (1796\u201399), [[James Wood (governor)|James Wood]], formerly a brigadier general in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1861, Virginia seceded from the Union. The delegates of the 40 western counties who opposed secession formed their own government and seceded from the Confederate state of Virginia. West Virginia was granted statehood in 1863.\n\nLater that year, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W.
