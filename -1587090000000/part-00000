It was the first tour with original members [[Peter Criss]] and [[Ace Frehley]] since their 1979 [[Dynasty Tour]]. The tour grossed $143.7 million, making it the most successful Kiss tour to date. Average attendance was 14,000.\n\nThe reunion tour prompted many 80's metal bands to also do reunion tours, however KISS' was the first and most successful.\n\nShows included the June 15 warmup gig in [[Irvine, California]], during which a stray firework ignited part of the stage; the August 8 show in [[Cincinnati]], where a fan threw his prosthetic leg on stage, which all the members signed and handed back to him; the January 22 show in [[Osaka]], Japan, where [[Gene Simmons]] lost his voice, [[Paul Stanley]] and Ace Frehley had to sing most of the songs; and the April 5 show in [[Columbus, Georgia]], where, due to health reasons, Peter Criss could not perform, and because the group decided to not cancel the show since the doors were already open, Criss's drum tech Eddie Kanon took the stage in Criss's \"cat\" make-up.\nThere was a short set played for MTV Music Awards before starting the US second leg, on September 4 at Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. Setlist for the show: \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" / \"[[New York Groove]]\" / \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\" / \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\" / \"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\".\n\nThe setlists for the tour drew almost exclusively from the band's 1970s heyday and did not include any songs from their non-make-up era. Only one song from the band's 1980s catalogue (\"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" from ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'') was played. The band did this because they believed that since they were touring with their original lineup, they should be faithful to the era with the material performed. {{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Alice in Chains]] were among many of the supporting acts on this tour. This would turn out to be their last tour featuring late vocalist [[Layne Staley]] with the final live appearance being on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus. Layne would never perform live again and lived in isolation until his death on April 5, 2002.\n\n==Typical setlist==\n\n#\"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\"\n#\"King of the Night Time World\"\n#\"Do You Love Me?\"\n#\"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\"\n#\"[[Cold Gin (song)|Cold Gin]]\"\n#\"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\"\n#\"[[Shout It Out Loud (Kiss song)|Shout It Out Loud]]\"\n#\"Watchin' You\"\n#\"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\"\n#\"[[Strutter]]\"\n#\"[[Shock Me]]\" (Ace Frehley guitar solo)\n#\"Rock Bottom\"\n#\"[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]\" (Gene Simmons bass solo, spits blood and flies), (Peter Criss drum solo)\n#\"[[New York Groove]]\"\n#\"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\"\n#\"100,000 Years\"\n#\"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\"\n'''Encore'''\n#<li value=18>\"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\"\n#\"[[Detroit Rock City]]\"\n#\"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\"\n\nOther songs played included \"Take Me\", \"I Stole Your Love\", \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\", \"[[C'mon and Love Me]]\", \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\", \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", and \"[[2,000 Man]]\".\n\n==Notable Shows==\n<ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997-0705.php</ref><ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-reunion-show/</ref><ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php</ref>\n\n'''June 15, 1996 KROQ Weenie Roast, Irvine Ca'''\n\nThis show was a practice gig for the band in front of a live audience before the official beginning of the tour. This show was for the band to work out the kinks in their complex live show. During the show multiple things went wrong, for example Ace Frehley's guitar went silent in the middle of the set. \n\n'''June 28, 1996 Tiger Stadium, Detroit Mi'''\n\nThis was the first official show with the reunited band in 17 years, and this was the show that kicked off the highly successful Alive Worldwide Tour. Initially the band wanted to start the tour off at a smaller venue, but their manager, Doc McGee booked the massive baseball stadium for the first gig. This ended up being a very fitting venue for the beginning of Kiss' comeback, because the city of Detroit always had special significance to the band, which is why Kiss wrote a song titled \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", which is one of their most well known songs, getting regular airplay on classic rock radio stations. The move to open the tour at Tiger Stadium in Detroit Rock City proved to be a good one, because the show sold out in a record time of 45 minutes, which is very impressive considering the fact that the band sold 39,867 tickets in under an hour without online ticket sales. \n\n'''June 25-28, 1996 Madison Square Garden, New York City Ny'''\n\nWhen the band went to schedule dates in their home town of New York City, they found out that just one night at the world famous Madison Square Garden arena was simply not enough, so they played four sold out consecutive nights at MSG and likely could have done another if the arena hadn't been occupied the next night. \n\n'''September 4, 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, Brooklyn Ny'''\n\nIn 1996 Kiss was riding on success as if it were 1977 again, and were scheduled to preform on the MTV Video Music Awards as a way to help further promote themselves, but in typical Kiss fashion, they weren't just going to play on any stage, they were intending on playing a show under the Statue of Liberty, but couldn't make a deal with the city of New York, so last minute the concert location was changed to a port right next to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Kiss played a 20 minute set to an audience of whoever showed up to watch them under the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge, however only the first song, Rock n Roll All Nite was broadcast on TV. Since the band was playing outdoors at an unofficial venue, without as many regulations, the band added loads of pyrotechnics, fireworks, and confetti. The complete show can be seen on Kiss' dvd boxset Kissology III.\n\n==Tour dates==\n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kissconcerthistory.com/ |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed |website=kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1996 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1997 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kissfanshop.de/Tourdates/TourdatesReunion.htm|title=KISS TOURDATES Alive Worldwide 1996\u201397|website=www.kissfanshop.de}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=tour:(Alive/Worldwide) |title=Search for setlists: tour:(Alive/Worldwide) &#124; setlist.fm |website=www.setlist.fm |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"175\"| Opening Act(s)\n! width=\"200\"| Attendance \n\n\n|-\n|June 15, 1996||[[Irvine, California]]||[[United States]]||[[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre]]  [[KROQ Weenie Roast]] || [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] || 15,416 *sold out*\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|North America \n|-\n|June 28, 1996||[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]||rowspan=\"24\"|United States||[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] || [[Alice in Chains]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] || 39,867 *sold out*\n|-\n|June 30, 1996||[[Louisville, Kentucky]]||[[Freedom Hall]] || rowspan=\"3\"|Alice in Chains || 15,891 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 2, 1996||[[St. Louis, Missouri]]||[[Kiel Center]] || 16,310 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 3, 1996||[[Kansas City, Missouri]]||[[Kemper Arena]] || 13,226 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 5, 1996||[[Dallas, Texas]]||[[Reunion Arena]] || rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pushmonkey]] || 14,637 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 6, 1996||[[Houston, Texas]]||[[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] || 12,955 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 7, 1996||[[San Antonio, Texas]]||[[Alamodome]] || 18,337 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 9, 1996||[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]||[[Louisiana Superdome]] || rowspan=\"5\"|[[The Melvins]] || 16,308 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 10, 1996||[[Memphis, Tennessee]]||[[Pyramid Arena]] || 16,807 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 12, 1996||[[Moline, Illinois]]||[[MARK of the Quad Cities]] || 10,349 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 13, 1996||[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]||[[St. Paul Civic Center]] || 15,234 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 14, 1996||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont, Illinois]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont Horizon]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || rowspan=\"3\"|[[The Nixons]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 17, 1996||[[Fairborn, Ohio]]||[[Ervin J.

It was the first tour with original members [[Peter Criss]] and [[Ace Frehley]] since their 1979 [[Dynasty Tour]]. The tour grossed $143.7 million, making it the most successful Kiss tour to date. Average attendance was 14,000.\n\nThe reunion tour prompted many 80's metal bands to also do reunion tours, however KISS' was the first and most successful.\n\nShows included the June 15 warmup gig in [[Irvine, California]], during which a stray firework ignited part of the stage; the August 8 show in [[Cincinnati]], where a fan threw his prosthetic leg on stage, which all the members signed and handed back to him; the January 22 show in [[Osaka]], Japan, where [[Gene Simmons]] lost his voice, [[Paul Stanley]] and Ace Frehley had to sing most of the songs; and the April 5 show in [[Columbus, Georgia]], where, due to health reasons, Peter Criss could not perform, and because the group decided to not cancel the show since the doors were already open, Criss's drum tech Eddie Kanon took the stage in Criss's \"cat\" make-up.\nThere was a short set played for MTV Music Awards before starting the US second leg, on September 4 at Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. Setlist for the show: \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" / \"[[New York Groove]]\" / \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\" / \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\" / \"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\".\n\nThe setlists for the tour drew almost exclusively from the band's 1970s heyday and did not include any songs from their non-make-up era. Only one song from the band's 1980s catalogue (\"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" from ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'') was played. The band did this because they believed that since they were touring with their original lineup, they should be faithful to the era with the material performed. {{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Alice in Chains]] were among many of the supporting acts on this tour. This would turn out to be their last tour featuring late vocalist [[Layne Staley]] with the final live appearance being on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus. Layne would never perform live again and lived in isolation until his death on April 5, 2002.\n\n==Typical setlist==\n\n#\"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\"\n#\"King of the Night Time World\"\n#\"Do You Love Me?\"\n#\"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\"\n#\"[[Cold Gin (song)|Cold Gin]]\"\n#\"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\"\n#\"[[Shout It Out Loud (Kiss song)|Shout It Out Loud]]\"\n#\"Watchin' You\"\n#\"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\"\n#\"[[Strutter]]\"\n#\"[[Shock Me]]\" (Ace Frehley guitar solo)\n#\"Rock Bottom\"\n#\"[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]\" (Gene Simmons bass solo, spits blood and flies), (Peter Criss drum solo)\n#\"[[New York Groove]]\"\n#\"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\"\n#\"100,000 Years\"\n#\"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\"\n'''Encore'''\n#<li value=18>\"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\"\n#\"[[Detroit Rock City]]\"\n#\"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\"\n\nOther songs played included \"Take Me\", \"I Stole Your Love\", \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\", \"[[C'mon and Love Me]]\", \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\", \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", and \"[[2,000 Man]]\".\n\n==Notable Shows==\n<ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997-0705.php</ref><ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-reunion-show/</ref><ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php</ref>\n\n'''June 15, 1996 KROQ Weenie Roast, Irvine Ca'''\n\nThis show was a practice gig for the band in front of a live audience before the official beginning of the tour. This show was for the band to work out the kinks in their complex live show. During the show multiple things went wrong, for example Ace Frehley's guitar went silent in the middle of the set. \n\n'''June 28, 1996 Tiger Stadium, Detroit Mi'''\n\nThis was the first official show with the reunited band in 17 years, and this was the show that kicked off the highly successful Alive Worldwide Tour. Initially the band wanted to start the tour off at a smaller venue, but their manager, Doc McGee booked the massive baseball stadium for the first gig. This ended up being a very fitting venue for the beginning of Kiss' comeback, because the city of Detroit always had special significance to the band, which is why Kiss wrote a song titled \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", which is one of their most well known songs, getting regular airplay on classic rock radio stations. The move to open the tour at Tiger Stadium in Detroit Rock City proved to be a good one, because the show sold out in a record time of 45 minutes, which is very impressive considering the fact that the band sold 39,867 tickets in under an hour without online ticket sales. \n\n'''June 25-28, 1996 Madison Square Garden, New York City Ny'''\n\nWhen the band went to schedule dates in their home town of New York City, they found out that just one night at the world famous Madison Square Garden arena was simply not enough, so they played four sold out consecutive nights at MSG and likely could have done another if the arena hadn't been occupied the next night. \n\n'''September 4, 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, Brooklyn Ny'''\n\nIn 1996 Kiss was riding on success as if it were 1977 again, and were scheduled to preform on the MTV Video Music Awards as a way to help further promote themselves, but in typical Kiss fashion, they weren't just going to play on any stage, they were intending on playing a show under the Statue of Liberty, but couldn't make a deal with the city of New York, so last minute the concert location was changed to a port right next to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Kiss played a 20 minute set to an audience of whoever showed up to watch them under the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge, however only the first song, Rock n Roll All Nite was broadcast on TV. Since the band was playing outdoors at an unofficial venue, without as many regulations, the band added loads of pyrotechnics, fireworks, and confetti. The complete show can be seen on Kiss' dvd boxset Kissology III.\n\n==Tour dates==\n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kissconcerthistory.com/ |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed |website=kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1996 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1997 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kissfanshop.de/Tourdates/TourdatesReunion.htm|title=KISS TOURDATES Alive Worldwide 1996\u201397|website=www.kissfanshop.de}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=tour:(Alive/Worldwide) |title=Search for setlists: tour:(Alive/Worldwide) &#124; setlist.fm |website=www.setlist.fm |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"175\"| Opening Act(s)\n! width=\"200\"| Attendance \n\n\n|-\n|June 15, 1996||[[Irvine, California]]||[[United States]]||[[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre - KROQ Weenie Roast]] || [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] || 15,416 *sold out*\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|North America \n|-\n|June 28, 1996||[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]||rowspan=\"24\"|United States||[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] || [[Alice in Chains]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] || 39,867 *sold out*\n|-\n|June 30, 1996||[[Louisville, Kentucky]]||[[Freedom Hall]] || rowspan=\"3\"|Alice in Chains || 15,891 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 2, 1996||[[St. Louis, Missouri]]||[[Kiel Center]] || 16,310 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 3, 1996||[[Kansas City, Missouri]]||[[Kemper Arena]] || 13,226 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 5, 1996||[[Dallas, Texas]]||[[Reunion Arena]] || rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pushmonkey]] || 14,637 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 6, 1996||[[Houston, Texas]]||[[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] || 12,955 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 7, 1996||[[San Antonio, Texas]]||[[Alamodome]] || 18,337 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 9, 1996||[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]||[[Louisiana Superdome]] || rowspan=\"5\"|[[The Melvins]] || 16,308 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 10, 1996||[[Memphis, Tennessee]]||[[Pyramid Arena]] || 16,807 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 12, 1996||[[Moline, Illinois]]||[[MARK of the Quad Cities]] || 10,349 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 13, 1996||[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]||[[St. Paul Civic Center]] || 15,234 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 14, 1996||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont, Illinois]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont Horizon]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || rowspan=\"3\"|[[The Nixons]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 17, 1996||[[Fairborn, Ohio]]||[[Ervin J.

Also hard hit was the manufacturing of durable goods like automobiles and appliances, whose purchase consumers could postpone. The economy hit bottom in the winter of 1932\u201333; then came four years of growth until the [[recession of 1937\u201338]] brought back high levels of unemployment.<ref>Chandler (1970); Jensen (1989); Mitchell (1964)</ref>\n\n[[File:Real GDP of the United States from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|US annual real GDP from 1910 to 1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u20131939) highlighted]]\n[[File:US Unemployment from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|300px|Unemployment rate in the US 1910\u201360, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u201339) highlighted; accurate data begins in 1939, represented by a blue line.]]\n\nThe Depression caused major political changes in America. Three years into the depression, President [[Herbert Hoover]], widely shamed for not doing enough to combat the crisis, lost the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]] to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by an embarrassingly wide margin. Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the [[New Deal]], instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nThe Depression also resulted in an increase of [[emigration]] for the first time in American history. Some immigrants went back to their native countries, and some native U.S. citizens went to [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. There were mass migrations of people from badly hit areas in the [[Great Plains]] (the [[Okies]]) and the South to places such as California and the cities of the North (the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]).<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/afctshtml/tsme.html The Migrant Experience].

Retrieved on 2013-07-14.</ref> Racial tensions also increased during this time. By the 1940s immigration had returned to normal, and emigration declined. A well-known example of an emigrant was [[Frank McCourt]], who went to [[Ireland]], as recounted in his book ''[[Angela's Ashes]]''.\n\nThe memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns, such as the use of [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus packages]], [[Keynesian economics]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. It also shaped modern American literature, resulting in famous novels such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.\n\nExamining the [[causes of the Great Depression]] raises multiple issues: what factors set off the first downturn in 1929; what structural weaknesses and specific events turned it into a major depression; how the downturn spread from country to country; and why the economic recovery was so prolonged.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Defining Moment: The Great Depression and the American Economy in the Twentieth Century |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-226-06589-2 |editor-last=Bordo |editor-first=Michael D. |editor-link=Michael D.

There was no [[FDIC|federal deposit insurance]] during that time as [[Bank failure|bank failures]] were considered a normal part of economic life. Worried depositors started to withdraw savings, so the [[money multiplier]] worked in reverse. Banks were forced to liquidate assets (such as calling in loans rather than creating new loans).<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\">Robert Fuller (2012), ''Phantom of Fear: The Banking Panic of 1933'', pp. 241\u201342 fn. 45</ref> This caused the [[money supply]] to shrink and the economy to contract (the [[Great Contraction]]), resulting in a significant decline in aggregate investment.

However, the high interest also inhibited domestic business borrowing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nThe U.S. interest rates were also affected by [[France]]'s decision to raise their interest rates to attract gold to their vaults. In theory, the U.S. would have two potential responses to that: Allow the [[exchange rate]] to adjust, or increase their own interest rates to maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into [[Franc|francs]] to buy more French assets, the demand for the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] fell, and the exchange rate increased.

It began on October 24, 1929, and was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States. Much of the stock market crash can be attributed to exuberance and false expectations. In the years leading up to 1929, the rising stock market prices had created vast sums of wealth in relation to amounts invested, in turn encouraging borrowing to further buy more stock. However, on October 24 (Black Thursday), share prices began to fall and panic selling caused prices to fall sharply. On October 29 (Black Tuesday), share prices fell by $14 billion in a single day, more than $30 billion in the week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/economic-forces/the-economic-causes-and-impacts-of-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929-fall-2012|title=The Economic Causes and Impacts of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (Fall 2012) - Historpedia|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> The value that evaporated that week was ten times more than the entire federal budget and more than all of what the U.S. had spent on [[World War I]].

After the stock market crash and the bank closures, people were afraid of losing more money. Because of their fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted the American economy.\n\n==Banking failures==\n\nA large contribution to the [[recession]] was the closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. Financial institutions failed for several reasons, including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the [[Gold standard]], [[consumer confidence]] in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compounding issues the banking system struggled to keep up with the public's increasing demand for cash withdrawals. This overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to [[short sale (real estate)]] and [[liquidation]] of existing loans.<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\" /> In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis began with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931. By October 1931 over 2100 banks were suspended with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District, with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended.<ref>\"Banking Panics (1930\u20131933).\" Encyclopedia of the Great Depression. Encyclopedia.com. 13 Jun. 2017<http://www.encyclopedia.com>.</ref> The economy as a whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933. \n[[File:Banking_Closure_in_1929_-_New_York_City.jpg|thumb|People outside a closed bank after 1929 stock market crash.]]\n\nThe closures resulted in a massive withdrawal of deposits by millions of Americans estimated at near $6.8 billion (equivalent to around $60 billion in today's dollars). During this time the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) was not in place resulting in a loss of roughly $1.36 billion (or 20%) of the total $6.8 billion accounted for within the failed banks. These losses came directly from everyday individuals' savings, investments and bank accounts. As a result, [[GDP]] fell from the high seven-hundreds in 1929 to the low to mid six-hundreds in 1933 before seeing any recovery for the first time in nearly 4 years.<ref>USA annual GDP from 1910-60, in billions of constant 2005 dollars, with the years of the [[Great Depression]] (1929\u20131939) highlighted. Based on data from: Louis D. Johnston and Samuel H. Williamson, \"What Was the U.S. GDP Then?\" MeasuringWorth, 2008</ref> Federal leadership intervention is highly debated on its effectiveness and overall participation. The [[Federal Reserve Act]] could not effectively tackle the banking crisis as state bank and trust companies were not compelled to be a member, paper eligible discount member banks heavily restricted access to the Federal Reserve, power between the twelve Federal Reserve banks was decentralized and federal level leadership was ineffective, inexperienced, and weak.\n\n===Unregulated growth===\n\nThroughout the early 1900s banking regulations were extremely lax if not non-existent. The Currency Act of 1900 lowered the required [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of investors from 50,000 to 25,000 to create a [[national bank]]. As a result of this change nearly two thirds of the banks formed over the next ten years were quite small, averaging just above the 25,000 in required capital.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-41. Web. 2005</ref> The number of banks would nearly double (number of banks divided by Real GDP) from 1890 to 1920 due to the lack of oversight and qualification when banking [[charter]]s were being issued in the first two decades of the 1900s.<ref>(Federal Reserve Board 1933, 63\u201365).</ref>\n\nThe unregulated growth of small rural banking institutions can be partially attributed to the rising cost of [[agriculture]] especially in the [[Corn Belt]] and [[Cotton Belt]]. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply the needed capital to meet the farm [[commodity market]], however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising from 1887 to 1920 with an average of 6 percent growth in [GDP]. In particular the participation in [[World War I]] drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level which, in turn, resulted in a more lax approach in the lending process. Over banked conditions existed which pressured struggling banks to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market.<ref>Federal Reserve Board 1933, 67.</ref> Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result. \n[[File:Dust storm approaching Stratford, Texas 1935.jpg|thumb|Approaching dust storm near Stratford, Texas. April 18, 1935.]]\nCrop failures beginning in 1921 began to impact this poorly regulated system, the expansion areas of corn and cotton suffered the largest due to the [[dust bowl]] era resulting in real estate value reductions. In addition, the year 1921 was the peak for banking expansion with roughly 31,000 banks in activity, however, with the failures at the agricultural level 505 banks would close between 1921 -1930 marking the largest banking system failure on record.  Regulatory questions began to hit the debating table around banking qualifications as a result; discussions would continue into the [Great Depression] as not only were banks failing but some would disappear altogether with no rhyme or reason.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-53. Web. 21 May 2017.</ref> The panic of financial crisis would increase in the Great Depression due to the lack of confidence in the regulatory and recovery displayed during the 1920s, this ultimately drove a nation of doubts, uneasiness, and lack of consumer confidence in the banking system.\n\n===Contagion===\n\nWith a lack of consumer confidence in the economic direction given by the federal government panic started to spread across the country shortly after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. President Hoover retained the [[Gold Standard]] as the country's currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. [[Europe]]'s decision to move away from the [[Gold Standard]] caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to hoard gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months.  Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic began to set in. Contagion spread like wild fire pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits ''en masse''. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced banking failure took a mild recession to a major recession.<ref>Richardson, Gary. \"Banking Panics of 1930\u201331\". Federal Reserve History. N.p., 22 Nov. 2013. Web. 13 June 2017</ref>\n\nWhether this caused the Great Depression is still heavily debated due to many other attributing factors. However, it is evident that the banking system suffered massive reductions across the country due to the lack of consumer confidence. As withdraw requests would exceed cash availability banks began conducting steed discount sales such as fire sales and short sales. Due to the inability to immediately determine current value worth these fire sales and short sales would result in massive losses when recuperating any possible revenue for outstanding and defaulted loans.

Residents lived in the shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the [[Democratic National Committee]], to refer sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies Michelson blamed for the depression.<ref>Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88</ref>\n\nThe government did not calculate unemployment rates in the 1930s. The most widely accepted estimates of unemployment rates for the Great Depression are those by Stanley Lebergott from the 1950s. He estimated that unemployment reached 24.9 percent in the worst days of 1933. Another commonly cited estimate is by Michael Darby in 1976. He put the unemployment rate at a peak of 22.5 percent in 1932.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smiley |first1=Gene |title=Recent Unemployment Rate Estimates for the 1920s and 1930s |url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/2120839.pdf |website=wisc.edu |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Job losses were less severe among women, workers in non durable industries (such as food and clothing), services and sales workers, and those employed by the government. Unskilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates. Age also played a factor. Young people had a hard time getting their first job. Men over the age of 45, if they lost their job, would rarely find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were not, and they fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration in the 1920s that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities suddenly reversed itself. Unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.<ref>Richard J. Jensen, \"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553\u2013583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954 in JSTOR]; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]</ref>  City governments in 1930\u201331 tried to meet the depression by expanding [[Public works|public works projects]], as President Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However, tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931; no one was able to provide significant additional relief. People fell back on the cheapest possible relief, including soup kitchens providing free meals to anyone who showed up.<ref>Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)</ref> After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.\n\nThe federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by President Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis. The [[alphabet agencies]] [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]], [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.\n\nThe Democrats won easy landslide victories in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled and Catholics, Jews, and Blacks were especially impacted. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' [[political machine]]s were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937\u201338 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him.<ref>Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).</ref>  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898\u20131945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.<ref>Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt's efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and halted the expansion of New Deal ideas. Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities. In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored Willkie 52%\u201348%.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940.\" ''Ethnicity.

The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and after the collapse of the stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world in depression, 1929\u20131939|last=Kindleberger|first=Charles P.|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.\n\n=== Hoover Administration gold standard ===\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1930s, The United States began to try the tight money policy to promote economic growth. In terms of the fiscal policy, the US government failed to reach a consensus on the fiscal issue. President Hoover began to expand federal spending, he set up a governmental financial revitalization company to provide emergency assistance to banks and financial institutions that were on the verge of bankruptcy. Hoover's fiscal policy had accelerated the recession. In December 1929, as means of showing government confidence of the economy, Hoover reduced all income tax rates by 1% of 1929 due to the continuing budget surplus. By 1930, the surplus turned into a fast-growing deficit of economic contraction. In 1931, the US federal fiscal revenue and expenditure changed from the financial surplus to deficit for the first time (the deficit was less than 2.8% of GDP). By the end of 1931, Hoover had decided to recommend a large increase in taxes to balance the budget; in addition, Congress approved the tax increase in 1932, a substantial reduction in personal immunity to increase the number of taxpayers, and the interest rates had risen sharply, the lowest marginal rate rose from 25% on taxable income in excess of $100,000 to 63% on taxable income in excess of $1 million as the rates were made much more progressive. Hoover changed his approach to fighting the Depression. He justified his call for more federal assistance by noting that \"We used such emergency powers to win the war; we can use them to fight the Depression, the misery, and suffering from which are equally great.\" This new approach embraced a number of initiatives. Unfortunately for the President, none proved especially effective. Just as important, with the presidential election approaching, the political heat generated by the Great Depression and the failure of Hoover's policies grew only more withering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://millercenter.org/president/hoover/domestic-affairs|title=Herbert Hoover: Domestic Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|website=millercenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the financial reform, since the recession, Hoover had been trying to repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing \"more effective supporting for each national committee\" and volunteer service -\" appealing for funding\" from outside the government.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/new-deal/resources/herbert-hoover-great-depression-and-new-deal-1931%E2%80%931933|title=Herbert Hoover on the Great Depression and New Deal, 1931\u20131933 {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2013-07-24|website=gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\" /> Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism. In his re-election campaign, Hoover tried to persuade the Americans to claim that the measures they requested seemed to be helpful in the short term, but it would be devastating in the long run. Eventually, he was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.\n\n==== Consequences of the Hoover policy ====\nIn 1929, the Great Depression began, the asset bubble burst, and the unemployment rate rose. The following year, though most people thought that there was nothing worth worrying about, Hoover took decisive action on issues such as employment, construction, public construction, and agriculture, which helped restore public confidence. The unemployed population rose, although it remained less than 9%.\n\nIn 1931, \"the tragic year\", politicians and economists were convinced that the economy would recover in 1931, but a serious economic crisis and depression happened this year. In a somewhat critical atmosphere, at the Congress meeting in 1932, Hoover prepared to take more vigorous measures in the government work report which he submitted to the Congress. Primarily, Hoover affirmed his own achievements over the past two years. Owing to Hoover's policy having led to financial spending increases and financial difficulties, he decided to increase taxes.\n\n=== Roosevelt Administration gold standard ===\nAt the beginning of 1933, during the last few weeks of Hoover's term, the American financial system was paralyzed. The Great Depression had been extended by the interventionist policy for four years. Bank crisis caused the serious deflationary pressures. In fact, the worst period of 1932 \u2013 the Great Depression had passed, but the recovery was slow and weak. Roosevelt understood that traditional political and financial policy was not an adequate response to the crisis, and his administration chose to pursue the more radical measures of the [[New Deal]].\n<p>During the financial crisis of 1933 culminating in the banking holiday of March 1933, gold had flowed out from the Fed in large quantities, to individuals and companies in the United States worried about bank failures, and to foreign entities worried about the depreciation of the dollar.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts_gold_program|title=Roosevelt's Gold Program {{!}} Federal Reserve History|last=Richardson|first=Gary|website=federalreservehistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> \n<p>In the spring and summer of 1933, the Roosevelt administration and the Congress took several actions that effectively suspended the gold standard. \nRoosevelt took office on March 4, 1933, and thirty-six hours later, he declared a nationwide bank moratorium in order to prevent a run on the banks by consumers lacking confidence in the economy. He also forbade banks to pay out gold or to export it. \n<p>On March 9, Congress passed the [[Emergency Banking Act]], giving the President the power to control international and domestic gold exports. It also gave the treasury secretary the power to surrender of gold coins and certificates. \n<p>On April 5, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold certificates in denominations of more than $100 turned in for other money. It required all persons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve by May 1 for the set price of $20.67 per ounce. By May 10, the government had taken in $300 million of gold coin and $470 million of gold certificates.\n<p>On April 20, President Roosevelt issued a formal proclamation prohibiting gold exports, and prohibiting conversion of money and deposits into gold coins and ingots.\n<p>On May 12, the United States weakened the monetary connection with gold further when FDR signed the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]]. Title III of this act, also known as the Thomas amendment, gave the President power to reduce the dollar's gold content by as much as 50%. President Roosevelt also used the silver standard instead of gold to exchange dollars, it determined by the price of the bank.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\" /> \n<p>On June 5, Congress enacted a joint resolution nullifying the clauses in many public and private obligations that permitted creditors to demand repayment in gold.\n<p>In 1934, the government price of gold was increased to $35 per ounce, effectively increasing the gold on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheets by 69 percent. This increase in assets allowed the Federal Reserve to further inflate the money supply.\nThe abandonment of the gold standard made the Wall Street stock prices quickly increase; Wall Street's stock trading was exceptionally active.\n\n==Political responses of the depression era==\n\n=== Hoover's response ===\n[[File:President Hoover portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Herbert Hoover]]\nThe [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover Administration]] attempted to correct the economic situation quickly, but was unsuccessful. Throughout Hoover's presidency, businesses were encouraged to keep wage rates high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/746.html|title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> President Hoover and many academics believed that high wage rates would maintain a steady level of purchasing power, keeping the economy turning. In December 1929, after the beginning phases of the depression had begun, President Hoover continued to promote high wages. It wasn't until 1931 that business owners began reducing wages in order to stay afloat. Later that year, The Hoover Administration created the Check Tax<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ari.aynrand.org/blog/2017/02/01/the-great-depression-and-the-role-of-government-intervention|title=The Great Depression and the Role of Government Intervention|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> to generate extra government funding. The tax added a two cent tax to the purchase of all bank checks, directly affecting the common person. This additional cost pushed people away from using checks, so instead the majority of the population increased their usage of cash. Banks had already closed due to cash shortage, but this reaction to the Check Tax rapidly increased the pace.\n\n===Roosevelt's New Deal===\nIn the \"First New Deal\" of 1933\u201334, a wide variety of programs were targeted toward the depression and agriculture in rural areas, in the banking industry, and for the economy as a whole. Relief programs were set up for the long-term unemployed who are routinely passed over whenever new jobs did open up.<ref>Eric Rauchway. ''The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction'' (2008).</ref><ref>Aaron D. Purcell, ed. ''Interpreting American History: The New Deal and the Great Depression'' (2014).</ref> The most popular program was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] that put young men to work in construction jobs, especially in rural areas. Prohibition was repealed, fulfilling a campaign pledge and generating new tax revenues for local and state government. A series of relief programs were designed to provide jobs, in cooperation with local governments.\n\nThe [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief through increased government spending. To end [[deflation]] the [[gold standard]] was suspended and a series of panels comprising business leaders in each industry set regulations which ended what was called \"cut-throat competition,\" believed to be responsible for forcing down prices and profits nationwide.<ref>Olivier Blanchard und Gerhard Illing, ''Makro\u00f6konomie'', Pearson Studium, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8273-7363-2}}, pp. 696\u201397</ref>  Several Hoover agencies were continued, most notably the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which provided large-scale financial aid to banks, railroads, and other agencies.<ref>James Stuart Olson, ''Saving Capitalism: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the New Deal, 1933\u20131940'' (2nd ed. 2017).</ref> Reforms that had never been enacted in the 1920s now took center stage, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) designed to electrify and modernize a very poor, mountainous region in Appalachia.\n\n[[File:NewDeal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Top left: the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], part of the [[New Deal]], being signed into law in 1933.<br />Top right: [[Franklin D.

Unemployment fell by \u2154 in Roosevelt's first term (from 25% to 9%, 1933\u20131937). The second set of reforms launched by the Roosevelt Administration during the same period included the [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]]. Insurance and poor relief (\"public assistance\" or \"welfare\") are constituent parts of the legislation, which provided pensions to the aged, benefit payments to dependent mothers, crippled children and blind people, and unemployment insurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1851.html|title=The New Deal|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The Social Security Act still plays a significant role of the American health and human service system so far.

In 1937, the American economy unexpectedly fell, lasting through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938.<ref>Kenneth D. Roose, ''The Economics of Recession and Revival: An Interpretation of 1937\u201338'', (1969)</ref> A contributing factor to the Recession of 1937 was a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.

Ignoring the pleas of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938 in an effort to increase mass purchasing power.\n\n[[File:US Employment Graph - 1920 to 1940.svg|thumb|Total employment numbers in the United States from 1920 to 1940, excluding farms and [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]]]\n\nBusiness-oriented observers explained the recession and recovery in very different terms from the Keynesian economists. They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935\u201337. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had a negative impact on major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on big corporations. But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.<ref>Gary Dean Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933\u20131938'' (1990) pp 175\u2013216</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, according to economist [[Robert Higgs]], when looking only at the supply of consumer goods, significant GDP growth only resumed in 1946. (Higgs does not estimate the value to consumers of collective goods like victory in war.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Higgs |first=Robert |date=March 1992 |title=Wartime Prosperity?

The incorrect prediction by [[Alvin Hansen]] and other Keynesians that a new depression would start after the war failed to take account of pent-up consumer demand as a result of the Depression and World War.<ref>Theodore Rosenof, ''Economics in the Long Run: New Deal Theorists and Their Legacies, 1932\u20131993'' (1997)</ref>\n\n==Afterward==\n[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|left|A woman working in a military aircraft factory in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] in 1942.

''The Library of Congress''.</ref> By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, but that was not enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through [[cost-plus contract]]s. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus a certain percentage profit margin. That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940\u20131945'' (2004)</ref>\n\nUsing these cost-plus contracts in 1941\u20131943, factories hired hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers and trained them, at government expense. The military's own training programs concentrated on teaching technical skills involving machinery, engines, electronics and radio, preparing soldiers and sailors for the post-war economy.<ref>Jensen (1989); Edwin E. Witte, \"What The War Is Doing to Us\". ''Review of Politics''. (Jan. 1943).

(See [[Fair Employment Practices Commission|FEPC]]) Strikes (except in [[coal mining]]) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members to work harder. Tens of thousands of new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.<ref>Harold G. Vester. ''The U.S. Economy in World War III''. (1988)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's declining popularity in 1938 was evident throughout the US in the business community, the press, and the Senate and House. Many were labeling the recession the \"Roosevelt Recession\". In late December 1938, Roosevelt looked to gain popularity with the American people, and try to regain the nation's confidence in the economy. His decision that December to name [[Harry Hopkins]] as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] was an attempt to achieve the confidence he so badly needed. The appointment came as a surprise to most because of Hopkins' lack of business experience, but proved to be vastly important in shaping the years following the recession.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\">Smiley, Gene. ''Rethinking the Great Depression''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, publisher. 2002.</ref>\n\nHopkins made it his mission to strengthen ties between the Roosevelt administration and the business community. While Roosevelt believed in complete reform (The New Deal), Hopkins took a more administrative position;{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} he felt that recovery was imperative and that The New Deal would continue to hinder recovery. With support from [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] and [[United States Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr]], popular support for recovery, rather than reform, swept the nation. By the end of 1938 reform had been struck down, as no new reform laws were passed.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\"/>\n\nThe economy in America was now beginning to show signs of recovery and the unemployment rate was lowering following the abysmal year of 1938. The biggest shift towards recovery, however, came with the decision of Germany to invade France at the beginning of WWII. After France had been defeated, the U.S. economy would skyrocket in the months following. France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\">Hall, Thomas E., and Ferguson, David J. \"The Great Depression: An International Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies\". Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. 1998. pg 155</ref>\n\nThe need for these war materials created a huge spurt in production, thus leading to promising amount of employment in America. Moreover, Britain chose to pay for their materials in gold. This stimulated the gold inflow and raised the monetary base, which in turn, stimulated the American economy to its highest point since the summer of 1929 when the depression began.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1941, before American entry into the war, defense spending and military mobilization had started one of the greatest booms in American history thus ending the last traces of unemployment.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\"/>\n\n==Facts and figures==\n[[File:Franklin-roosevelt.JPG|thumb|250px|{{listen\n | filename     = Fireside Chat 1 On the Banking Crisis (March 12, 1933) Franklin Delano Roosevelt.ogg\n | title        = Fireside Chat 1 On the Banking Crisis\n | description  = Roosevelt's first [[Fireside Chat]] on the Banking Crisis (March 12, 1933)\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | plain = yes\n | embed = yes\n}}]]\n\nEffects of depression in the U.S.:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7655472.stm|work=BBC News|title=I remember the Wall Street Crash|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate= May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n* 13 million people became unemployed.

Also hard hit was the manufacturing of durable goods like automobiles and appliances, whose purchase consumers could postpone. The economy hit bottom in the winter of 1932\u201333; then came four years of growth until the [[recession of 1937\u201338]] brought back high levels of unemployment.<ref>Chandler (1970); Jensen (1989); Mitchell (1964)</ref>\n\n[[File:Real GDP of the United States from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|US annual real GDP from 1910 to 1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u20131939) highlighted]]\n[[File:US Unemployment from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|300px|Unemployment rate in the US 1910\u201360, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u201339) highlighted; accurate data begins in 1939, represented by a blue line.]]\n\nThe Depression caused major political changes in America. Three years into the depression, President [[Herbert Hoover]], widely shamed for not doing enough to combat the crisis, lost the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]] to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by an embarrassingly wide margin. Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the [[New Deal]], instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nThe Depression also resulted in an increase of [[emigration]] for the first time in American history. Some immigrants went back to their native countries, and some native U.S. citizens went to [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. There were mass migrations of people from badly hit areas in the [[Great Plains]] (the [[Okies]]) and the South to places such as California and the cities of the North (the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]).<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/afctshtml/tsme.html The Migrant Experience].

A well-known example of an emigrant was [[Frank McCourt]], who went to [[Ireland]], as recounted in his book ''[[Angela's Ashes]]''.\n\nThe memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns, such as the use of [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus packages]], [[Keynesian economics]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. It also shaped modern American literature, resulting in famous novels such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.\n\nExamining the [[causes of the Great Depression]] raises multiple issues: what factors set off the first downturn in 1929; what structural weaknesses and specific events turned it into a major depression; how the downturn spread from country to country; and why the economic recovery was so prolonged.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Defining Moment: The Great Depression and the American Economy in the Twentieth Century |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-226-06589-2 |editor-last=Bordo |editor-first=Michael D. |editor-link=Michael D.

There was no [[FDIC|federal deposit insurance]] during that time as [[Bank failure|bank failures]] were considered a normal part of economic life. Worried depositors started to withdraw savings, so the [[money multiplier]] worked in reverse. Banks were forced to liquidate assets (such as calling in loans rather than creating new loans).<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\">Robert Fuller (2012), ''Phantom of Fear: The Banking Panic of 1933'', pp. 241\u201342 fn. 45</ref> This caused the [[money supply]] to shrink and the economy to contract (the [[Great Contraction]]), resulting in a significant decline in aggregate investment.

In theory, the U.S. would have two potential responses to that: Allow the [[exchange rate]] to adjust, or increase their own interest rates to maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into [[Franc|francs]] to buy more French assets, the demand for the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] fell, and the exchange rate increased.

It began on October 24, 1929, and was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States. Much of the stock market crash can be attributed to exuberance and false expectations. In the years leading up to 1929, the rising stock market prices had created vast sums of wealth in relation to amounts invested, in turn encouraging borrowing to further buy more stock. However, on October 24 (Black Thursday), share prices began to fall and panic selling caused prices to fall sharply. On October 29 (Black Tuesday), share prices fell by $14 billion in a single day, more than $30 billion in the week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/economic-forces/the-economic-causes-and-impacts-of-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929-fall-2012|title=The Economic Causes and Impacts of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (Fall 2012) - Historpedia|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> The value that evaporated that week was ten times more than the entire federal budget and more than all of what the U.S. had spent on [[World War I]].

After the stock market crash and the bank closures, people were afraid of losing more money. Because of their fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted the American economy.\n\n==Banking failures==\n\nA large contribution to the [[recession]] was the closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. Financial institutions failed for several reasons, including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the [[Gold standard]], [[consumer confidence]] in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compounding issues the banking system struggled to keep up with the public's increasing demand for cash withdrawals. This overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to [[short sale (real estate)]] and [[liquidation]] of existing loans.<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\" /> In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis began with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931. By October 1931 over 2100 banks were suspended with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District, with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended.<ref>\"Banking Panics (1930\u20131933).\" Encyclopedia of the Great Depression. Encyclopedia.com. 13 Jun. 2017<http://www.encyclopedia.com>.</ref> The economy as a whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933. \n[[File:Banking_Closure_in_1929_-_New_York_City.jpg|thumb|People outside a closed bank after 1929 stock market crash.]]\n\nThe closures resulted in a massive withdrawal of deposits by millions of Americans estimated at near $6.8 billion (equivalent to around $60 billion in today's dollars). During this time the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) was not in place resulting in a loss of roughly $1.36 billion (or 20%) of the total $6.8 billion accounted for within the failed banks. These losses came directly from everyday individuals' savings, investments and bank accounts. As a result, [[GDP]] fell from the high seven-hundreds in 1929 to the low to mid six-hundreds in 1933 before seeing any recovery for the first time in nearly 4 years.<ref>USA annual GDP from 1910-60, in billions of constant 2005 dollars, with the years of the [[Great Depression]] (1929\u20131939) highlighted. Based on data from: Louis D. Johnston and Samuel H. Williamson, \"What Was the U.S. GDP Then?\" MeasuringWorth, 2008</ref> Federal leadership intervention is highly debated on its effectiveness and overall participation. The [[Federal Reserve Act]] could not effectively tackle the banking crisis as state bank and trust companies were not compelled to be a member, paper eligible discount member banks heavily restricted access to the Federal Reserve, power between the twelve Federal Reserve banks was decentralized and federal level leadership was ineffective, inexperienced, and weak.\n\n===Unregulated growth===\n\nThroughout the early 1900s banking regulations were extremely lax if not non-existent. The Currency Act of 1900 lowered the required [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of investors from 50,000 to 25,000 to create a [[national bank]]. As a result of this change nearly two thirds of the banks formed over the next ten years were quite small, averaging just above the 25,000 in required capital.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-41. Web. 2005</ref> The number of banks would nearly double (number of banks divided by Real GDP) from 1890 to 1920 due to the lack of oversight and qualification when banking [[charter]]s were being issued in the first two decades of the 1900s.<ref>(Federal Reserve Board 1933, 63\u201365).</ref>\n\nThe unregulated growth of small rural banking institutions can be partially attributed to the rising cost of [[agriculture]] especially in the [[Corn Belt]] and [[Cotton Belt]]. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply the needed capital to meet the farm [[commodity market]], however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising from 1887 to 1920 with an average of 6 percent growth in [GDP]. In particular the participation in [[World War I]] drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level which, in turn, resulted in a more lax approach in the lending process. Over banked conditions existed which pressured struggling banks to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market.<ref>Federal Reserve Board 1933, 67.</ref> Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result. \n[[File:Dust storm approaching Stratford, Texas 1935.jpg|thumb|Approaching dust storm near Stratford, Texas. April 18, 1935.]]\nCrop failures beginning in 1921 began to impact this poorly regulated system, the expansion areas of corn and cotton suffered the largest due to the [[dust bowl]] era resulting in real estate value reductions. In addition, the year 1921 was the peak for banking expansion with roughly 31,000 banks in activity, however, with the failures at the agricultural level 505 banks would close between 1921 -1930 marking the largest banking system failure on record.  Regulatory questions began to hit the debating table around banking qualifications as a result; discussions would continue into the [Great Depression] as not only were banks failing but some would disappear altogether with no rhyme or reason.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-53. Web. 21 May 2017.</ref> The panic of financial crisis would increase in the Great Depression due to the lack of confidence in the regulatory and recovery displayed during the 1920s, this ultimately drove a nation of doubts, uneasiness, and lack of consumer confidence in the banking system.\n\n===Contagion===\n\nWith a lack of consumer confidence in the economic direction given by the federal government panic started to spread across the country shortly after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. President Hoover retained the [[Gold Standard]] as the country's currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. [[Europe]]'s decision to move away from the [[Gold Standard]] caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to hoard gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months.  Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic began to set in. Contagion spread like wild fire pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits ''en masse''. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced banking failure took a mild recession to a major recession.<ref>Richardson, Gary. \"Banking Panics of 1930\u201331\". Federal Reserve History. N.p., 22 Nov. 2013. Web. 13 June 2017</ref>\n\nWhether this caused the Great Depression is still heavily debated due to many other attributing factors. However, it is evident that the banking system suffered massive reductions across the country due to the lack of consumer confidence. As withdraw requests would exceed cash availability banks began conducting steed discount sales such as fire sales and short sales. Due to the inability to immediately determine current value worth these fire sales and short sales would result in massive losses when recuperating any possible revenue for outstanding and defaulted loans. This would allow healthy banks to take advantage of the struggling units forcing additional losses resulting in banks not being able to deliver on depositor demands and creating a failing cycle that would become widespread.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 45\u201346. Web. 2005</ref> Investment would continue to stay low through the next half decade as the private sector would hoard savings due to uncertainty of the future. The federal government would run additional policy changes such as the Check tax, monetary restrictions (including reduction of money supply by burning), High Wage Policy, and the New Deal through the Hoover and Roosevelt administration.\n\n==Urban desperation politic==\n[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935]]\nOne visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s,  which were ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in the shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the [[Democratic National Committee]], to refer sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies Michelson blamed for the depression.<ref>Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88</ref>\n\nThe government did not calculate unemployment rates in the 1930s. The most widely accepted estimates of unemployment rates for the Great Depression are those by Stanley Lebergott from the 1950s. He estimated that unemployment reached 24.9 percent in the worst days of 1933. Another commonly cited estimate is by Michael Darby in 1976. He put the unemployment rate at a peak of 22.5 percent in 1932.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smiley |first1=Gene |title=Recent Unemployment Rate Estimates for the 1920s and 1930s |url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/2120839.pdf |website=wisc.edu |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Job losses were less severe among women, workers in non durable industries (such as food and clothing), services and sales workers, and those employed by the government. Unskilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates. Age also played a factor. Young people had a hard time getting their first job. Men over the age of 45, if they lost their job, would rarely find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were not, and they fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration in the 1920s that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities suddenly reversed itself. Unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.<ref>Richard J. Jensen, \"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553\u2013583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954 in JSTOR]; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]</ref>  City governments in 1930\u201331 tried to meet the depression by expanding [[Public works|public works projects]], as President Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However, tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931; no one was able to provide significant additional relief. People fell back on the cheapest possible relief, including soup kitchens providing free meals to anyone who showed up.<ref>Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)</ref> After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.\n\nThe federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by President Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis. The [[alphabet agencies]] [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]], [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.\n\nThe Democrats won easy landslide victories in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled and Catholics, Jews, and Blacks were especially impacted. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' [[political machine]]s were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937\u201338 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him.<ref>Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).</ref>  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898\u20131945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.<ref>Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt's efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and halted the expansion of New Deal ideas. Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities. In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored Willkie 52%\u201348%.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940.\" ''Ethnicity.

Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.<ref>[[Jon C.

The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and after the collapse of the stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world in depression, 1929\u20131939|last=Kindleberger|first=Charles P.|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.\n\n=== Hoover Administration gold standard ===\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1930s, The United States began to try the tight money policy to promote economic growth. In terms of the fiscal policy, the US government failed to reach a consensus on the fiscal issue. President Hoover began to expand federal spending, he set up a governmental financial revitalization company to provide emergency assistance to banks and financial institutions that were on the verge of bankruptcy. Hoover's fiscal policy had accelerated the recession. In December 1929, as means of showing government confidence of the economy, Hoover reduced all income tax rates by 1% of 1929 due to the continuing budget surplus. By 1930, the surplus turned into a fast-growing deficit of economic contraction. In 1931, the US federal fiscal revenue and expenditure changed from the financial surplus to deficit for the first time (the deficit was less than 2.8% of GDP). By the end of 1931, Hoover had decided to recommend a large increase in taxes to balance the budget; in addition, Congress approved the tax increase in 1932, a substantial reduction in personal immunity to increase the number of taxpayers, and the interest rates had risen sharply, the lowest marginal rate rose from 25% on taxable income in excess of $100,000 to 63% on taxable income in excess of $1 million as the rates were made much more progressive. Hoover changed his approach to fighting the Depression. He justified his call for more federal assistance by noting that \"We used such emergency powers to win the war; we can use them to fight the Depression, the misery, and suffering from which are equally great.\" This new approach embraced a number of initiatives. Unfortunately for the President, none proved especially effective. Just as important, with the presidential election approaching, the political heat generated by the Great Depression and the failure of Hoover's policies grew only more withering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://millercenter.org/president/hoover/domestic-affairs|title=Herbert Hoover: Domestic Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|website=millercenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the financial reform, since the recession, Hoover had been trying to repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing \"more effective supporting for each national committee\" and volunteer service -\" appealing for funding\" from outside the government.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/new-deal/resources/herbert-hoover-great-depression-and-new-deal-1931%E2%80%931933|title=Herbert Hoover on the Great Depression and New Deal, 1931\u20131933 {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2013-07-24|website=gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\" /> Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism. In his re-election campaign, Hoover tried to persuade the Americans to claim that the measures they requested seemed to be helpful in the short term, but it would be devastating in the long run. Eventually, he was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.\n\n==== Consequences of the Hoover policy ====\nIn 1929, the Great Depression began, the asset bubble burst, and the unemployment rate rose. The following year, though most people thought that there was nothing worth worrying about, Hoover took decisive action on issues such as employment, construction, public construction, and agriculture, which helped restore public confidence. The unemployed population rose, although it remained less than 9%.\n\nIn 1931, \"the tragic year\", politicians and economists were convinced that the economy would recover in 1931, but a serious economic crisis and depression happened this year. In a somewhat critical atmosphere, at the Congress meeting in 1932, Hoover prepared to take more vigorous measures in the government work report which he submitted to the Congress. Primarily, Hoover affirmed his own achievements over the past two years. Owing to Hoover's policy having led to financial spending increases and financial difficulties, he decided to increase taxes.\n\n=== Roosevelt Administration gold standard ===\nAt the beginning of 1933, during the last few weeks of Hoover's term, the American financial system was paralyzed. The Great Depression had been extended by the interventionist policy for four years. Bank crisis caused the serious deflationary pressures. In fact, the worst period of 1932 \u2013 the Great Depression had passed, but the recovery was slow and weak. Roosevelt understood that traditional political and financial policy was not an adequate response to the crisis, and his administration chose to pursue the more radical measures of the [[New Deal]].\n<p>During the financial crisis of 1933 culminating in the banking holiday of March 1933, gold had flowed out from the Fed in large quantities, to individuals and companies in the United States worried about bank failures, and to foreign entities worried about the depreciation of the dollar.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts_gold_program|title=Roosevelt's Gold Program {{!}} Federal Reserve History|last=Richardson|first=Gary|website=federalreservehistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> \n<p>In the spring and summer of 1933, the Roosevelt administration and the Congress took several actions that effectively suspended the gold standard. \nRoosevelt took office on March 4, 1933, and thirty-six hours later, he declared a nationwide bank moratorium in order to prevent a run on the banks by consumers lacking confidence in the economy. He also forbade banks to pay out gold or to export it. \n<p>On March 9, Congress passed the [[Emergency Banking Act]], giving the President the power to control international and domestic gold exports. It also gave the treasury secretary the power to surrender of gold coins and certificates. \n<p>On April 5, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold certificates in denominations of more than $100 turned in for other money. It required all persons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve by May 1 for the set price of $20.67 per ounce. By May 10, the government had taken in $300 million of gold coin and $470 million of gold certificates.\n<p>On April 20, President Roosevelt issued a formal proclamation prohibiting gold exports, and prohibiting conversion of money and deposits into gold coins and ingots.\n<p>On May 12, the United States weakened the monetary connection with gold further when FDR signed the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]]. Title III of this act, also known as the Thomas amendment, gave the President power to reduce the dollar's gold content by as much as 50%. President Roosevelt also used the silver standard instead of gold to exchange dollars, it determined by the price of the bank.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\" /> \n<p>On June 5, Congress enacted a joint resolution nullifying the clauses in many public and private obligations that permitted creditors to demand repayment in gold.\n<p>In 1934, the government price of gold was increased to $35 per ounce, effectively increasing the gold on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheets by 69 percent. This increase in assets allowed the Federal Reserve to further inflate the money supply.\nThe abandonment of the gold standard made the Wall Street stock prices quickly increase; Wall Street's stock trading was exceptionally active.\n\n==Political responses of the depression era==\n\n=== Hoover's response ===\n[[File:President Hoover portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Herbert Hoover]]\nThe [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover Administration]] attempted to correct the economic situation quickly, but was unsuccessful. Throughout Hoover's presidency, businesses were encouraged to keep wage rates high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/746.html|title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> President Hoover and many academics believed that high wage rates would maintain a steady level of purchasing power, keeping the economy turning. In December 1929, after the beginning phases of the depression had begun, President Hoover continued to promote high wages. It wasn't until 1931 that business owners began reducing wages in order to stay afloat. Later that year, The Hoover Administration created the Check Tax<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ari.aynrand.org/blog/2017/02/01/the-great-depression-and-the-role-of-government-intervention|title=The Great Depression and the Role of Government Intervention|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> to generate extra government funding. The tax added a two cent tax to the purchase of all bank checks, directly affecting the common person. This additional cost pushed people away from using checks, so instead the majority of the population increased their usage of cash. Banks had already closed due to cash shortage, but this reaction to the Check Tax rapidly increased the pace.\n\n===Roosevelt's New Deal===\nIn the \"First New Deal\" of 1933\u201334, a wide variety of programs were targeted toward the depression and agriculture in rural areas, in the banking industry, and for the economy as a whole. Relief programs were set up for the long-term unemployed who are routinely passed over whenever new jobs did open up.<ref>Eric Rauchway. ''The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction'' (2008).</ref><ref>Aaron D. Purcell, ed. ''Interpreting American History: The New Deal and the Great Depression'' (2014).</ref> The most popular program was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] that put young men to work in construction jobs, especially in rural areas. Prohibition was repealed, fulfilling a campaign pledge and generating new tax revenues for local and state government. A series of relief programs were designed to provide jobs, in cooperation with local governments.\n\nThe [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief through increased government spending. To end [[deflation]] the [[gold standard]] was suspended and a series of panels comprising business leaders in each industry set regulations which ended what was called \"cut-throat competition,\" believed to be responsible for forcing down prices and profits nationwide.<ref>Olivier Blanchard und Gerhard Illing, ''Makro\u00f6konomie'', Pearson Studium, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8273-7363-2}}, pp. 696\u201397</ref>  Several Hoover agencies were continued, most notably the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which provided large-scale financial aid to banks, railroads, and other agencies.<ref>James Stuart Olson, ''Saving Capitalism: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the New Deal, 1933\u20131940'' (2nd ed. 2017).</ref> Reforms that had never been enacted in the 1920s now took center stage, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) designed to electrify and modernize a very poor, mountainous region in Appalachia.\n\n[[File:NewDeal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Top left: the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], part of the [[New Deal]], being signed into law in 1933.<br />Top right: [[Franklin D.

Unemployment fell by \u2154 in Roosevelt's first term (from 25% to 9%, 1933\u20131937). The second set of reforms launched by the Roosevelt Administration during the same period included the [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]]. Insurance and poor relief (\"public assistance\" or \"welfare\") are constituent parts of the legislation, which provided pensions to the aged, benefit payments to dependent mothers, crippled children and blind people, and unemployment insurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1851.html|title=The New Deal|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The Social Security Act still plays a significant role of the American health and human service system so far.

In 1937, the American economy unexpectedly fell, lasting through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938.<ref>Kenneth D.

Ignoring the pleas of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938 in an effort to increase mass purchasing power.\n\n[[File:US Employment Graph - 1920 to 1940.svg|thumb|Total employment numbers in the United States from 1920 to 1940, excluding farms and [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]]]\n\nBusiness-oriented observers explained the recession and recovery in very different terms from the Keynesian economists. They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935\u201337. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had a negative impact on major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on big corporations. But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.<ref>Gary Dean Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933\u20131938'' (1990) pp 175\u2013216</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, according to economist [[Robert Higgs]], when looking only at the supply of consumer goods, significant GDP growth only resumed in 1946.

''The Library of Congress''.</ref> By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, but that was not enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through [[cost-plus contract]]s. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus a certain percentage profit margin. That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940\u20131945'' (2004)</ref>\n\nUsing these cost-plus contracts in 1941\u20131943, factories hired hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers and trained them, at government expense. The military's own training programs concentrated on teaching technical skills involving machinery, engines, electronics and radio, preparing soldiers and sailors for the post-war economy.<ref>Jensen (1989); Edwin E.

(See [[Fair Employment Practices Commission|FEPC]]) Strikes (except in [[coal mining]]) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members to work harder. Tens of thousands of new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.<ref>Harold G. Vester. ''The U.S. Economy in World War III''. (1988)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's declining popularity in 1938 was evident throughout the US in the business community, the press, and the Senate and House. Many were labeling the recession the \"Roosevelt Recession\". In late December 1938, Roosevelt looked to gain popularity with the American people, and try to regain the nation's confidence in the economy. His decision that December to name [[Harry Hopkins]] as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] was an attempt to achieve the confidence he so badly needed. The appointment came as a surprise to most because of Hopkins' lack of business experience, but proved to be vastly important in shaping the years following the recession.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\">Smiley, Gene. ''Rethinking the Great Depression''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, publisher. 2002.</ref>\n\nHopkins made it his mission to strengthen ties between the Roosevelt administration and the business community. While Roosevelt believed in complete reform (The New Deal), Hopkins took a more administrative position;{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} he felt that recovery was imperative and that The New Deal would continue to hinder recovery. With support from [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] and [[United States Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr]], popular support for recovery, rather than reform, swept the nation. By the end of 1938 reform had been struck down, as no new reform laws were passed.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\"/>\n\nThe economy in America was now beginning to show signs of recovery and the unemployment rate was lowering following the abysmal year of 1938. The biggest shift towards recovery, however, came with the decision of Germany to invade France at the beginning of WWII. After France had been defeated, the U.S. economy would skyrocket in the months following. France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\">Hall, Thomas E., and Ferguson, David J. \"The Great Depression: An International Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies\". Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. 1998. pg 155</ref>\n\nThe need for these war materials created a huge spurt in production, thus leading to promising amount of employment in America. Moreover, Britain chose to pay for their materials in gold. This stimulated the gold inflow and raised the monetary base, which in turn, stimulated the American economy to its highest point since the summer of 1929 when the depression began.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1941, before American entry into the war, defense spending and military mobilization had started one of the greatest booms in American history thus ending the last traces of unemployment.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\"/>\n\n==Facts and figures==\n[[File:Franklin-roosevelt.JPG|thumb|250px|{{listen\n | filename     = Fireside Chat 1 On the Banking Crisis (March 12, 1933) Franklin Delano Roosevelt.ogg\n | title        = Fireside Chat 1 On the Banking Crisis\n | description  = Roosevelt's first [[Fireside Chat]] on the Banking Crisis (March 12, 1933)\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | plain = yes\n | embed = yes\n}}]]\n\nEffects of depression in the U.S.:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7655472.stm|work=BBC News|title=I remember the Wall Street Crash|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate= May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n* 13 million people became unemployed.

She chained herself to a walnut tree at the [[South Central Farm]] for three weeks to protest against the farmers' eviction by the property's new owner, Ralph Horowitz.

A [[construction permit]] for 107.3 was issued by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 1990 with the working [[call sign]] WUMC.  But that version never made it to the airwaves.  \n\nEclipse Broadcasting bought the construction permit in 1993 for $55,000.  When it finally was heard, the station's call letters were WBZN and it aired a \"Greatest Hits of the 70s\" [[classic hits]] format.  Eclipse Broadcasting was started by Chuck Foster and [[Mike Elliott (radio personality)|Mike Elliott]]. During that period WBZN began calling itself ''Z107.3''. \n\nThe station was heavily involved with Eastern Maine Medical Center's Children's Miracle Network charities spearheaded by Sales Manager Greg Carpenter.\n\nIn 1998, [[Cumulus Media]], one of America's largest radio station owners, bought WBZN and [[sister station]] 106.5 [[WQCB]] for $6.4 million.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/2009/Radio-BC-YB-2009.pdf Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2009 page D-260]</ref>  Several years later, Cumulus decided to leave Maine and sold the radio stations to [[Townsquare Media]].\n\n==On-air staff==\nCurrent on-air staff includes: \n*The Z Morning Show with Kid and Sabrina\n*Paul Wolfe\n*Chuck Foster\n==Former Logo==\n[[File:WBZN Logo.png]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wbzn-fm.com Z107.3 website]\n*{{FM station data|WBZN}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Bangor Radio}}\n{{Contemporary Hit Radio Stations in Maine}}\n{{Townsquare Media}}\n\n{{coord|45.010|N|68.748|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Maine|BZN]]\n[[Category:Media in Penobscot County, Maine]]\n[[Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1996]]\n[[Category:Townsquare Media radio stations]]\n[[Category:1996 establishments in Maine]]\n\n\n{{Maine-radio-station-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Cerebellum", "label": "safe", "comment": "mistagged article - it has sources.you can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZN"}

of [[Hisar district]] of [[Hisar division]] in the state of [[Haryana]] in northwestern [[India]]. It is located 164&nbsp;km (102&nbsp;mi) to the west of [[New Delhi]], [[India]]'s capital, and has been identified as a [[National Capital Region (India)#Counter magnets|counter-magnet]] city for the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] to develop as an alternative center of growth to Delhi.\n\nThe city was ruled by several major powers, including the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] in the third century BC, the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]] in the 14th century, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th century, and the [[British Empire|British]] in the 19th century. After India achieved independence, it was unified with the state of Punjab. When the Punjab was divided in 1966, Hisar became part of Haryana.\n\nThe current name was given in 1354 AD, as ''Hisar-e-Firoza'' by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Firoz Shah Tughlaq]], the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultan of Delhi]] from 1351 to 1388. The Ghaggar and [[Drishadvati]] Rivers once flowed through the city, but they have now changed their course. Hisar has a [[continental climate]], with very hot summers and relatively cool winters.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nArcheological excavations at nearby locations of [[Rakhigarhi]], [[Siswal]], and [[Lohari Ragho]] suggest the presence of human habitation from [[pre-Harappan]] period.

of [[Hisar district]] of [[Hisar division]] in the state of [[Haryana]] in northwestern [[India]]. It is located 164&nbsp;km (102&nbsp;mi) to the west of [[New Delhi]], [[India]]'s capital, and has been identified as a [[National Capital Region (India)#Counter magnets|counter-magnet]] city for the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] to develop as an alternative center of growth to Delhi.\n\nThe city was ruled by several major powers, including the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] in the third century BC, the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]] in the 14th century, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th century, and the [[British Empire|British]] in the 19th century. After India achieved independence, it was unified with the state of Punjab. When the Punjab was divided in 1966, Hisar became part of Haryana.\n\nThe current name was given in 1354 AD, as ''Hisar-e-Firoza'' by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Firoz Shah Tughlaq]], the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultan of Delhi]] from 1351 to 1388. The Ghaggar and [[Drishadvati]] Rivers once flowed through the city, but they have now changed their course. Hisar has a [[continental climate]], with very hot summers and relatively cool winters.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nArcheological excavations at nearby locations of [[Rakhigarhi]], [[Siswal]], and [[Lohari Ragho]] suggest the presence of human habitation from [[pre-Harappan]] period.

With the label's blessing, Cash was allowed to release it on his own on the Cachet label and as a radio special with added narration.  \n\nHis efforts paid off, as the album made it into the Country Top 50, peaking at #43.  \n\nIn 1982, Columbia reissued the album itself, and in 1984 an edited-down version titled ''I Believe'' appeared on Arrival Records (see below).\n\nPrior to 2012 the only CD release of tracks from the album occurred with two tracks appearing in the ''God'' portion of the 2004 box set ''[[Love, God, Murder]]'' (a set compiled by Cash soon before his death in 2003), and two more tracks appeared on 2007's ''Ultimate Gospel''.

With the label's blessing, Cash was allowed to release it on his own on the Cachet label and as a radio special with added narration.  \n\nHis efforts paid off, as the album made it into the Country Top 50, peaking at #43.  \n\nIn 1982, Columbia reissued the album itself, and in 1984 an edited-down version titled ''I Believe'' appeared on Arrival Records (see below).\n\nPrior to 2012 the only CD release of tracks from the album occurred with two tracks appearing in the ''God'' portion of the 2004 box set ''[[Love, God, Murder]]'' (a set compiled by Cash soon before his death in 2003), and two more tracks appeared on 2007's ''Ultimate Gospel''.

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age. Gotti quickly became one of the crime family's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family [[underboss]] [[Aniello Dellacroce]], operating out of the [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park neighborhood]] of [[Queens]].\n\nEarly in his criminal career and following the [[FBI|FBI's]] indictment of members of Gotti's crew for selling narcotics, Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] for selling drugs. As this fear continued to grow, and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family, Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter, leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America's most powerful crime syndicate, and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from [[racketeering]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]], [[loan sharking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[bookmaking]], [[prostitution]], [[extortion]], [[pornography]], [[illegal gambling]] and other criminal activities.\n\nAt his peak, Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States. During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style, which gained him favor with some of the general public. While his peers avoided attracting attention, especially from the media, Gotti became known as \"The Dapper Don\", for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras. He was later given the nickname \"The [[Teflon]] Don\" after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his [[acquittal]], though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by [[jury tampering]], [[juror misconduct]], and [[witness intimidation]]. Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], Gotti earned between $5\u201320 million per year during his tenure as [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] boss.<ref name=maas452/>\n\nGotti's underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]] aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti. In 1991, Gravano agreed to [[turn state's evidence]] and testify for the prosecution against Gotti after hearing the boss making several disparaging remarks about Gravano on a [[wiretap]] that implicated them both in several murders. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of five murders, [[conspiracy to commit murder]], [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], [[obstruction of justice]], [[tax evasion]], illegal gambling, extortion, and loansharking. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without [[parole]] and was transferred to [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]] in southern Illinois. According to former [[Lucchese crime family]] boss [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]], \"What John Gotti did was the beginning of the end of ''[[American Mafia|Cosa Nostra]]''\".<ref>[[Philip Carlo]], ''Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss'', 2008.

Gotti was arrested a third time for hijacking while out on [[bail]] two months later, this time for stealing a load of cigarettes worth $50,000 on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Later that year, Gotti pleaded guilty to the [[Northwest Airlines]] hijacking and was sentenced to three years at [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]].<ref name=\"Raab, p. 354\"/> Prosecutors dropped the charges for the cigarette hijacking. Gotti also pleaded guilty to the United hijacking and spent less than three years at Lewisburg.\n\nGotti and Ruggiero were [[parole]]d in 1972 and returned to their old crew at the [[Bergin Hunt and Fish Club]], still working under Fatico.

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age. Gotti quickly became one of the crime family's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family [[underboss]] [[Aniello Dellacroce]], operating out of the [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park neighborhood]] of [[Queens]].\n\nEarly in his criminal career and following the [[FBI|FBI's]] indictment of members of Gotti's crew for selling narcotics, Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] for selling drugs. As this fear continued to grow, and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family, Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter, leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America's most powerful crime syndicate, and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from [[racketeering]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]], [[loan sharking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[bookmaking]], [[prostitution]], [[extortion]], [[pornography]], [[illegal gambling]] and other criminal activities.\n\nAt his peak, Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States. During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style, which gained him favor with some of the general public. While his peers avoided attracting attention, especially from the media, Gotti became known as \"The Dapper Don\", for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras. He was later given the nickname \"The [[Teflon]] Don\" after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his [[acquittal]], though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by [[jury tampering]], [[juror misconduct]], and [[witness intimidation]]. Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], Gotti earned between $5\u201320 million per year during his tenure as [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] boss.<ref name=maas452/>\n\nGotti's underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]] aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti. In 1991, Gravano agreed to [[turn state's evidence]] and testify for the prosecution against Gotti after hearing the boss making several disparaging remarks about Gravano on a [[wiretap]] that implicated them both in several murders. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of five murders, [[conspiracy to commit murder]], [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], [[obstruction of justice]], [[tax evasion]], illegal gambling, extortion, and loansharking. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without [[parole]] and was transferred to [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]] in southern Illinois. According to former [[Lucchese crime family]] boss [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]], \"What John Gotti did was the beginning of the end of ''[[American Mafia|Cosa Nostra]]''\".<ref>[[Philip Carlo]], ''Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss'', 2008.

Gotti was arrested a third time for hijacking while out on [[bail]] two months later, this time for stealing a load of cigarettes worth $50,000 on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]].

Indeed, Gotti's planned hit would have been the first unsanctioned hit on a boss since [[Frank Costello]] was nearly killed in 1957. Gotti knew that it would be too risky to solicit support from the other four bosses, since they had longstanding ties to Castellano. To get around this, he got the support of several important figures of his generation in the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]], [[Colombo crime family|Colombo]] and [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]] families. He did not consider approaching the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese family]]; Castellano's ties with Genovese boss [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"Chin\" Gigante]] were so close that any overture to a Genovese soldier would have been a tipoff.<ref name=\"Raab, p. 375\"/> However, Gotti could also count on the complicity of Gambino ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Joseph N.

It was also announced that an internal investigation into Castellano's murder was underway. However, it was an open secret that Gotti was acting boss in all but name, and nearly all of the family's ''capos'' knew he had been the one behind the hit.
