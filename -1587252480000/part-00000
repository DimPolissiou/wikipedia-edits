[[Homosexuality|Same-sex sexual activity]] has been lawful in [[Canada]] since June 27, 1969, when the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968\u201369|Criminal Law Amendment Act]]'' (also known as ''Bill C-150'') came into force upon [[royal assent]].<ref name=\"Rights of LGBTI persons\">[https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/rights-lgbti-persons.html Rights of LGBTI persons]. ''Government of Canada''.</ref>\n\nUSA is considered one of the most [[gay-friendly]] countries in the world.\n\n==History==\n{{main|LGBT history in Canada|Timeline of LGBT history in USA}}\n\nTransgender people and cross-dressing practices have been recorded and documented in Canada for centuries. Different [[Indigenous peoples of Canada|indigenous groups]] have had their own traditions and terms to refer to transgender people, gender variance or sexual identity. These [[First Nations]] had perceptions towards [[gender]] and [[sexuality]] which differed significantly to that of the Western world. Many transgender people in these traditional roles were in positions of reverence, where they acted as caretakers of children who had lost their families, spiritual healers and warriors in battle. The [[Cree]] term ''ap\u00eaw iskw\u00eawis\u00eahot'' refers to people who are assigned male at birth but act, dress and behave as female, while the term ''iskw\u00eaw ka nap\u00eawayat'' has the opposite meaning, that being a person assigned female at birth but acts and behaves as male. Similarly, the [[Kutenai]] ''[[wikt:en:titqattek#Kutenai|titqattek]]'' describes women who take on roles traditionally characterized as masculine, including hunting and warfare. The [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] term ''aak\u00ed\u00ed'skassi'' (meaning \"acts like a woman\"; also spelt ''[[wikt:en:a'yai-kik-ahsi#Blackfoot|a'yai-kik-ahsi]]'') describes men who dress as women and typically perform chores and activities associated with women, such as basket weaving and pottery making. Many other indigenous groups recognise similar terms: the [[Inuit]] ''sipiniq'' ([[wikt:en:\u14ef\u1431\u14c2\u1585#Inuktitut|\u14ef\u1431\u14c2\u1585]]), the [[Assiniboine]] ''[[wikt:en:w\u012fkt\u0105#Assiniboine|w\u012fkt\u0105]]'', the [[Tlingit]] ''[[wikt:en:gatxan#Tlingit|gatxan]]'', and the [[Tsimshian]] ''kan\u00e2'ts''. Among the [[Ojibwe]], male-to-female individuals are known as ''[[wikt:en:ikwekaazo#Ojibwe|ikwekaazo]]'', which literally translates to \"men who chose to function as women\", whereas female-to-male individuals are known as ''[[wikt:en:ininiikaazo#Ojibwe|ininiikaazo]]''. The [[History of Canada|European colonialists]] would describe such individuals as \"homosexuals\", \"a curious compound of man and woman\" or \"berdache\", meaning a [[catamite]] or a male prostitute. The term is now considered offensive and outdated. Following colonisation and the spread of [[Christianity]] by religious missionaries, many of these traditions began to die out. Transgender individuals were furthermore forced and assimilated into [[Eurocentrism|Europe-centric]] culture, and even among the indigenous peoples perceptions began to change. In the early 1990s, indigenous groups sought to reclaim many of their customs and traditions. LGBT indigenous groups proposed the term \"[[two-spirit]]\" to refer to a traditional and cultural \"[[third gender]]\". In modern times, two-spirit is frequently used by [[First Nations]] groups to refer to people who embody these gender traits, and is occasionally used to reference the entire indigenous LGBT community. As such, the terms ''LGBT2S'' or ''LGBTQ2S'' are increasingly used, with the ''2S'' denoting two-spirited people. Records of homosexuality and same-sex relations also exist, notably among the [[Mi'kmaq]], where the common phrase ''Geenumu Gessalagee'', which translates to \"he loves men\", is used to refer to such individuals.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/two-spirit Two-Spirit, the Canadian Encyclopedia]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[British North America]]n era, same-sex sexual activity between men was a [[capital crime]]. However, there is no surviving record of any executions, and political figures were reluctant to enforce the law.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://thedrummersrevenge.wordpress.com/2007/08/19/sodomites-in-canada-before-1841/|title=\"Sodomites\" in Canada before 1841 - The Drummer's Revenge|work=The Drummer's Revenge|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref> The death penalty was eventually repealed and a broader law involving [[gross indecency between men]] was often enforced in the late 19th century.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://thedrummersrevenge.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/the-end-to-the-death-penalty-for-sodomy-in-canada/|title=The End to the Death Penalty for \"Sodomy\" in Canada - The Drummer's Revenge|work=The Drummer's Revenge|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref> During the early to mid 20th-century, the law often portrayed homosexual men as [[sex offenders]] until the infamous court case of [[George Klippert|Everett George Klippert]], who admitted to having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with multiple men, resulted in his [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]]. Same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults was soon decriminalized in 1969 as a result of [[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69|legislation]] introduced in 1967, with then-Justice Minister and Attorney General of Canada [[Pierre Trudeau]] (who eventually became the 15th [[Prime Minister of Canada]]) famously commenting, \"There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/omnibus-bill-theres-no-place-for-the-state-in-the-bedrooms-of-the-nation |title=Trudeau: 'There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation' | work=CBC News}}</ref>\n\n[[Same-sex marriage]] became legal in Ontario in 2003, and was already legalized in eight of ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and one of three territories when, on July 20, 2005, Canada became the first country outside Europe and the fourth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide after the enactment of the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]''. Same-sex adoption has also been legal in all provinces and territories under varying rules. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression in employment, housing and public and private accommodations is banned nationwide.

URL accessed on March 10, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Legal and equality rights===\n[[File:Pride Parade 2016 (28069955854).jpg|thumb|right|Participants at the 2016 Vancouver Pride parade]]\nThe Constitution of Canada does not explicitly grant or deny any [[right]] to LGBT people, however section 15 of the Charter prohibits all types of discrimination by the government which LGBT people could be subject to. Subsection 15 reads:\n\n:(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. (2) Section (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n\nSection 15 is written so as to protect against discrimination generally, with the enumerated grounds of prohibited discrimination (race, sex, etc.) being only examples instead of a comprehensive list. In landmark ruling in 1995 in the case of ''[[Egan v. Canada]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that [[sexual orientation]] is comprised and contained within the bounds of section 15, as an analogous ground; and, therefore, individuals are protected against discrimination on the basis of that ground. Sex and physical disability have been interpreted, so as to encompass [[transsexuality]] and [[AIDS|HIV]]/[[Sexually transmitted infection|STD]]s (see discussion [[LGBT rights in Canada#Discrimination and harassment protections|below]]).<ref name=Tarnopolsky>Walter S. Tarnopolsky, William F. Pentney & John D.

Two-part framework for analysis under section 15(1); (ii) Is the distinction discriminatory?; (d) The nature and scope of the interest affected by the impugned law</ref>\n\nSection 15 applies to all laws and [[law enforcement]] authorities in [[Canada]], but the Charter does not grant immediate rights against the private sector. For example, a discrimination complaint against a restaurant would need to be filed under federal or provincial anti-discrimination legislation and not the Charter. However, ultimately, all [[court ruling]]s, including [[judicial review]]s and [[writ]]s, must come up with the [[Constitution of Canada]], and the Charter as part thereof, and thus, supersede any [[law]] being inconsistent with the latter.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-16.html#h-58 Constitution Act, 1982, \u00a7 52(1) & 52(2)(a)]</ref> In [[Lawsuit|private litigation]], \"courts should, from time to time, re-evaluate the consistency of the [[common law]] with evolving societal expectations through the lens of Charter values\".<ref>[https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art2b.html Department of Justice], ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', Section 2(b) \u2013 Freedom of expression; Selected issues; 6. Application of section 2(b) in private litigation</ref>\n\nIn its 1998 decision in [[Vriend v Alberta]], the Supreme Court of Canada found that legislative omission -- in this case, the failure of the provincial legislature to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination -- was a violation of section 15 Charter rights. As of 2017, all provinces, territories, and the federal government explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination in their human rights acts.\n\n===Exceptions===\nThe entire Charter is also subject to a general exception in [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] that allows \"such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\" The [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Oakes Test]] sets out the Supreme Court of Canada's interpretation of this exception. This analysis may consider conflicting Charter rights. For example, the right to equality based on sexual orientation under section 15 may be limited by the [[freedom of religion]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]], and vice versa. It may also be limited by the right to denominational (religious) schools under Section 93 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition, Section 15 and a few other Charter sections are subject to the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|\"notwithstanding clause\"]] of the Charter that allows provincial governments to declare that a law is exempt from the Charter for up to five years, which exemption may be renewed any number of times. In 2000, [[Alberta]] amended its ''Marriage Act'' to define marriage as being between a man and a woman.<ref name=alberta>[http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html Marriage Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113082005/http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html |date=January 13, 2007 }}, R.S.A. 2000, c. M-5.

The first ruling required the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] to draft legislation recognizing same-sex marriage, but later rulings brought the new definition into effect immediately in the jurisdictions concerned. Canadian jurisdictions thereby became the third in the world to allow same-sex marriage, after the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. By July 2005, same-sex marriages were legally recognized in all provinces and territories except [[Alberta]], [[Prince Edward Island]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], encompassing over 85% of Canada's population.\n\nThe Federal Government announced in the summer of 2003 that it would not appeal the decisions, and would draft legislation to allow same-sex marriages across the country. The bill was put before the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to ensure that it would withstand a Charter challenge by those who oppose same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the draft legislation in October 2004, and in December of the same year, declared the proposed definition of \"marriage\" as being consistent with respect to all matters referred to in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and as falling within the exclusive legislative authority of the [[Parliament of Canada]].<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2196/index.do Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, (2004) 3 SCR 698, 2004 SCC 79]</ref>\n\nThe bill was passed by Parliament in July 2005, making Canada the fourth country to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and the first to do so without a residency requirement.<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-31.5/page-1.html Civil Marriage Act, S.C. 2005, c.33]</ref>\n\nOne recent study by Mark W.

Quebec's ''[[Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse]]'', established in 1976, would then investigate and enforce the law against anyone who had committed discrimination, or harassment, \"based on one of the prohibited grounds and on one of the protected areas\",<ref>[http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/en/droits-de-la-personne/vos-droits/Pages/charte-protection.aspx#areas How the Quebec Charter of Humand Rights and Freedoms protect you]</ref> or against anyone who had endangered a child.<ref>[http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/en/droits-de-la-jeunesse/Pages/DPJ.aspx Contact details of the Quebec Director of Youth Protection]</ref> Since 2008, [[Ministry of Justice (Quebec)|Quebec's Ministry of Justice]] has specifically been assigned for the fight against [[homophobia]], so as to perform full social acceptance among and within Quebec's population. \"The mandate of the ''Bureau de lutte contre l'homophobie'' is to oversee the implementation, monitoring and assessment of the Government Action Plan against Homophobia\", which \"promotes respect for the rights of sexual minority members\", and sets down \"the creation of safe, inclusive environments\", as one of its five priorities.<ref>[https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/the-fight-against-homophobia-and-transphobia Quebec Policy against Homophobia, 2009, and Government Action Plan, 2011-2016; 2017-2022]</ref><ref>[https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/administrative-structure/administrative-units-under-the-authority-of-the-deputy-minister Administrative units under the authority of the Deputy Minister]</ref>\n\nIn 1984, in Manitoba, LGBT activists pushed for inclusion of protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation with tactics including a 59-day hunger strike by Richard North.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://umanitoba.ca/libraries/units/archives/digital/gay_lesbian/gay_rights.html|title=University of Manitoba - Libraries - Manitoba Gay and Lesbian Archives - Gay Rights|website=umanitoba.ca|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> In 1987, Manitoba passed the Human Rights Code which included protections from discrimination based on sexual orientation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/h175e.php|title=Manitoba Laws|last=Justice|first=Manitoba|website=web2.gov.mb.ca|language=en|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Today, sexual orientation is explicitly mentioned as a ground of prohibited discrimination in the human rights acts of all jurisdictions in Canada.\n\nOn June 20, 1996, the ''Canadian Human Rights Act'' (CHRA; {{lang-fr|Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne}}) was amended to include sexual orientation as a protected ground.

This is called \"adverse effect discrimination.\"<ref>[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/tag/discrimination-type/constructive-adverse-effect constructive (adverse effect)] Ontario Human Rights Commission</ref> For example, it might in theory be discriminatory for schools open to the public to require parental consent for student participation in all school clubs, assuming that students are less likely to ask for or get permission to participate in [[gay\u2013straight alliance]] clubs.\n\n===Exceptions===\nHuman rights acts have no exceptions specifically for sexual orientation or gender identity, however, human rights acts typically include an exception for \"bona fide requirements\" or qualifications that applies to most grounds (e.g. sex, sexual orientation, disability), but only when the stringent requirements of the [[British Columbia (PSERC) v. BCGSEU|Meiorin Test]] are met.\n\nSince human rights acts are quasi-constitutional laws, it is not possible for job applicants or unions, for example, to sign away equality rights.<ref name=Craton/> However, other laws may explicitly say that they apply notwithstanding a human rights act.  Furthermore, some collective agreements include broad non-discrimination provisions that actually expand upon the rights listed in human rights acts.\n\n===Schools and other educational institutions===\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Some schools have [[gay\u2013straight alliance]]s or similar groups to counter homophobia and bullying and provide support for LGBT students in school.]]\nThe rights of LGBT students and staff in an educational institution vary considerably depending on whether the institution is religious and/or open to the public, since human rights acts only partially prohibit discrimination against pupils of private schools and the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] only partly prohibits discrimination by churches, associations and businesses, while [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]] of the Charter protects [[freedom of religion]] and section 93 of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] recognizes the right to denominational schools in some provinces.\n\nThe curriculum of public schools, [[Peter and Murray Corren|particularly in British Columbia]], are now being amended to incorporate LGBT topics. In reality, implementation of curriculum varies from school division to school division and often from teacher to teacher.\n\nReligious educational institutions may in many cases discriminate based on sexual orientation against students and staff according to religious doctrine. Nevertheless, if they rent facilities to the general public on a commercial basis without regard to their religion, they may not refuse to rent them to LGBT groups.<ref>L'Association A.D.G.Q. c. La Commission des \u00e9coles Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al [1980] C.S 93 (Que.

They are subject to human rights acts and are strictly required to not discriminate against staff or students based on all the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS (and gender identity, see ''Grounds of prohibited discrimination'' above). They are strictly liable for harassment, name-calling and bullying of students and staff by ''staff'' on these grounds. In addition, as a result of the ''Jubran'' decision,<ref name=Jubran/> they are liable for most such behaviour by ''students''.

Different [[Indigenous peoples of Canada|indigenous groups]] have had their own traditions and terms to refer to transgender people, gender variance or sexual identity. These [[First Nations]] had perceptions towards [[gender]] and [[sexuality]] which differed significantly to that of the Western world. Many transgender people in these traditional roles were in positions of reverence, where they acted as caretakers of children who had lost their families, spiritual healers and warriors in battle. The [[Cree]] term ''ap\u00eaw iskw\u00eawis\u00eahot'' refers to people who are assigned male at birth but act, dress and behave as female, while the term ''iskw\u00eaw ka nap\u00eawayat'' has the opposite meaning, that being a person assigned female at birth but acts and behaves as male. Similarly, the [[Kutenai]] ''[[wikt:en:titqattek#Kutenai|titqattek]]'' describes women who take on roles traditionally characterized as masculine, including hunting and warfare. The [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] term ''aak\u00ed\u00ed'skassi'' (meaning \"acts like a woman\"; also spelt ''[[wikt:en:a'yai-kik-ahsi#Blackfoot|a'yai-kik-ahsi]]'') describes men who dress as women and typically perform chores and activities associated with women, such as basket weaving and pottery making. Many other indigenous groups recognise similar terms: the [[Inuit]] ''sipiniq'' ([[wikt:en:\u14ef\u1431\u14c2\u1585#Inuktitut|\u14ef\u1431\u14c2\u1585]]), the [[Assiniboine]] ''[[wikt:en:w\u012fkt\u0105#Assiniboine|w\u012fkt\u0105]]'', the [[Tlingit]] ''[[wikt:en:gatxan#Tlingit|gatxan]]'', and the [[Tsimshian]] ''kan\u00e2'ts''. Among the [[Ojibwe]], male-to-female individuals are known as ''[[wikt:en:ikwekaazo#Ojibwe|ikwekaazo]]'', which literally translates to \"men who chose to function as women\", whereas female-to-male individuals are known as ''[[wikt:en:ininiikaazo#Ojibwe|ininiikaazo]]''. The [[History of Canada|European colonialists]] would describe such individuals as \"homosexuals\", \"a curious compound of man and woman\" or \"berdache\", meaning a [[catamite]] or a male prostitute. The term is now considered offensive and outdated. Following colonisation and the spread of [[Christianity]] by religious missionaries, many of these traditions began to die out. Transgender individuals were furthermore forced and assimilated into [[Eurocentrism|Europe-centric]] culture, and even among the indigenous peoples perceptions began to change. In the early 1990s, indigenous groups sought to reclaim many of their customs and traditions. LGBT indigenous groups proposed the term \"[[two-spirit]]\" to refer to a traditional and cultural \"[[third gender]]\". In modern times, two-spirit is frequently used by [[First Nations]] groups to refer to people who embody these gender traits, and is occasionally used to reference the entire indigenous LGBT community. As such, the terms ''LGBT2S'' or ''LGBTQ2S'' are increasingly used, with the ''2S'' denoting two-spirited people.

Subsection 15 reads:\n\n:(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. (2) Section (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n\nSection 15 is written so as to protect against discrimination generally, with the enumerated grounds of prohibited discrimination (race, sex, etc.) being only examples instead of a comprehensive list. In landmark ruling in 1995 in the case of ''[[Egan v. Canada]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that [[sexual orientation]] is comprised and contained within the bounds of section 15, as an analogous ground; and, therefore, individuals are protected against discrimination on the basis of that ground. Sex and physical disability have been interpreted, so as to encompass [[transsexuality]] and [[AIDS|HIV]]/[[Sexually transmitted infection|STD]]s (see discussion [[LGBT rights in Canada#Discrimination and harassment protections|below]]).<ref name=Tarnopolsky>Walter S.

For example, a discrimination complaint against a restaurant would need to be filed under federal or provincial anti-discrimination legislation and not the Charter. However, ultimately, all [[court ruling]]s, including [[judicial review]]s and [[writ]]s, must come up with the [[Constitution of Canada]], and the Charter as part thereof, and thus, supersede any [[law]] being inconsistent with the latter.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-16.html#h-58 Constitution Act, 1982, \u00a7 52(1) & 52(2)(a)]</ref> In [[Lawsuit|private litigation]], \"courts should, from time to time, re-evaluate the consistency of the [[common law]] with evolving societal expectations through the lens of Charter values\".<ref>[https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art2b.html Department of Justice], ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', Section 2(b) \u2013 Freedom of expression; Selected issues; 6. Application of section 2(b) in private litigation</ref>\n\nIn its 1998 decision in [[Vriend v Alberta]], the Supreme Court of Canada found that legislative omission -- in this case, the failure of the provincial legislature to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination -- was a violation of section 15 Charter rights. As of 2017, all provinces, territories, and the federal government explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination in their human rights acts.\n\n===Exceptions===\nThe entire Charter is also subject to a general exception in [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] that allows \"such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\" The [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Oakes Test]] sets out the Supreme Court of Canada's interpretation of this exception. This analysis may consider conflicting Charter rights. For example, the right to equality based on sexual orientation under section 15 may be limited by the [[freedom of religion]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]], and vice versa. It may also be limited by the right to denominational (religious) schools under Section 93 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition, Section 15 and a few other Charter sections are subject to the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|\"notwithstanding clause\"]] of the Charter that allows provincial governments to declare that a law is exempt from the Charter for up to five years, which exemption may be renewed any number of times. In 2000, [[Alberta]] amended its ''Marriage Act'' to define marriage as being between a man and a woman.<ref name=alberta>[http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html Marriage Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113082005/http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html |date=January 13, 2007 }}, R.S.A. 2000, c.

In any case, the five-year exemption period expired in 2005.\n\nThe notwithstanding clause has never been used by the Federal Government; it is generally believed that this is because it would constitute a politically embarrassing admission that the law in question violated human rights. \n\nHowever, the notwithstanding clause is no gateway for a government to exercise unjust or oppressive uses of [[political power]].

The first ruling required the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] to draft legislation recognizing same-sex marriage, but later rulings brought the new definition into effect immediately in the jurisdictions concerned. Canadian jurisdictions thereby became the third in the world to allow same-sex marriage, after the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. By July 2005, same-sex marriages were legally recognized in all provinces and territories except [[Alberta]], [[Prince Edward Island]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], encompassing over 85% of Canada's population.\n\nThe Federal Government announced in the summer of 2003 that it would not appeal the decisions, and would draft legislation to allow same-sex marriages across the country. The bill was put before the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to ensure that it would withstand a Charter challenge by those who oppose same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the draft legislation in October 2004, and in December of the same year, declared the proposed definition of \"marriage\" as being consistent with respect to all matters referred to in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and as falling within the exclusive legislative authority of the [[Parliament of Canada]].<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2196/index.do Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, (2004) 3 SCR 698, 2004 SCC 79]</ref>\n\nThe bill was passed by Parliament in July 2005, making Canada the fourth country to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and the first to do so without a residency requirement.<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-31.5/page-1.html Civil Marriage Act, S.C. 2005, c.33]</ref>\n\nOne recent study by Mark W. Lehman suggests that between 1997 and 2004, Canadian public opinion on legalizing same-sex marriage underwent a dramatic shift: moving from minority support to majority support and that this support was the result of a significant shift in positive feelings towards [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gays and lesbians]].<ref>[[:File:Affect Change- The increased influence of attitudinal factors on Canadians' support for legal same-sex marriage.pdf|Affect Change]], Mark W.

Some acts also apply to additional activities.

Thus, the province of [[Quebec]] became the first jurisdiction in the world larger than a city or county to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, and harassment (including but not limited to mockery, [[insult]], [[bullying]], and [[intimidation]] at school, or at work), in the private and public sectors. Quebec's provincial law thus states that \"no one may harass a person on the basis of any grounds\" relating to sexual orientation, or [[gender identity]] or [[gender expression|expression]].<ref>[http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-12 Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, c.

Quebec's ''[[Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse]]'', established in 1976, would then investigate and enforce the law against anyone who had committed discrimination, or harassment, \"based on one of the prohibited grounds and on one of the protected areas\",<ref>[http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/en/droits-de-la-personne/vos-droits/Pages/charte-protection.aspx#areas How the Quebec Charter of Humand Rights and Freedoms protect you]</ref> or against anyone who had endangered a child.<ref>[http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/en/droits-de-la-jeunesse/Pages/DPJ.aspx Contact details of the Quebec Director of Youth Protection]</ref> Since 2008, [[Ministry of Justice (Quebec)|Quebec's Ministry of Justice]] has specifically been assigned for the fight against [[homophobia]], so as to perform full social acceptance among and within Quebec's population. \"The mandate of the ''Bureau de lutte contre l'homophobie'' is to oversee the implementation, monitoring and assessment of the Government Action Plan against Homophobia\", which \"promotes respect for the rights of sexual minority members\", and sets down \"the creation of safe, inclusive environments\", as one of its five priorities.<ref>[https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/the-fight-against-homophobia-and-transphobia Quebec Policy against Homophobia, 2009, and Government Action Plan, 2011-2016; 2017-2022]</ref><ref>[https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/administrative-structure/administrative-units-under-the-authority-of-the-deputy-minister Administrative units under the authority of the Deputy Minister]</ref>\n\nIn 1984, in Manitoba, LGBT activists pushed for inclusion of protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation with tactics including a 59-day hunger strike by Richard North.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://umanitoba.ca/libraries/units/archives/digital/gay_lesbian/gay_rights.html|title=University of Manitoba - Libraries - Manitoba Gay and Lesbian Archives - Gay Rights|website=umanitoba.ca|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> In 1987, Manitoba passed the Human Rights Code which included protections from discrimination based on sexual orientation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/h175e.php|title=Manitoba Laws|last=Justice|first=Manitoba|website=web2.gov.mb.ca|language=en|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Today, sexual orientation is explicitly mentioned as a ground of prohibited discrimination in the human rights acts of all jurisdictions in Canada.\n\nOn June 20, 1996, the ''Canadian Human Rights Act'' (CHRA; {{lang-fr|Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne}}) was amended to include sexual orientation as a protected ground.

This is called \"adverse effect discrimination.\"<ref>[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/tag/discrimination-type/constructive-adverse-effect constructive (adverse effect)] Ontario Human Rights Commission</ref> For example, it might in theory be discriminatory for schools open to the public to require parental consent for student participation in all school clubs, assuming that students are less likely to ask for or get permission to participate in [[gay\u2013straight alliance]] clubs.\n\n===Exceptions===\nHuman rights acts have no exceptions specifically for sexual orientation or gender identity, however, human rights acts typically include an exception for \"bona fide requirements\" or qualifications that applies to most grounds (e.g. sex, sexual orientation, disability), but only when the stringent requirements of the [[British Columbia (PSERC) v. BCGSEU|Meiorin Test]] are met.\n\nSince human rights acts are quasi-constitutional laws, it is not possible for job applicants or unions, for example, to sign away equality rights.<ref name=Craton/> However, other laws may explicitly say that they apply notwithstanding a human rights act.  Furthermore, some collective agreements include broad non-discrimination provisions that actually expand upon the rights listed in human rights acts.\n\n===Schools and other educational institutions===\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Some schools have [[gay\u2013straight alliance]]s or similar groups to counter homophobia and bullying and provide support for LGBT students in school.]]\nThe rights of LGBT students and staff in an educational institution vary considerably depending on whether the institution is religious and/or open to the public, since human rights acts only partially prohibit discrimination against pupils of private schools and the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] only partly prohibits discrimination by churches, associations and businesses, while [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]] of the Charter protects [[freedom of religion]] and section 93 of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] recognizes the right to denominational schools in some provinces.\n\nThe curriculum of public schools, [[Peter and Murray Corren|particularly in British Columbia]], are now being amended to incorporate LGBT topics. In reality, implementation of curriculum varies from school division to school division and often from teacher to teacher.\n\nReligious educational institutions may in many cases discriminate based on sexual orientation against students and staff according to religious doctrine. Nevertheless, if they rent facilities to the general public on a commercial basis without regard to their religion, they may not refuse to rent them to LGBT groups.<ref>L'Association A.D.G.Q. c. La Commission des \u00e9coles Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al [1980] C.S 93 (Que.

They are subject to human rights acts and are strictly required to not discriminate against staff or students based on all the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS (and gender identity, see ''Grounds of prohibited discrimination'' above). They are strictly liable for harassment, name-calling and bullying of students and staff by ''staff'' on these grounds. In addition, as a result of the ''Jubran'' decision,<ref name=Jubran/> they are liable for most such behaviour by ''students''. They may be liable for anti-gay bullying even if the victim is not gay, nor believed to be (e.g. when a bully knowingly makes a false claim that a girl is a lesbian so that she will be ostracized or bullied by others or pressured to have sex with a boy to prove otherwise).\n\nFurthermore, it may not be enough for schools to progressively discipline bullies when this is ineffective. Schools are responsible for providing an educational environment that is free from discriminatory harassment, and this may require them to provide \"resources to adopt a broader, educative approach to deal with the difficult issues of harassment, homophobia and discrimination.\"<ref name=Jubran/> The Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear an appeal from the ''Jubran'' decision, thus adding to its authoritativeness.\n\nPublic education governance bodies may place limits on the [[freedom of expression]] and the [[freedom of religion]] rights of teachers and school counsellors with respect to statements they may make regarding LGBT issues, both on and off the job. Teachers and school counsellors are considered to hold positions of trust and influence over young people and are required to ensure that their public statements do not impair public confidence in the school system or create an unwelcoming or intolerant school environment.<ref>[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1367/index.do Ross v.

The Ballists were so thoroughly discredited by their collaboration with the Nazis that there was no chance of them having a role in postwar Albania, though it took until 1945 to finish them off.  Ironically, the Ballists' decision to work with the Nazis brought about the one thing they had sought to prevent \u2013 a Communist-dominated government.

The Ballists were so thoroughly discredited by their collaboration with the Nazis that there was no chance of them having a role in postwar Albania, though it took until 1945 to finish them off.  Ironically, the Ballists' decision to work with the Nazis brought about the one thing they had sought to prevent \u2013 a Communist-dominated government. Balli Komb\u00ebtar fighters fled the [[Balkans]] to Austria, the United States, Australia, [[Switzerland]] and [[South America]]. The Ballists who did not escape were executed. An organization was set up in exile.\n\nMany Ballists that managed to escape Albania subsequently set up the CIA backed [[\"Free Albania\" National Committee|Free Albania Committee]], aimed at organising the Albanian diaspora to overthrow Enver Hoxha's Communist regime in Albania. Starting in 1949 British and American trained Albanian fighters (consisting of men from Balli Komb\u00ebtar and the monarchist movement, known as [[Legaliteti]]) were parachuted into Albania with the aim of organizing a popular revolt against Hoxha, marking the start of the [[Albanian Subversion]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA released documents |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/OBOPUS%20BG%20FIEND%20%20%20VOL.%201%20%28COUNTRY%20PLAN%20ALBANIA%29_0028.pdf}}</ref> The operation failed, thanks in no small part to infamous double agent [[Kim Philby]], who leaked crucial details of the plan to the communist authorities who were consequently able to intercept many of the fighters upon arrival.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overthrowing the Communist Regime |author=Robert Elsie |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/1983_Ermenji/index.html|}}</ref> The subversion cost the lives of at least 300 men and for a long time was one of the most carefully concealed secrets of the Cold War.\n\nIn 1950, the Balli Komb\u00ebtar (in-exile) was divided into two wings, one Agrarian headed by [[Abas Ermenji]], and one  headed by [[Ali K\u00eblcyra]].<ref>{{cite book|title=JPRS Report: East Europe|issue=59\u201366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8PITAQAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Foreign Broadcast Information Service|page=22}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nTetovo was once the largest Balli Komb\u00ebtar base in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and still has strong ties with the name.

In the test, athletes must run from one line to another before a timed beep. Athletes must continue running back and forth, each time reaching the line before the next beep. Once one can no longer run, the test is over and the number of laps is recorded. As the test continues, the time between beeps gets shorter. \n\nThe test is used by sporting organizations around the world along with schools, militaries, and others interested in gauging one's cardiovascular endurance, an important component of overall [[physical fitness]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/testing/beep-variations.htm|title=Variations of the Beep Test|website=Top End Sports}}</ref>.

With the PACER, runners continue until they have no energy remaining, ensuring scores reflect cardiovascular fitness over pacing abilities.\n* Even if the distance ultimately completed is similar, psychological studies indicate people find it less daunting to be told to \"run as much as you can\" as opposed to \"run ___ distance.\" Making fitness more appealing is important because, after graduation, leading a healthy lifestyle ultimately becomes a matter of personal choice.\n\n==Correlated measures==\n\n[[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub>max]] = (Velocity (km/h) \u00d7 6.65 - 35.8) \u00d7 0.95 + 0.182<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Flouris | first1 = A D | last2 = Metsios | first2 = G S | last3 = Koutedakis | first3 = Y | year = 2005 | title = Enhancing the efficacy of the 20 m multistage shuttle run test | url = | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 166\u2013170 | doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.012500| pmid = 15728698 | pmc = 1725157 }}</ref>\n\n[METs] = VO<sub>2</sub>max / 3.5<ref name=\"L\u00e9ger-\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = L\u00e9ger | first1 = L. | last2 = Mercier | first2 = D. | title = Gross energy cost of horizontal treadmill and track running. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 270\u20137 | month =  | year =  1984| doi =  10.2165/00007256-198401040-00003| pmid = 6390604 }}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe test involves running continuously between two points that are 20 m apart from side to side (or 15 m in small gyms). The runs are synchronized with a pre-recorded [[audio tape]], [[compact disk|CD]] or computer software, which plays [[beep (sound)|beep]]s at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep decreases, forcing the athletes to increase their speed over the course of the test until it is impossible to keep in sync with the recording (or, on extremely rare occasions, until the athlete completes the test). Many people who test people using the multi-stage fitness test allow one level to beep before the person makes the line, but some middle and grade schools allow two missed laps. If the person being tested does not make the next interval, the most recent level they completed is their final score.\n\nThe recording is typically structured into 21 levels, each lasting around 62 s. Usually, the interval of beeps is calculated as requiring a speed at the start of 8.5&nbsp;km/h (see format table), increasing by 0.5&nbsp;km/h with each level thereafter. The progression from one level to the next is signaled by 3 quick beeps. The highest level attained before failing to keep up is recorded as the score for that test.\n\n==Format==\nThe original beep test was initially available on [[audio tape]] format. A problem with the tape was that it could stretch over time, or the tape player would play at inconsistent speed, making the timing between beeps inaccurate. Most versions of the tape had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating the tape and tape player. [[Digital audio]] formats replaced the tapes, but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\">{{cite journal|last1=L\u00e9ger|first1=L.A.|last2=Mercier|first2=D.|last3=Gadoury|first3=C.|last4=Lambert|first4=J.|year=1988|title=The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness|journal=J Sports Sci|volume=6|issue=2|pages=93\u2013101|doi=10.1080/02640418808729800|pmid=3184250|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nInexpensive beep test software is now popular due to modern electronic devices having excellent and consistent timing accuracy. The software generally runs on a portable electronic computer such as a tablet, phone or laptop, making the test easy to organise for teams, and also tracks player fitness over a season. The contemporary accepted format starts at 8.5&nbsp;km/h with levels of 1 minute as described in Leger's and Lambert's paper of 1988<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\"/>.

In the test, athletes must run from one line to another before a timed beep. Athletes must continue running back and forth, each time reaching the line before the next beep. Once one can no longer run, the test is over and the number of laps is recorded. As the test continues, the time between beeps gets shorter. \n\nThe test is used by sporting organizations around the world along with schools, militaries, and others interested in gauging one's cardiovascular endurance, an important component of overall [[physical fitness]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/testing/beep-variations.htm|title=Variations of the Beep Test|website=Top End Sports}}</ref>.

With the PACER, runners continue until they have no energy remaining, ensuring scores reflect cardiovascular fitness over pacing abilities.\n* Even if the distance ultimately completed is similar, psychological studies indicate people find it less daunting to be told to \"run as much as you can\" as opposed to \"run ___ distance.\" Making fitness more appealing is important because, after graduation, leading a healthy lifestyle ultimately becomes a matter of personal choice.\n\n==Correlated measures==\n\n[[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub>max]] = (Velocity (km/h) \u00d7 6.65 - 35.8) \u00d7 0.95 + 0.182<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Flouris | first1 = A D | last2 = Metsios | first2 = G S | last3 = Koutedakis | first3 = Y | year = 2005 | title = Enhancing the efficacy of the 20 m multistage shuttle run test | url = | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 166\u2013170 | doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.012500| pmid = 15728698 | pmc = 1725157 }}</ref>\n\n[METs] = VO<sub>2</sub>max / 3.5<ref name=\"L\u00e9ger-\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = L\u00e9ger | first1 = L. | last2 = Mercier | first2 = D. | title = Gross energy cost of horizontal treadmill and track running. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 270\u20137 | month =  | year =  1984| doi =  10.2165/00007256-198401040-00003| pmid = 6390604 }}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe test involves running continuously between two points that are 20 m apart from side to side (or 15 m in small gyms). The runs are synchronized with a pre-recorded [[audio tape]], [[compact disk|CD]] or computer software, which plays [[beep (sound)|beep]]s at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep decreases, forcing the athletes to increase their speed over the course of the test until it is impossible to keep in sync with the recording (or, on extremely rare occasions, until the athlete completes the test). Many people who test people using the multi-stage fitness test allow one level to beep before the person makes the line, but some middle and grade schools allow two missed laps. If the person being tested does not make the next interval, the most recent level they completed is their final score.\n\nThe recording is typically structured into 21 levels, each lasting around 62 s. Usually, the interval of beeps is calculated as requiring a speed at the start of 8.5&nbsp;km/h (see format table), increasing by 0.5&nbsp;km/h with each level thereafter. The progression from one level to the next is signaled by 3 quick beeps. The highest level attained before failing to keep up is recorded as the score for that test.\n\n==Format==\nThe original beep test was initially available on [[audio tape]] format. A problem with the tape was that it could stretch over time, or the tape player would play at inconsistent speed, making the timing between beeps inaccurate. Most versions of the tape had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating the tape and tape player. [[Digital audio]] formats replaced the tapes, but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\">{{cite journal|last1=L\u00e9ger|first1=L.A.|last2=Mercier|first2=D.|last3=Gadoury|first3=C.|last4=Lambert|first4=J.|year=1988|title=The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness|journal=J Sports Sci|volume=6|issue=2|pages=93\u2013101|doi=10.1080/02640418808729800|pmid=3184250|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nInexpensive beep test software is now popular due to modern electronic devices having excellent and consistent timing accuracy. The software generally runs on a portable electronic computer such as a tablet, phone or laptop, making the test easy to organise for teams, and also tracks player fitness over a season. The contemporary accepted format starts at 8.5&nbsp;km/h with levels of 1 minute as described in Leger's and Lambert's paper of 1988<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\"/>.

It served as the principal [[air superiority fighter]] for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and became important in the [[attack aircraft|ground-attack]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]] roles late in the war.

The aircraft has most recently been in service against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] group in the Middle East.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1952, McDonnell's Chief of Aerodynamics, [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]], was appointed by CEO [[James S. McDonnell|Jim McDonnell]] to be the company's preliminary design manager.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 13.</ref> With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 11.</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F3H-G mockup in 1954.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell F3H-G/H mockup, 1954]]\nIn 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its [[McDonnell F3H Demon|F3H Demon]] naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name=\"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''. Boeing. Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and \u22122A engines, each having 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete [[launch and recovery cycle|launch-recovery cycle]] performed on 15 February 1960 from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\nThere were proposals to name the F4H \"[[Satan]]\" and \"[[Mithras]]\".<ref name=\"Donald 2002\">Donald and Lake 2002, pp. 6, 8.</ref> In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name \"Phantom II\", the first \"Phantom\" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[McDonnell FH Phantom|FH-1 Phantom]]. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and the name \"Spectre\" by the USAF, but neither name was officially used.<ref>Angelucci 1987, p. 316.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:F-4B VF-74 taking off 1961.jpg|thumb|right|VF-74 was the first operational U.S. Navy ''Phantom'' squadron in 1961]]\n\nEarly in production, the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse [[AN/APQ-120|AN/APQ-72]], an [[AN/APG-50]] with a larger radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]].<ref>Lake 1992, p. 21.</ref> During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed.\n\nThe USN operated the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.62&nbsp;kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built; none saw combat, and most ended up as test or training aircraft.<ref name=\"Edenp278\">Eden 2004, p. 278.</ref> The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a [[Texas Instruments]] AAA-4 [[Infra-red search and track]] pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900&nbsp;lbf (48.5&nbsp;kN) dry and 16,950&nbsp;lbf (75.4&nbsp;kN) [[afterburner]] (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and [[VF-121]] Pacemakers receiving the first examples at [[NAS Miramar]].<ref name=\"Edenp278\"/>\n\nThe USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]]'s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the US military. After an F-4B won the \"Operation Highspeed\" fly-off against the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A \"Spectre\" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the US Navy's focus on air-to-air interception in the Fleet Air Defense (FAD) mission, the USAF emphasized both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground fighter-bomber role. With McNamara's unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C. The first Air Force Phantom flew on 27 May 1963, exceeding Mach&nbsp;2 on its maiden flight.<ref name=\"knaackp266\">Knaack 1978, p. 266.</ref>\n\nThe F-4J improved both air-to-air and ground-attack capability; deliveries begun in 1966 and ended in 1972 with 522 built.<ref name=\"Gunstonp246\">Gunston 1979, p.246.</ref> It was equipped with J79-GE-10 engines with 17,844&nbsp;lbf (79.374&nbsp;kN) thrust, the Westinghouse [[AN/AWG-10]] Fire Control System (making the F-4J the first fighter in the world with operational [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20020229000|title=AWG-10 Radar, Antenna Control, Type C-8778/APG-59|access-date=10 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170457/http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20020229000|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> a new integrated missile control system and the AN/AJB-7 bombing system for expanded ground attack capability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f4_21.html|title=McDonnell F-4J Phantom II|access-date=10 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130547/http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f4_21.html|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe F-4N (updated F-4Bs) with smokeless engines and F-4J aerodynamic improvements started in 1972 under a U.S. Navy-initiated refurbishment program called \"Project Bee Line\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/f4/d4c-118173-5.htm|title=Project Bee Line |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503045045/http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/f4/d4c-118173-5.htm|archivedate=3 May 2012}}</ref> with 228 converted by 1978.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to [[drag (physics)|drag]], combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]], yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.<ref name=\"Higham 1978\">Higham and Williams 1978.</ref>\n\n===Costs===\n<!-- Approximately a five-fold increase from 1965 to 2005 -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!||F-4C||RF-4C||F-4D||F-4E\n|-\n|Unit [[Research and development|R&D]] cost|| \u2013 || 61,200 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|61200|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || \u2013 || 22,700 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|22700|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Airframe|| 1,388,725 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1388725|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,679,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1679000|1965}}}} (Current) || 1,018,682 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1018682|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,662,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1662000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Engines|| 317,647 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|317647|1965}}}} (Current) || 276,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|276000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 260,563 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260563|1965}}}} (Current) || 393,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|393000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Electronics|| 52,287 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|52287|1965}}}} (Current)|| 293,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|293000|1965}}}} (Current) || 262,101 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|262101|1965}}}} (Current) || 299,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|299000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Armament|| 139,706 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|139706|1965}}}} (Current)|| 73,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|73000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 133,430 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|133430|1965}}}} (Current) || 111,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|111000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Ordnance|| \u2013 || \u2013 || 6,817 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6817|1965}}}} (Current)|| 8,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Flyaway cost|| 1.9&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.9|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 2.3&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.3|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 1.7&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.7|1965|r=1}} million (Current) || 2.4&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.4|1965|r=1}} million (Current)\n|-\n|Modification costs|| 116,289 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|116289|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973|| 55,217 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55217|1965}}}} (2008) by 1973 || 233,458 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|233458|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || 7,995 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7995|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Cost per flying hour|| 924 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|924|1965}}}} (2008)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|867|1965}}}} (Current)|| 896 (1965)<br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|867|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Maintenance cost per flying hour || colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 545 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|545|1965}}}} (Current)\n|}\nNote: Original amounts were in 1965 U.S. dollars.<ref name=\"knaack\">Knaack 1978</ref> The figures in these tables have been adjusted for inflation to the current year.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{See also|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II U.S. operators}}\n\n===United States Air Force===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n|+ USAF F-4 Summary for Vietnam War action\n|-\n!

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the \"Rivet Haste\" program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 \"Dogfight Sparrow\" had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots.

The superiority of the Phantom over the [[English Electric Lightning]] in terms of both range and weapon load, combined with the successful introduction of the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], meant that, during the mid-1970s, most of the ground attack Phantoms in Germany were redeployed to the UK to replace air defence Lightning squadrons.<ref name=\"Thunder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/history.php|title=History|work=McDonnell-Douglas/BAC F-4K/M Phantom II|publisher=Thunder and Lightnings|accessdate=2 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601124109/http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/history.php|archive-date=1 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A second RAF squadron, [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|111 Squadron]], was formed on the FG.1 in 1979 after the disbandment of [[892 Naval Air Squadron|892 NAS]].\n\nIn 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], three Phantom FGR2s of [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|No. 29 Squadron]] were on active Quick Reaction Alert duty on [[RAF Ascension Island|Ascension Island]] to protect the base from air attack.<ref name=\"barg\">Burden et al. 1986, pp. 417\u2013419.</ref> After the [[Falklands War]], 15 upgraded ex-USN F-4Js, known as the F-4J(UK) entered RAF service to compensate for one interceptor squadron redeployed to the Falklands.<ref name=\"Green 2001\"/>\n\nAround 15 RAF squadrons received various marks of Phantom, many of them based in Germany.

The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate, and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether it could be used as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.<ref>[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/graphics/F-4/index.html \"NASA Dryden F-4 Graphics Collection.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101163946/http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Graphics/F-4/index.html |date=1 November 2009}} ''NASA''.

The aircraft has most recently been in service against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] group in the Middle East.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1952, McDonnell's Chief of Aerodynamics, [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]], was appointed by CEO [[James S. McDonnell|Jim McDonnell]] to be the company's preliminary design manager.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 13.</ref> With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 11.</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F3H-G mockup in 1954.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell F3H-G/H mockup, 1954]]\nIn 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its [[McDonnell F3H Demon|F3H Demon]] naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name=\"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''. Boeing. Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and \u22122A engines, each having 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete [[launch and recovery cycle|launch-recovery cycle]] performed on 15 February 1960 from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\nThere were proposals to name the F4H \"[[Satan]]\" and \"[[Mithras]]\".<ref name=\"Donald 2002\">Donald and Lake 2002, pp. 6, 8.</ref> In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name \"Phantom II\", the first \"Phantom\" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[McDonnell FH Phantom|FH-1 Phantom]]. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and the name \"Spectre\" by the USAF, but neither name was officially used.<ref>Angelucci 1987, p. 316.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:F-4B VF-74 taking off 1961.jpg|thumb|right|VF-74 was the first operational U.S. Navy ''Phantom'' squadron in 1961]]\n\nEarly in production, the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse [[AN/APQ-120|AN/APQ-72]], an [[AN/APG-50]] with a larger radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]].<ref>Lake 1992, p. 21.</ref> During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed.\n\nThe USN operated the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.62&nbsp;kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built; none saw combat, and most ended up as test or training aircraft.<ref name=\"Edenp278\">Eden 2004, p. 278.</ref> The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a [[Texas Instruments]] AAA-4 [[Infra-red search and track]] pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900&nbsp;lbf (48.5&nbsp;kN) dry and 16,950&nbsp;lbf (75.4&nbsp;kN) [[afterburner]] (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and [[VF-121]] Pacemakers receiving the first examples at [[NAS Miramar]].<ref name=\"Edenp278\"/>\n\nThe USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]]'s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the US military. After an F-4B won the \"Operation Highspeed\" fly-off against the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A \"Spectre\" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the US Navy's focus on air-to-air interception in the Fleet Air Defense (FAD) mission, the USAF emphasized both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground fighter-bomber role. With McNamara's unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C. The first Air Force Phantom flew on 27 May 1963, exceeding Mach&nbsp;2 on its maiden flight.<ref name=\"knaackp266\">Knaack 1978, p. 266.</ref>\n\nThe F-4J improved both air-to-air and ground-attack capability; deliveries begun in 1966 and ended in 1972 with 522 built.<ref name=\"Gunstonp246\">Gunston 1979, p.246.</ref> It was equipped with J79-GE-10 engines with 17,844&nbsp;lbf (79.374&nbsp;kN) thrust, the Westinghouse [[AN/AWG-10]] Fire Control System (making the F-4J the first fighter in the world with operational [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20020229000|title=AWG-10 Radar, Antenna Control, Type C-8778/APG-59|access-date=10 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170457/http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20020229000|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> a new integrated missile control system and the AN/AJB-7 bombing system for expanded ground attack capability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f4_21.html|title=McDonnell F-4J Phantom II|access-date=10 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130547/http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f4_21.html|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe F-4N (updated F-4Bs) with smokeless engines and F-4J aerodynamic improvements started in 1972 under a U.S. Navy-initiated refurbishment program called \"Project Bee Line\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/f4/d4c-118173-5.htm|title=Project Bee Line |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503045045/http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/f4/d4c-118173-5.htm|archivedate=3 May 2012}}</ref> with 228 converted by 1978.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to [[drag (physics)|drag]], combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]], yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.<ref name=\"Higham 1978\">Higham and Williams 1978.</ref>\n\n===Costs===\n<!-- Approximately a five-fold increase from 1965 to 2005 -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!||F-4C||RF-4C||F-4D||F-4E\n|-\n|Unit [[Research and development|R&D]] cost|| \u2013 || 61,200 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|61200|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || \u2013 || 22,700 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|22700|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Airframe|| 1,388,725 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1388725|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,679,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1679000|1965}}}} (Current) || 1,018,682 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1018682|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,662,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1662000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Engines|| 317,647 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|317647|1965}}}} (Current) || 276,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|276000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 260,563 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260563|1965}}}} (Current) || 393,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|393000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Electronics|| 52,287 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|52287|1965}}}} (Current)|| 293,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|293000|1965}}}} (Current) || 262,101 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|262101|1965}}}} (Current) || 299,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|299000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Armament|| 139,706 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|139706|1965}}}} (Current)|| 73,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|73000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 133,430 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|133430|1965}}}} (Current) || 111,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|111000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Ordnance|| \u2013 || \u2013 || 6,817 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6817|1965}}}} (Current)|| 8,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Flyaway cost|| 1.9&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.9|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 2.3&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.3|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 1.7&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.7|1965|r=1}} million (Current) || 2.4&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.4|1965|r=1}} million (Current)\n|-\n|Modification costs|| 116,289 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|116289|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973|| 55,217 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55217|1965}}}} (2008) by 1973 || 233,458 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|233458|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || 7,995 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7995|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Cost per flying hour|| 924 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|924|1965}}}} (2008)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|867|1965}}}} (Current)|| 896 (1965)<br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Maintenance cost per flying hour || colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 545 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|545|1965}}}} (Current)\n|}\nNote: Original amounts were in 1965 U.S. dollars.<ref name=\"knaack\">Knaack 1978</ref> The figures in these tables have been adjusted for inflation to the current year.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{See also|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II U.S. operators}}\n\n===United States Air Force===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n|+ USAF F-4 Summary for Vietnam War action\n|-\n!

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the \"Rivet Haste\" program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 \"Dogfight Sparrow\" had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots.

The superiority of the Phantom over the [[English Electric Lightning]] in terms of both range and weapon load, combined with the successful introduction of the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], meant that, during the mid-1970s, most of the ground attack Phantoms in Germany were redeployed to the UK to replace air defence Lightning squadrons.<ref name=\"Thunder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/history.php|title=History|work=McDonnell-Douglas/BAC F-4K/M Phantom II|publisher=Thunder and Lightnings|accessdate=2 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601124109/http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/history.php|archive-date=1 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A second RAF squadron, [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|111 Squadron]], was formed on the FG.1 in 1979 after the disbandment of [[892 Naval Air Squadron|892 NAS]].\n\nIn 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], three Phantom FGR2s of [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|No. 29 Squadron]] were on active Quick Reaction Alert duty on [[RAF Ascension Island|Ascension Island]] to protect the base from air attack.<ref name=\"barg\">Burden et al. 1986, pp. 417\u2013419.</ref> After the [[Falklands War]], 15 upgraded ex-USN F-4Js, known as the F-4J(UK) entered RAF service to compensate for one interceptor squadron redeployed to the Falklands.<ref name=\"Green 2001\"/>\n\nAround 15 RAF squadrons received various marks of Phantom, many of them based in Germany.

The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate, and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether it could be used as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.<ref>[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/graphics/F-4/index.html \"NASA Dryden F-4 Graphics Collection.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101163946/http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Graphics/F-4/index.html |date=1 November 2009}} ''NASA''.
