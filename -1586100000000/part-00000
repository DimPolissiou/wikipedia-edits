Historically in the [[Amounderness]] [[hundred (division)|Hundred]], it is situated on the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] between [[Lancaster, England|Lancaster]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], a short distance from the town of [[Garstang]], and [[Myerscough College]]. The [[River Wyre|Wyre]], [[River Calder, Wyre|Calder]] and [[River Brock]], run through the parish and in places form the parish boundary.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nCatterall is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Catrehala'' Later references include Catrehal, 1272; Katerhalle, 1277; Caterhale, Caterale, 1292.\n\nThe etymology of the name suggests that the 'hala'or 'halh' part may refer to a topographical feature, indicating that the land mass forming the parish was, in times of antiquity, a 'promontory into the marsh'. This has a certain appeal, as the western edge of the parish does indeed border the flatlands of [[The Fylde]]. The same source also suggests that the first section of the name may be associated with a cat. However, this is an educated guess, as no other evidence has been uncovered to support the theory, other than the observation that the old parish boundary had the appearance of a (cats?) tongue.\n\n== History ==\n\nOn 14 February 1716, three local men (Joseph Wadsworth and Thomas Goose of Catterall and Thomas Cartmell of [[Claughton-on-Brock|Claughton]]) were executed for joining the [[The Fifteen|Jacobite rebellion of 1715]]. They were reputedly executed at Stocks Lane End. In modern times, this is where Cock Robin Lane and Catterall Lane join the A6.\n\nThe parish is traversed by several important routes, including the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]], the [[M6 Motorway]], the [[West Coast Main Line]], the B6430 and the [[Lancaster Canal]], all of which run, more-or-less north to south. The parish was served by [[Garstang and Catterall railway station]], which used to stand on the West Coast Main Line, but was closed in the 1960s and later demolished.\n\nIn May 2007, Gennaro Panzuto, a member of the [[Camorra]], was arrested in Catterall in connection with gang-related murders.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1551938/Second-Mafia-mobster-found-in-north-England.html |title='Second Mafia mobster found in north England' |first=Nigel |last=Bunyan |date=18 May 2007 |access-date=10 October 2018 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe 2011 census showed that 2,280 people lived in the parish of Catterall, of whom 1,124 were male and 1,126 were female.<ref>{{NOMIS2011|id=E04005324|title=Catterall Parish|accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe main employer in Catterall is Franklaw Water Treatment Works on Catterall Lane. The site has developed since the 1960s from a couple of '[[Dalek]]' style boreholes, to a large water treatment works, operated by [[United Utilities]].\n\nThe other main employer is Collinson Plc, who manufacture agricultural and industrial buildings.\n\nThe adjoining parishes are [[Claughton, Wyre|Claughton]], [[Kirkland, Lancashire|Kirkland]], [[Barnacre-with-Bonds]], [[Upper Rawcliffe-with-Tarnacre]] and [[Myerscough and Bilsborrow]].\n\n==Governance==\nAn [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] in the same name exists.
