The highway crosses the state border from [[New Lebanon, New York]], into [[Hancock, Massachusetts]], and runs eastward into [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], where it ends at [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Kenmore Square]]. It spends the vast majority of its journey paralleling the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], which has largely superseded US-20 for through travel. Still, US-20 directly serves many towns and local business areas which the Turnpike bypasses.<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\">[http://homepage.mac.com/kefkafloyd/valleyroads/us20.html Roads and Highways of the Pioneer Valley - US 20]</ref>\n\nU.S. Route 20 is the longest numbered highway in the entire country and also holds the distinction of being the longest numbered highway in the state, edging out [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]] by merely a mile (Route 28 is {{convert|151.92|mi|km}} long).<ref name=inventory/>\n\nParts of US 20 between the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and Boston areas were also an alignment of the [[Boston Post Road]], an early colonial highway designated in 1673 for carrying mail between [[New York City]] and Boston.<ref>S.H.

The highway enters town and meets [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. In Lenox, [[Massachusetts Route 7A|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast. The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]]. Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket. Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].\n\nUS-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]]. US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 23|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]]. US-20 crosses the [[U.S. Route 202]]/[[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 187|Route 187]] just to the east. US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by Route 20A, to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20. Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''. US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5,<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\"/> where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road. US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 21|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]]. In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Massachusetts Route 32|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8. US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east. Before leaving Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 19|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.\n\n===Worcester and Middlesex counties===\nUS-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 148|Route 148]]. The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 131|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3. I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Massachusetts Route 49|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 169|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 31|Route 31]]. Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]]. Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange. US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] after briefly crossing into [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Massachusetts Route 122A|Route 122A]]). The route re-enters Worcester, crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11. Leaving Worcester, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] south of town. The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9. Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] in the town center. Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north. US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].\n\nUS-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs. The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]] in the process. It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]/[[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].  The entire length of US-20 in Weston is designated as the [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Weston, Massachusetts)|Boston Post Road Historic District]], since it retains much of its rural 18th-century character. Immediately upon crossing into Waltham, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston and having access to the Mass Pike. US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117. US-20 also meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 60|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham. The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to Watertown Square, where it has a major junction with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. US-20 becomes North Beacon Street at this point and continues southeast as it crosses into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[North Beacon Street Bridge]].\n\n===Suffolk County===\n[[File:US20end.jpg|thumb|left|250px|US&nbsp;20 eastbound approaching Kenmore Square, Boston]]\n[[File:Rt 20 sign.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern terminus sign of U.S. Route 20 in Boston, MA]]\n\nUS-20 briefly continues as Leo F. Birmingham Parkway upon crossing into the Boston neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] Extension, before it turns right and continues as North Beacon Street again, and crosses under the Mass Pike (no interchange). US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston. Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance. US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection. At this point, the [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]/[[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] border lies just feet south of the road, and US-20 passes through [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/maps/|title=Boston University maps, retrieved August 5, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>  US-20 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at the southern end of the [[Boston University Bridge]], crossing over the Mass Pike for the final time. Route 2, via Mountfort Street, Park Drive, and Beacon Street, turns from south to east to meet US-20 at [[Kenmore Square]]. Upon meeting Route 2 again, US-20 meets its eastern terminus, with Route 2 taking Commonwealth Ave its final stretch to the [[Boston Public Garden]] and [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]], where Route 2 meets its own end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Boston&state=MA&address=Kenmore+Square|title=MapQuest Maps:|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Route 20's official eastern terminus is in [[Kenmore Square]] at the intersection of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], [[Beacon Street]], and [[Brookline Avenue]].\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\">{{cite web|url=http://services.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/RouteSelection.htm|title=Massachusetts Route Log Application|author=MassDOT Planning Division|date=|website=|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>|location_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" />}}\n{{MAint|exit\n|county=Berkshire\n|cspan=12\n|location=Hancock\n|mile=0.000\n|espan=20\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|20|dir1=west}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Pittsfield\n|lspan=3\n|mile=3.336\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|41|dir1=south|city1=Richmond|city2=West Stockbridge}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;41\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=7.431\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|9|dir1=east|name1=Center Street|city1=Dalton}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route&nbsp;9}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=7.596\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=north|city1=Williamstown}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;7 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Lenox\n|lspan=3\n|mile=12.845\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|7A|dir1=south|city1=Lenox}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;7A\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=14.694\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|183|dir1=south|city1=Lenox|city2=Tanglewood}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;183\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=15.001\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=south|city1=Stockbridge|city2=Great Barrington}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;7 concurrency\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit\n|state=MA\n|location=Lee\n|lspan=3\n|mile=17.405\n|bridge=Bridge over the [[Housatonic River]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=toll\n|mile=18.766\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|90|MATP|city1=Springfield|city2=Boston|location3=[[Albany, New York|Albany, NY]]|location4=[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]]}}\n|notes=Exit 2 on I-90 / Mass Pike\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=18.836\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|102|dir1=west|city1=Stockbridge|city2=Great Barrington}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;102\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Becket\n|lspan=2\n|type=concur\n|mile=25.719\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=south|city1=Otis|location2=[[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted, CT]]}}\n|notes=Western end of Route&nbsp;8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=30.895\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=north|city1=Becket|city2=Dalton}}\n|notes=Eastern end of Route&nbsp;8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Hampshire\n|location=Huntington\n|mile=41.831\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|112|dir1=north|to2=to|MA|66|city1=Huntington}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route&nbsp;112\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Hampden\n|cspan=18\n|location=Russell\n|mile=48.016\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|23|dir1=west|city1=Blandford|city2=Otis}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;23\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Westfield\n|lspan=3\n|type=concur\n|mile=53.752\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|202|MA|10|dir2=north|city1=Holyoke|city2=Athol}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;202 / Route&nbsp;10 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=54.004\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|202|MA|10|dir2=south|city1=Southwick|location2=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]]}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;202 / Route&nbsp;10 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=55.770\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|187|dir1=south|city1=Feeding Hills}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;187\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=West Springfield\n|mile=61.577\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|5|city1=Agawam|city2=Northampton}}\n|notes=Rotary interchange\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Connecticut River]]\n|mile=61.697\n|bridge=Bridge\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Springfield\n|lspan=7\n|mile=62.739\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|MA|20A|dir2=east|location1=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford, CT]]|city2=Greenfield}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 20A;

The highway enters town and meets [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. In Lenox, [[Massachusetts Route 7A|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast. The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]]. Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket. Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].\n\nUS-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]]. US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 23|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]]. US-20 crosses the [[U.S. Route 202]]/[[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 187|Route 187]] just to the east. US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by Route 20A, to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20. Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''. US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5,<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\"/> where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road. US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 21|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]]. In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Massachusetts Route 32|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8. US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east. Before leaving Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 19|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.\n\n===Worcester and Middlesex counties===\nUS-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 148|Route 148]]. The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 131|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3. I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Massachusetts Route 49|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 169|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 31|Route 31]]. Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]]. Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange. US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] after briefly crossing into [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Massachusetts Route 122A|Route 122A]]). The route re-enters Worcester, crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11. Leaving Worcester, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] south of town. The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9. Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] in the town center. Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north. US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].\n\nUS-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs. The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]] in the process. It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]/[[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].  The entire length of US-20 in Weston is designated as the [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Weston, Massachusetts)|Boston Post Road Historic District]], since it retains much of its rural 18th-century character. Immediately upon crossing into Waltham, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston and having access to the Mass Pike. US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117. US-20 also meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 60|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham. The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to Watertown Square, where it has a major junction with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. US-20 becomes North Beacon Street at this point and continues southeast as it crosses into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[North Beacon Street Bridge]].\n\n===Suffolk County===\n[[File:US20end.jpg|thumb|left|250px|US&nbsp;20 eastbound approaching Kenmore Square, Boston]]\n[[File:Rt 20 sign.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern terminus sign of U.S. Route 20 in Boston, MA]]\n\nUS-20 briefly continues as Leo F. Birmingham Parkway upon crossing into the Boston neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] Extension, before it turns right and continues as North Beacon Street again, and crosses under the Mass Pike (no interchange). US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston. Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance. US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection.
