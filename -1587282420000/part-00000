It is characterized by a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, [[leukocytes]], such as [[monocytes]] or [[basophils]], begin to attack the [[endothelium]] of the artery lumen in [[cardiac muscle]]. The ensuing [[inflammation]] leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial [[tunica intima]], a region of the vessel wall located between the [[endothelium]] and the [[tunica media]]. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, [[collagen]], and [[elastin]]. At first, as the plaques grow, only [[intima-media thickness|wall thickening]] occurs without any narrowing. [[Stenosis]] is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.\n\n=== Cellular ===\n[[File:RCA atherosclerosis.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of an [[right coronary artery|artery]] that supplies the [[heart]] showing significant atherosclerosis and marked [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] narrowing. Tissue has been stained using [[Masson's trichrome]].]]\nEarly atherogenesis is characterized by the adherence of blood circulating [[monocytes]] (a type of [[white blood cell]]) to the vascular bed lining, the [[endothelium]], then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and further activation into monocyte-derived [[macrophage]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz CJ, Valente AJ, Sprague EA, Kelley JL, Cayatte AJ, Mowery J | title = Atherosclerosis.

[[Fatty streak]]s may appear and disappear.\n\n[[Low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles in blood plasma invade the [[endothelium]] and become oxidized, creating risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as [[Lp-LpA2]]) and [[free radical]]s in the endothelium.\n\nInitial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the artery wall from the bloodstream, with [[platelet]]s adhering to the area of insult. This may be promoted by [[redox signaling]] induction of factors such as [[VCAM-1]], which recruit circulating monocytes, and [[M-CSF]], which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into [[macrophage]]s, which proliferate locally,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robbins CS, Hilgendorf I, Weber GF, Theurl I, Iwamoto Y, Figueiredo JL, Gorbatov R, Sukhova GK, Gerhardt LM, Smyth D, Zavitz CC, Shikatani EA, Parsons M, van Rooijen N, Lin HY, Husain M, Libby P, Nahrendorf M, Weissleder R, Swirski FK | title = Local proliferation dominates lesional macrophage accumulation in atherosclerosis | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 1166\u201372 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23933982 | pmc = 3769444 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3258 }}</ref> ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large \"[[foam cells]]\" \u2013 so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and resulting high [[lipid]] content.

This causes the formation of a fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak.

With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes.  A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action ([[Rainer Liedtke]] 2008).\n\nCholesterol is delivered into the vessel wall by cholesterol-containing [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles. To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL particles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if there is insufficient [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL), the lipoprotein particle that removes cholesterol from tissues and carries it back to the liver.\n\nThe foam cells and platelets encourage the migration and proliferation of [[smooth muscle]] cells, which in turn ingest lipids, become replaced by collagen and transform into foam cells themselves. A protective fibrous cap normally forms between the fatty deposits and the artery lining (the [[endothelium|intima]]).\n\nThese capped fatty deposits (now called 'atheromas') produce enzymes that cause the artery to enlarge over time. As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing (\"[[stenosis]]\") of the opening (\"lumen\") occurs. The artery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening.

The core consists of lipid-laden cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) with elevated tissue cholesterol and cholesterol ester content, fibrin, proteoglycans, collagen, elastin, and cellular debris.  In advanced plaques, the central core of the plaque usually contains extracellular cholesterol deposits (released from dead cells), which form areas of cholesterol crystals with empty, needle-like clefts. At the periphery of the plaque are younger \"foamy\" cells and capillaries. These plaques usually produce the most damage to the individual when they rupture.

These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.\n\n===Rupture and stenosis===\n[[File:Late complications of atherosclerosis.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|Progression of atherosclerosis to late complications.]]\nAlthough the disease process tends to be slowly progressive over decades, it usually remains asymptomatic until an atheroma [[wikt:ulcer|ulcerates]], which leads to immediate blood clotting at the site of atheroma ulcer.  This triggers a cascade of events that leads to clot enlargement, which may quickly obstruct the flow of blood. A complete blockage leads to ischemia of the myocardial (heart) muscle and damage.  This process is the [[myocardial infarction]] or \"heart attack\".\n\nIf the heart attack is not fatal, fibrous organization of the clot within the lumen ensues, covering the rupture but also producing [[stenosis]] or closure of the lumen, or over time and after repeated ruptures, resulting in a persistent, usually localized stenosis or blockage of the artery lumen. Stenoses can be slowly progressive, whereas plaque ulceration is a sudden event that occurs specifically in atheromas with thinner/weaker fibrous caps that have become \"unstable\".\n\nRepeated plaque ruptures, ones not resulting in total lumen closure, combined with the clot patch over the rupture and healing response to stabilize the clot is the process that produces most stenoses over time. The stenotic areas tend to become more stable despite increased flow velocities at these narrowings. Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, prior to their rupture, produced very little if any stenosis.\n\nFrom clinical trials, 20% is the average stenosis at plaques that subsequently rupture with resulting complete artery closure. Most severe clinical events do not occur at plaques that produce high-grade stenosis. From clinical trials, only 14% of heart attacks occur from artery closure at plaques producing a 75% or greater stenosis prior to the vessel closing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIf the fibrous cap separating a soft atheroma from the bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing [[collagen]] and [[tissue factor]]; they activate [[platelet]]s and activate the [[coagulation|system of coagulation]]. The result is the formation of a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of [[oxygen]] and nutrients.

Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local endothelium. This is the manifestation of a misrepair. Important is this altered remodeling makes the local endothelium have increased fragility to damage and have reduced repair-efficiency. As a consequence, this part of endothelium has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating. Within a part of arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.\n\n===Components===\nThe plaque is divided into three distinct components:\n# The [[atheroma]] (\"lump of gruel\", {{ety|gre|''\u1f00\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1'' (athera)|[[gruel]]}}), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the artery\n# Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals\n# Calcification at the outer base of older or more advanced [[lesions]].

Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing [[thromboembolism]].\n\nApart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen [[stenosis]] is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in [[ischemia]]. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see [[vulnerable plaque]]), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This event is called an [[infarction]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Calcificatio atherosclerotica.jpg|thumb|Microphotography of arterial wall with calcified (violet color) atherosclerotic plaque ([[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] stain)]]\nAreas of severe narrowing, [[stenosis]], detectable by [[angiography]], and to a lesser extent \"[[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]]\" have long been the focus of human diagnostic techniques for [[cardiovascular disease]], in general. However, these methods focus on detecting only severe narrowing, not the underlying atherosclerosis disease.  As demonstrated by human clinical studies, most severe events occur in locations with heavy plaque, yet little or no lumen narrowing present before debilitating events suddenly occur. Plaque rupture can lead to artery lumen occlusion within seconds to minutes, and potential permanent debility and sometimes sudden death.\n\nPlaques that have ruptured are called complicated plaques.  The [[extracellular matrix]] of the lesion breaks, usually at the shoulder of the fibrous cap that separates the lesion from the arterial lumen, where the exposed thrombogenic components of the plaque, mainly [[collagen]] will trigger [[thrombus]] formation.  The thrombus then travels downstream to other blood vessels, where the blood clot may partially or completely block blood flow. If the blood flow is completely blocked, cell deaths occur due to the lack of [[oxygen]] supply to nearby cells, resulting in [[necrosis]]. The narrowing or obstruction of blood flow can occur in any artery within the body. Obstruction of arteries supplying the heart muscle results in a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], while the obstruction of arteries supplying the brain results in an ischaemic [[stroke]].\n\n[[File:RICA Stenosis 174302500.jpg|thumb|300px|Doppler ultrasound of right internal Carotid artery with calcified and non-calcified plaques showing less than 70% stenosis]]\nLumen stenosis that is greater than 75% was considered the hallmark of clinically significant disease in the past because recurring episodes of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and abnormalities in [[Cardiac stress test|stress tests]] are only detectable at that particular severity of stenosis.\nHowever, clinical trials have shown that only about 14% of clinically debilitating events occur at sites with more than 75% stenosis. The majority of cardiovascular events that involve sudden rupture of the atheroma plaque do not display any evident narrowing of the lumen.\nThus, greater attention has been focused on \"vulnerable plaque\" from the late 1990s onwards.<ref name=MaseriFuster>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maseri A, Fuster V | title = Is there a vulnerable plaque? | journal = Circulation | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 2068\u201371 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12719286 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000070585.48035.D1 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nBesides the traditional diagnostic methods such as angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of atherosclerotic disease. Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and physiologic measurement.\n\nExamples of anatomical detection methods include coronary calcium scoring by CT, carotid IMT ([[Intima-media thickness|intimal media thickness]]) measurement by ultrasound, and [[intravascular ultrasound]] (IVUS).  Examples of physiologic measurement methods include lipoprotein subclass analysis, [[Glycosylated hemoglobin|HbA1c]], [[C-reactive protein|hs-CRP]], and [[homocysteine]].\nBoth anatomic and physiologic methods allow early detection before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods are more expensive and some of them are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n==Prevention==\nUp to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.<ref name=\"McGillMcMahan2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McGill HC, McMahan CA, Gidding SS | title = Preventing heart disease in the 21st century: implications of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study | journal = Circulation | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1216\u201327 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316498 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.717033 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeal CJ, Dajani T, Wilson D, Cassidy-Bushrow AE, Dickerson JB, Ory M | title = Hypercholesterolemia in youth: opportunities and obstacles to prevent premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20\u20138 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20425267 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-009-0072-0 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80a51fe741fda663dfdd983cb57165fabfd3a775 }}</ref> Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors\u2013for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions.

It is characterized by a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, [[leukocytes]], such as [[monocytes]] or [[basophils]], begin to attack the [[endothelium]] of the artery lumen in [[cardiac muscle]]. The ensuing [[inflammation]] leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial [[tunica intima]], a region of the vessel wall located between the [[endothelium]] and the [[tunica media]]. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, [[collagen]], and [[elastin]]. At first, as the plaques grow, only [[intima-media thickness|wall thickening]] occurs without any narrowing. [[Stenosis]] is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.\n\n=== Cellular ===\n[[File:RCA atherosclerosis.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of an [[right coronary artery|artery]] that supplies the [[heart]] showing significant atherosclerosis and marked [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] narrowing.

[[Fatty streak]]s may appear and disappear.\n\n[[Low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles in blood plasma invade the [[endothelium]] and become oxidized, creating risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as [[Lp-LpA2]]) and [[free radical]]s in the endothelium.\n\nInitial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the artery wall from the bloodstream, with [[platelet]]s adhering to the area of insult. This may be promoted by [[redox signaling]] induction of factors such as [[VCAM-1]], which recruit circulating monocytes, and [[M-CSF]], which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into [[macrophage]]s, which proliferate locally,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robbins CS, Hilgendorf I, Weber GF, Theurl I, Iwamoto Y, Figueiredo JL, Gorbatov R, Sukhova GK, Gerhardt LM, Smyth D, Zavitz CC, Shikatani EA, Parsons M, van Rooijen N, Lin HY, Husain M, Libby P, Nahrendorf M, Weissleder R, Swirski FK | title = Local proliferation dominates lesional macrophage accumulation in atherosclerosis | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 1166\u201372 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23933982 | pmc = 3769444 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3258 }}</ref> ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large \"[[foam cells]]\" \u2013 so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and resulting high [[lipid]] content.

With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes.  A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action ([[Rainer Liedtke]] 2008).\n\nCholesterol is delivered into the vessel wall by cholesterol-containing [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles. To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL particles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if there is insufficient [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL), the lipoprotein particle that removes cholesterol from tissues and carries it back to the liver.\n\nThe foam cells and platelets encourage the migration and proliferation of [[smooth muscle]] cells, which in turn ingest lipids, become replaced by collagen and transform into foam cells themselves. A protective fibrous cap normally forms between the fatty deposits and the artery lining (the [[endothelium|intima]]).\n\nThese capped fatty deposits (now called 'atheromas') produce enzymes that cause the artery to enlarge over time. As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing (\"[[stenosis]]\") of the opening (\"lumen\") occurs. The artery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening.

Beneath the endothelium there is a \"fibrous cap\" covering the atheromatous \"core\" of the plaque. The core consists of lipid-laden cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) with elevated tissue cholesterol and cholesterol ester content, fibrin, proteoglycans, collagen, elastin, and cellular debris.  In advanced plaques, the central core of the plaque usually contains extracellular cholesterol deposits (released from dead cells), which form areas of cholesterol crystals with empty, needle-like clefts. At the periphery of the plaque are younger \"foamy\" cells and capillaries. These plaques usually produce the most damage to the individual when they rupture. Cholesterol crystals may also play a role.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Janoudi A, Shamoun FE, Kalavakunta JK, Abela GS | title = Cholesterol crystal induced arterial inflammation and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 37 | issue = 25 | pages = 1959\u201367 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26705388 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehv653 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n# The fibrous plaque is also localized under the intima, within the wall of the artery resulting in thickening and expansion of the wall and, sometimes, spotty localized narrowing of the lumen with some atrophy of the muscular layer. The fibrous plaque contains collagen fibers (eosinophilic), precipitates of calcium (hematoxylinophilic) and, rarely, lipid-laden cells.\n\nIn effect, the muscular portion of the artery wall forms small [[aneurysm]]s just large enough to hold the [[atheroma]] that are present. The muscular portion of artery walls usually remain strong, even after they have remodeled to compensate for the atheromatous plaques.\n\nHowever, atheromas within the vessel wall are soft and fragile with little elasticity. Arteries constantly expand and contract with each heartbeat, i.e., the pulse. In addition, the calcification deposits between the outer portion of the atheroma and the muscular wall, as they progress, lead to a loss of elasticity and stiffening of the artery as a whole.\n\nThe calcification deposits,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | first2 = Roshan L.

On CT, >130 units on the [[Hounsfield scale]] (some argue for 90 units) has been the radiographic density usually accepted as clearly representing tissue calcification within arteries. These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.\n\n===Rupture and stenosis===\n[[File:Late complications of atherosclerosis.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|Progression of atherosclerosis to late complications.]]\nAlthough the disease process tends to be slowly progressive over decades, it usually remains asymptomatic until an atheroma [[wikt:ulcer|ulcerates]], which leads to immediate blood clotting at the site of atheroma ulcer.  This triggers a cascade of events that leads to clot enlargement, which may quickly obstruct the flow of blood. A complete blockage leads to ischemia of the myocardial (heart) muscle and damage.  This process is the [[myocardial infarction]] or \"heart attack\".\n\nIf the heart attack is not fatal, fibrous organization of the clot within the lumen ensues, covering the rupture but also producing [[stenosis]] or closure of the lumen, or over time and after repeated ruptures, resulting in a persistent, usually localized stenosis or blockage of the artery lumen. Stenoses can be slowly progressive, whereas plaque ulceration is a sudden event that occurs specifically in atheromas with thinner/weaker fibrous caps that have become \"unstable\".\n\nRepeated plaque ruptures, ones not resulting in total lumen closure, combined with the clot patch over the rupture and healing response to stabilize the clot is the process that produces most stenoses over time. The stenotic areas tend to become more stable despite increased flow velocities at these narrowings. Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, prior to their rupture, produced very little if any stenosis.\n\nFrom clinical trials, 20% is the average stenosis at plaques that subsequently rupture with resulting complete artery closure. Most severe clinical events do not occur at plaques that produce high-grade stenosis. From clinical trials, only 14% of heart attacks occur from artery closure at plaques producing a 75% or greater stenosis prior to the vessel closing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIf the fibrous cap separating a soft atheroma from the bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing [[collagen]] and [[tissue factor]]; they activate [[platelet]]s and activate the [[coagulation|system of coagulation]]. The result is the formation of a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of [[oxygen]] and nutrients. If this is the [[myocardium]] (heart muscle) [[Angina pectoris|angina]] (cardiac chest pain) or [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) develops.\n\n===Accelerated growth of plaques===\nThe distribution of atherosclerotic plaques in a part of arterial endothelium is inhomogeneous.

Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local endothelium. This is the manifestation of a misrepair. Important is this altered remodeling makes the local endothelium have increased fragility to damage and have reduced repair-efficiency. As a consequence, this part of endothelium has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating. Within a part of arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.\n\n===Components===\nThe plaque is divided into three distinct components:\n# The [[atheroma]] (\"lump of gruel\", {{ety|gre|''\u1f00\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1'' (athera)|[[gruel]]}}), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the artery\n# Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals\n# Calcification at the outer base of older or more advanced [[lesions]]. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross R | title = Atherosclerosis--an inflammatory disease | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 340 | issue = 2 | pages = 115\u201326 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9887164 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199901143400207 }}</ref> The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in [[extracellular matrix]] and [[smooth muscle cells]].

Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing [[thromboembolism]].\n\nApart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen [[stenosis]] is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in [[ischemia]]. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see [[vulnerable plaque]]), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This event is called an [[infarction]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Calcificatio atherosclerotica.jpg|thumb|Microphotography of arterial wall with calcified (violet color) atherosclerotic plaque ([[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] stain)]]\nAreas of severe narrowing, [[stenosis]], detectable by [[angiography]], and to a lesser extent \"[[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]]\" have long been the focus of human diagnostic techniques for [[cardiovascular disease]], in general. However, these methods focus on detecting only severe narrowing, not the underlying atherosclerosis disease.  As demonstrated by human clinical studies, most severe events occur in locations with heavy plaque, yet little or no lumen narrowing present before debilitating events suddenly occur. Plaque rupture can lead to artery lumen occlusion within seconds to minutes, and potential permanent debility and sometimes sudden death.\n\nPlaques that have ruptured are called complicated plaques.  The [[extracellular matrix]] of the lesion breaks, usually at the shoulder of the fibrous cap that separates the lesion from the arterial lumen, where the exposed thrombogenic components of the plaque, mainly [[collagen]] will trigger [[thrombus]] formation.  The thrombus then travels downstream to other blood vessels, where the blood clot may partially or completely block blood flow. If the blood flow is completely blocked, cell deaths occur due to the lack of [[oxygen]] supply to nearby cells, resulting in [[necrosis]]. The narrowing or obstruction of blood flow can occur in any artery within the body. Obstruction of arteries supplying the heart muscle results in a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], while the obstruction of arteries supplying the brain results in an ischaemic [[stroke]].\n\n[[File:RICA Stenosis 174302500.jpg|thumb|300px|Doppler ultrasound of right internal Carotid artery with calcified and non-calcified plaques showing less than 70% stenosis]]\nLumen stenosis that is greater than 75% was considered the hallmark of clinically significant disease in the past because recurring episodes of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and abnormalities in [[Cardiac stress test|stress tests]] are only detectable at that particular severity of stenosis.\nHowever, clinical trials have shown that only about 14% of clinically debilitating events occur at sites with more than 75% stenosis. The majority of cardiovascular events that involve sudden rupture of the atheroma plaque do not display any evident narrowing of the lumen.\nThus, greater attention has been focused on \"vulnerable plaque\" from the late 1990s onwards.<ref name=MaseriFuster>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maseri A, Fuster V | title = Is there a vulnerable plaque? | journal = Circulation | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 2068\u201371 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12719286 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000070585.48035.D1 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nBesides the traditional diagnostic methods such as angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of atherosclerotic disease. Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and physiologic measurement.\n\nExamples of anatomical detection methods include coronary calcium scoring by CT, carotid IMT ([[Intima-media thickness|intimal media thickness]]) measurement by ultrasound, and [[intravascular ultrasound]] (IVUS).  Examples of physiologic measurement methods include lipoprotein subclass analysis, [[Glycosylated hemoglobin|HbA1c]], [[C-reactive protein|hs-CRP]], and [[homocysteine]].\nBoth anatomic and physiologic methods allow early detection before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods are more expensive and some of them are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n==Prevention==\nUp to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.<ref name=\"McGillMcMahan2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McGill HC, McMahan CA, Gidding SS | title = Preventing heart disease in the 21st century: implications of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study | journal = Circulation | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1216\u201327 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316498 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.717033 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeal CJ, Dajani T, Wilson D, Cassidy-Bushrow AE, Dickerson JB, Ory M | title = Hypercholesterolemia in youth: opportunities and obstacles to prevent premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20\u20138 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20425267 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-009-0072-0 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80a51fe741fda663dfdd983cb57165fabfd3a775 }}</ref> Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors\u2013for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions.

Between 1760s and the 1770s over fourteen of Pott's pamphlets were in circulation.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nPercivall Pott's dedication to his patients and standard of care garnered Pott high praise and fame.

Many diseases today are his namesake including: [[Pott's fracture]], [[Pott disease|Pott's disease]] of the spine, and [[Pott's puffy tumor]]. One disease which does not, yet is important to Pott's legacy is chimney sweeper's carcinoma. Pott quickly recognised the association between carcinoma and [[chimney sweep]]s and published his findings in a piece titled \"Chirurgical Observations relative to\u2026the cancer of the scrotum.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> He wrote that the disease was, \" peculiar to a certain sort of people [ and ] which has not at least to my knowledge, been publicly noticed \u2013 I mean the chimney-sweepers \u2019 cancer. The disease, in these people, seems to derive its origin from a lodgment of soot in the rugae of the scrotum.\"<ref name=\":0\">Pott, Percivall. ''[Chirurgical Observations] : Containing I.

''Chronicle from Aldgate; Life and Death in Shakespeare's London.'' Yale University Press, 1971.{{page needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> These descriptions are ambiguous and it is unclear which anatomical parts considered \"privities\". As such, most historians generally agree that Bassius first correctly described scrotal cancer in 1731.<ref name=\":2\" /> Some historians argue that what Bassius considered scrotal cancer was in fact perineal abscesses to the scrotum as opposed to carcinoma. The minority of historians who agree with this fact, attribute the discovery of scrotal cancer to Treyling in 1740.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |pmid=4922857 |pmc=1069432 |year=1970 |author1=Kipling |first1=M.

Pott was viewed as a mentor and even allowed other physicians and surgeons to live with him while under his guidance.<ref name=\":02\" /> Despite the surgical trends of his time, Pott did not agree with severe treatments and [[heroic medicine]] but rather preferred gentler forms. Percivall Pott's son-in-law, [[James Earle]], described Pott's surgery as being \"divested of great part of its horrors, became, comparatively, a pleasing study.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Soot and occupational cancer ===\n\nIn addition to surgery, Pott's focused on [[public health]] as well drawing his attention to the challenges of chimney-sweeps in his community. He wrote, \"in their early infancy, they are most frequently treated with great brutality, and almost starved with cold and hunger; they are thrust up narrow, and sometimes hot chimneys, where they are bruised, burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to puberty, become peculiarly liable to a most noisome, painful, and fatal disease.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Pott's approach was unique amongst his contemporaries in that he did not simply note an association but approached [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]] from a causal perspective. His work helped later identify soot as the disease-causing agent.<ref name=\":2\" /> Pott did not figure this out on his own, but rather pointed research in the right direction. During Pott's time, there were many discussions pertaining to the cause of scrotal cancer. [[James Earle]] believed that the cancer was caused as a result of the soot entering and residing in the rugae of the scrotum. He famously argued this point based on a trend seen where gardeners who used soot to kill slugs had developed skin carcinoma on their hands. In 1878, George Lawson suggested that the cancer was caused by the friction generated by chimney sweeper's overalls against the scrotum while sifting though soot. This idea was explored by Passey in 1992 who demonstrated that it was the ethereal extract of soot which was capable of inducing sarcoma.<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, Pott also identified that prepubescent boys were most vulnerable to the [[carcinoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10487.x |pmid=21794063 |title=Percivall Pott, the Environment and Cancer |journnfkgn rg fbv bgfg bgbal=BJU International |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=479\u201381 |year=2011 |last1=Herr |first1=Harry W. }}</ref> Pott rose to fame for these connections between occupational hazards and cancer malignancy even though the connection was not fully understood at the time. Pott's \"Chirurgical Observations\" provided a framework to shape the modern understanding of ''[[Occupational cancer]]s.''\n\n== Influence ==\n\nPercivall Pott's work influenced a wave of researcher and change in public policies. After his initial publication, more clinical cases began to emerge rapidly over the following years.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM191011241632103 |title=Cancer of the Scrotum |journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal |volume=163 |issue=21 |pages=792\u20137 |year=1910 |last1=Green |first1=Robert M. }}</ref> This triggered a series of \"[[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788|Chimney Sweepers' Acts]]\" which aimed to protect chimney sweepers. These facilitated the formation of societies like the \"Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys, by Encouraging a New Method of Sweeping Chimneys and for Improving the Condition of Children and Others Employed by Chimney Sweepers\" in 1803 which included the likes of [[Duke]]s, [[Earl]]s, and [[Patronage|Royal Patrons]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite outcry and public demands to change chimney sweeping practices, such as suggesting that young chimney sweeping boys be replaced with mechanical devices, insurance companies, and homeowners argued that Chimney Sweeper's carcinoma was a small price to pay for the protection of the mass population against smoke and chimney fires.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17309190 |year=2006 |author1=Androutsos |first1=G |title=The outstanding British surgeon Percivall Pott (1714\u20131789) and the first description of an occupational cancer |journal=Journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=533\u20139 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Despite the call for action as early as 1788, Pott's work finally began to influence change in 1875, when a decline in scrotal cancer incidence and mortality was noted.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=13396156 |pmc=1037746 |year=1957 |author1=Brown |first1=J.

It is believed that Pott's standard of living was a contributor to the rise of the surgeon within social standings.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nAmid the patient wards, Pott also honed his writing skills and believed in patient education.<ref name=\":2\" /> He would distribute pamphlets, noting his observations and thoughts on topics ranging from \"[[Head injury|head injuries]], [[hydrocele]], [[fistula]], rupture, and fracture\", in the hospital environment.<ref name=\":02\" /> These pamphlets were in high demand and would sell for more than one shilling and six pence. Between 1760s and the 1770s over fourteen of Pott's pamphlets were in circulation.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nPercivall Pott's dedication to his patients and standard of care garnered Pott high praise and fame. He is generally regarded as one of the two greatest surgeons of the 18th century along with his student John Hunter.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 1786, he was honoured as the first Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\":02\" /> Shortly after, he retired in 1787 and was named a governor of [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St. Bartholomew's Hospital]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Chimney sweepers' carcinoma ==\n\nPercivall Pott has influenced medicine and modern understanding of diseases. Many diseases today are his namesake including: [[Pott's fracture]], [[Pott disease|Pott's disease]] of the spine, and [[Pott's puffy tumor]]. One disease which does not, yet is important to Pott's legacy is chimney sweeper's carcinoma. Pott quickly recognised the association between carcinoma and [[chimney sweep]]s and published his findings in a piece titled \"Chirurgical Observations relative to\u2026the cancer of the scrotum.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> He wrote that the disease was, \" peculiar to a certain sort of people [ and ] which has not at least to my knowledge, been publicly noticed \u2013 I mean the chimney-sweepers \u2019 cancer. The disease, in these people, seems to derive its origin from a lodgment of soot in the rugae of the scrotum.\"<ref name=\":0\">Pott, Percivall. ''[Chirurgical Observations] : Containing I.

''Chronicle from Aldgate; Life and Death in Shakespeare's London.'' Yale University Press, 1971.{{page needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> These descriptions are ambiguous and it is unclear which anatomical parts considered \"privities\". As such, most historians generally agree that Bassius first correctly described scrotal cancer in 1731.<ref name=\":2\" /> Some historians argue that what Bassius considered scrotal cancer was in fact perineal abscesses to the scrotum as opposed to carcinoma. The minority of historians who agree with this fact, attribute the discovery of scrotal cancer to Treyling in 1740.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |pmid=4922857 |pmc=1069432 |year=1970 |author1=Kipling |first1=M.

Pott was viewed as a mentor and even allowed other physicians and surgeons to live with him while under his guidance.<ref name=\":02\" /> Despite the surgical trends of his time, Pott did not agree with severe treatments and [[heroic medicine]] but rather preferred gentler forms. Percivall Pott's son-in-law, [[James Earle]], described Pott's surgery as being \"divested of great part of its horrors, became, comparatively, a pleasing study.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Soot and occupational cancer ===\n\nIn addition to surgery, Pott's focused on [[public health]] as well drawing his attention to the challenges of chimney-sweeps in his community. He wrote, \"in their early infancy, they are most frequently treated with great brutality, and almost starved with cold and hunger; they are thrust up narrow, and sometimes hot chimneys, where they are bruised, burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to puberty, become peculiarly liable to a most noisome, painful, and fatal disease.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Pott's approach was unique amongst his contemporaries in that he did not simply note an association but approached [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]] from a causal perspective. His work helped later identify soot as the disease-causing agent.<ref name=\":2\" /> Pott did not figure this out on his own, but rather pointed research in the right direction. During Pott's time, there were many discussions pertaining to the cause of scrotal cancer. [[James Earle]] believed that the cancer was caused as a result of the soot entering and residing in the rugae of the scrotum. He famously argued this point based on a trend seen where gardeners who used soot to kill slugs had developed skin carcinoma on their hands. In 1878, George Lawson suggested that the cancer was caused by the friction generated by chimney sweeper's overalls against the scrotum while sifting though soot. This idea was explored by Passey in 1992 who demonstrated that it was the ethereal extract of soot which was capable of inducing sarcoma.<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, Pott also identified that prepubescent boys were most vulnerable to the [[carcinoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10487.x |pmid=21794063 |title=Percivall Pott, the Environment and Cancer |journal=BJU International |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=479\u201381 |year=2011 |last1=Herr |first1=Harry W. }}</ref> Pott rose to fame for these connections between occupational hazards and cancer malignancy even though the connection was not fully understood at the time. Pott's \"Chirurgical Observations\" provided a framework to shape the modern understanding of ''[[Occupational cancer]]s.''\n\n== Influence ==\n\nPercivall Pott's work influenced a wave of researcher and change in public policies. After his initial publication, more clinical cases began to emerge rapidly over the following years.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM191011241632103 |title=Cancer of the Scrotum |journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal |volume=163 |issue=21 |pages=792\u20137 |year=1910 |last1=Green |first1=Robert M. }}</ref> This triggered a series of \"[[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788|Chimney Sweepers' Acts]]\" which aimed to protect chimney sweepers. These facilitated the formation of societies like the \"Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys, by Encouraging a New Method of Sweeping Chimneys and for Improving the Condition of Children and Others Employed by Chimney Sweepers\" in 1803 which included the likes of [[Duke]]s, [[Earl]]s, and [[Patronage|Royal Patrons]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite outcry and public demands to change chimney sweeping practices, such as suggesting that young chimney sweeping boys be replaced with mechanical devices, insurance companies, and homeowners argued that Chimney Sweeper's carcinoma was a small price to pay for the protection of the mass population against smoke and chimney fires.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17309190 |year=2006 |author1=Androutsos |first1=G |title=The outstanding British surgeon Percivall Pott (1714\u20131789) and the first description of an occupational cancer |journal=Journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=533\u20139 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Despite the call for action as early as 1788, Pott's work finally began to influence change in 1875, when a decline in scrotal cancer incidence and mortality was noted.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=13396156 |pmc=1037746 |year=1957 |author1=Brown |first1=J.
