It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.

Due to their exclusion from the negotiations of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] \u2014 the most important of the peace treaties that brought [[World War I]] to an end \u2014 black ex-servicemen and educated urban classes became disillusioned. Because colonialism had been built on the foundation of capitalism, [[Socialism|socialist]] ideas of equality and global collaboration appealed to these budding revolutionaries.\n\nA letter from [[Jamaica]]n writer and socialist [[Claude McKay]] to [[Leon Trotsky]] in 1922 refers to the experience of black soldiers:\n\n{{cquote|They had been disillusioned with the European war, they kept on having frightful clashes with English and American soldiers, besides the fact the authorities treated them completely differently from the white soldiers...

The presence of 77-year-old [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was historic, as he had organized the First Pan-African Congress in 1919.\n\nAmong the delegates were:\n\n* [[Jomo Kenyatta]], Kenya\n* [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], United States\n\n*[[Hastings Banda]], Malawi\n*[[Kwame Nkrumah]], Ghana\n*[[Dudley Thompson]], Jamaica\n*[[Obafemi Awolowo]] and [[Jaja Wachuku]], Nigeria\n*[[Len Johnson (boxer)|Len Johnson]], Britain\n*[[Peter Abrahams]], South Africa \u00a0\n*[[Amy Ashwood Garvey]], Jamaica\n\nIt also led partially to the creation of the [[Pan-African Federation]], founded in 1946 by Nkrumah and Kenyatta.\n\nThe British Press scarcely mentioned the conference. A number of resolutions were passed, among them the criminalization of [[racial discrimination]] and the main resolution decrying [[imperialism]] and [[capitalism]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Katzenellenbogen|first1=Simon|title=The 1945 Pan-African Congress and its Aftermath at The Manchester Civic Celebration, October 13th to 15th, 1995|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/30/058.html|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=2 May 1995}}</ref>\n\n[[Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre|The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre]] holds a collection of material that relates to the 5th Pan-African Congress.

It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.

Set in [[Hawaii]], the show originally aired for 12 seasons from 1968 to 1980, and continues in [[rerun]]s. At the airing of its last episode, it was the longest-running police drama in American television history.\n\nThe show starred [[Jack Lord]] as Detective Captain [[Steve McGarrett|Stephen \"Steve\" McGarrett]], the head of a special state police task force in Hawaii which was based on an actual unit that existed under martial law after  [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Tomimbang|first=Emme|title=Island Moments|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/ |accessdate=8 September 2012|newspaper=KGMB-TV}}</ref>  The [[theme music]] composed by [[Morton Stevens]] became especially popular.  Many episodes would end with McGarrett instructing his subordinate to \"'''Book 'em, Danno!'''\"<!--Phrase is bolded as it is a [[WP:REDIRECT]]-->, sometimes specifying a charge such as \"[[Murder#Degrees of murder|murder one]]\".\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[CBS]] television network [[CBS Productions|produced]] ''Hawaii Five-O'', which aired from September 20, 1968, to April 5, 1980. The program continues to be broadcast in [[Television syndication|syndication]] worldwide. Created by [[Leonard Freeman]], ''Hawaii Five-O'' was shot on location in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], and throughout the island of [[Oahu]] and other [[Hawaiian islands]] with occasional filming in locales such as [[Los Angeles]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]].\n\nThe show centers on a fictional state police force led by former US naval officer Steve McGarrett (played by [[Jack Lord]]), a detective captain, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], Paul Jameson. In the show, McGarrett oversees state police officers \u2013 the young Danny Williams, veteran Chin Ho Kelly, and streetwise Kono Kalakaua for seasons one through four. [[Honolulu Police Department]] Officer Duke Lukela joined the team as a regular, as did Ben Kokua, who replaced Kono beginning with season five. Occasionally, McGarrett's Five-O team is assisted by other officers as needed: [[Douglas Mossman]] as Det. Frank Kamana, P.O. Sandi Wells ([[Amanda McBroom]]), medical examiner Doc Bergman (Al Eben), forensic specialist Che Fong ([[Harry Endo]]), and a secretary. The first secretary was May, then Jenny, and later Malia, Lani and Luana.<ref name=\"Terrace\">{{Citation | last = Terrace | first = Vincent | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&pg=PA187 | title = Encyclopedia of Television Series, Pilots and Specials | page = 187 | format = Google books | publisher = Verlag f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wirtschaft | year = 1986}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Five-O'' team consists of three to five members (small for a real state police unit), and is portrayed as occupying a suite of offices in the [[\u02bbIolani Palace|Iolani Palace]].<ref name = \"Snauffer\" /> Five-O lacks its own radio network, necessitating frequent requests by McGarrett to the Honolulu Police Department dispatchers.\n\nFor 12 seasons, McGarrett and his team hounded international secret agents, criminals, and [[organized crime]] syndicates plaguing the Hawaiian Islands. With the aid of [[District Attorney]] and later [[Attorney General of Hawaii|Hawaii's Attorney General]] John Manicote, McGarrett is successful in sending most of his enemies to [[prison]]. One such crime syndicate was led by crime family patriarch Honore Vashon, a character introduced in the fifth season. Other criminals and organized crime bosses on the islands were played by actors such as [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Gavin MacLeod]], and [[Ross Martin]] as Tony Alika.\n\nBy the 12th and final season, series regular James MacArthur had left the show (in 1996, he admitted that he had become tired of the role and wanted to do other things), as had Kam Fong. Unlike other characters before him, Fong's character, Chin Ho, at Fong's request, was killed off, murdered while working undercover to expose a protection ring in Chinatown in the last episode of season 10. New characters Jim 'Kimo' Carew ([[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]]), Lori Wilson ([[Sharon Farrell]]), and Truck ([[Moe Keale]]) were introduced in season 12 alongside returning regular character Duke Lukela.<ref name=\"Terrace\" />\n\nMost episodes of ''Hawaii Five-O'' ended with the arrest of criminals and McGarrett snapping, \"Book 'em.\" The offense occasionally was added after this phrase, for example, \"Book 'em, murder one.\" In many episodes, this was directed to Danny Williams and became McGarrett's [[catchphrase]]: \"Book 'em, Danno.\"<ref name=\"Newcomb\">{{Citation | last = Newcomb | first = Horace | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXgj7a55agC&pg=PA1068 | title = Encyclopedia of Television | page = 1068 | publisher = CRC Press | format = Google books | year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Lord Steve McGarrett Hawaii Five-O 1977.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Jack Lord]] played Steve McGarrett.]]\n\nMcGarrett's tousled yet immaculate hairstyle, as well as his proclivity for wearing a dark suit and tie on all possible occasions (uncommon in the islands), rapidly entered popular culture. While the other members of ''Five-O'' \"dressed mainland\" much of the time, they also often wore local styles, such as the ubiquitous [[Aloha shirt]].\n\nIn many episodes (including the pilot), McGarrett is drawn into the world of international [[espionage]] and [[Military espionage|national intelligence]]. McGarrett's nemesis is a rogue intelligence officer of the [[People's Republic of China]] named [[Wo Fat]].  The [[communist]] rogue agent was played by veteran actor [[Khigh Dhiegh]]. In the show's final episode in 1980, titled \"Woe to Wo Fat\", McGarrett finally sees his foe go to jail.<ref name=\"Snauffer\" />\n\nUnlike the reboot the show's action and straightforward storytelling left little time for personal stories involving wives or girlfriends,<ref name=\"Newcomb\" /> though a two-part story in the first season dealt with the loss of McGarrett's sister's baby. Occasionally, a show would flash back to McGarrett's younger years or to a romantic figure.\n\nIn the episode \"Number One with a Bullet, Part 2\", McGarrett tells a criminal, \"It was a bastard like you who killed my father.\" His 42-year-old father had been run down and killed by someone who had just held up a supermarket. Because Steve McGarrett is also a commander in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]], he sometimes uses their resources to help investigate and solve crimes. Hence the closing credits of some episodes mentioned the Naval Reserve.<ref>{{Citation | place = US | publisher = Navy | format = PDF | url = http://navyhistory.med.navy.mil/Publications/Booklets/Nurse%20Corps%20Miscellany1.pdf | title = Nurse Corps Miscellany, 1910\u20132008 | page = 20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227115415/http://navyhistory.med.navy.mil/Publications/Booklets/Nurse%20Corps%20Miscellany1.pdf | archivedate = 2009-02-27 }}</ref>  A 1975 episode involving Danno's aunt, played by MacArthur's mother [[Helen Hayes]], provided a bit of Williams' back story.\n\n==Creation of the show==\nSources differ on how the show came to be.

One source states the idea for the show may have come from a conversation Freeman had with Hawaii's then-Governor [[John A.

Test audiences apparently were not positive on O'Kelly, however, and the producers replaced him with [[James MacArthur]].\n\n[[Kam Fong Chun]], an 18-year veteran of the [[Honolulu Police Department]], auditioned for the part of the lead villain Wo Fat, but Freeman cast him in the part of Chin Ho Kelly instead. Freeman took the name Wo Fat from a restaurant in downtown Honolulu.

The show then moved to a [[Fort Ruger]] location for seasons two to eight. A third studio was built at [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]], and was used during the last four seasons.\n\nA problem from the beginning was the lack of a movie industry in Hawaii. Much of the crew and cast, including many locals who ended up participating in the show, had to learn their respective jobs as they went along. Jack Lord was known as a perfectionist who insisted on the best from everyone.<ref name=\"obit\">Mifflin, Lawrie.  [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E5DC173BF930A15752C0A96E958260 \"Jack Lord, 77, Helped Direct And Starred In 'Hawaii Five-O'\"], ''The New York Times'' (1998-01-23).</ref> His temper flared when he felt that others did not give their best, but in later reunions they admitted that Lord's hard-driving force had made them better actors and made ''Hawaii Five-O'' a better show. Lord's high standards helped the show last another six years after Leonard Freeman's death from heart trouble during the sixth season.<ref name=\"obit\" />\n\nTo critics and viewers, there was no question that Jack Lord was the center of the show, and that the other actors frequently served as little more than props, standing and watching while McGarrett emoted and paced around his office, analyzing the crime. But occasionally episodes would focus on the other actors, and let them showcase their own talents, such as Danno defusing bombs in \"The Clock Struck Twelve\". Since Jack Lord had a financial interest in the show, he referred to other regular cast actors in the program as a \"with\", as in \"With James MacArthur\"; they were never called \"co-stars\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Hayward |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/james-macarthur-actor-best-known-as-danno-in-hawaii-five0-2120546.html |title=James MacArthur: Actor best known as Danno in 'Hawaii Five-0' &#124; Obituaries &#124; News |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>\n\nVery few episodes were shot outside of Hawaii.

The line he spoke was, \"This is Jack Lord inviting you to be with us next week for <name of episode>\" and then, \"Be here. Aloha.\" The promos were removed from the syndicated episodes but most have been restored in DVD releases from the second season through the ninth. Most of the promos are slightly edited to remove references to \"next week\".\n\nThis tradition has been continued in the 2010 version of ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'', but is not limited to [[Alex O'Loughlin]].  All of the primary cast members take turns with the iconic \"Be here. Aloha\" line at the end of the preview segment.\n\nThere were two versions of the closing credits portion of the show. During the first season, the theme music was played over a short film of a flashing blue light attached to the rear of a police motorcycle in [[Waikiki]] heading west (the film is shown at twice the normal speed, as can be seen from people crossing a street behind the police motorcycle).<ref>{{YouTube|pfvn16IzKPc|Hawaii Five-O Theme Song and Closing Sequence}}</ref> In later seasons, the same music was played over film of outrigger canoeists battling the surf.\n\nIn a 2010 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', the show's opening title sequence ranked No. 4 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.<ref>Tomashoff, Craig. \"Credits Check\" ''TV Guide'', October 18, 2010, Pages 16\u201317</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe show was the longest-running crime show on American television until ''[[Law & Order]]'' surpassed it in 2002, and was the first to enjoy an uninterrupted run that exceeded a decade (it has since been joined in that distinction by several other series including ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and [[NCIS (TV series)|''NCIS'']]).\n\nWhen the show premiered in 1968 Hawaii had been a state for only 9 years and was relatively obscure to Americans who had never served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], but as a geographic part of [[Polynesia]] it had an exotic image.\n\nKnown for the location, theme song, and ensemble cast, ''Hawaii Five-O'' contains a heavy use of exterior location shooting throughout the entire 12 seasons.  A typical episode, on average, would have at least two-thirds of all footage shot on location, as opposed to a \"typical\" show of the time which would be shot largely on [[sound stage]]s and [[backlot]]s. It is also remembered for its unusual setting during an era when most crime dramas of the era were set in or around the [[Los Angeles]] or [[New York City]] areas.\n\nThe Hawaii-based television show ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' was created after ''Hawaii Five-O'' ended its run, in order to make further use of the expensive production facilities created there for ''Five-O''. The first few ''Magnum P.I.'' episodes made direct references to ''Five-O'', suggesting that it takes place in the same [[fictional setting]]. ''Magnum''{{'}}s producers made a few attempts to coax Jack Lord out of retirement for a [[cameo appearance]], but he refused.<ref name = \"Snauffer\">{{Citation | last = Snauffer | first = Douglas | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PTRxMv8LQosC&pg=PA59 | format = Google books | title = Crime Television | page = 59 | publisher = Greenwood | year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nMany local people were cast in the show, which was ethnically diverse by the standards of the late 1960s.<ref name = \"Newcomb\" /> The first run and syndication were seen by an estimated 400 million people around the world.\n\n\"Bored, She Hung Herself\", the 16th episode of the second season, depicted a Five-O investigation into the apparent suicide of a woman by hanging, which she was supposedly practicing as part of a health regimen.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FruSwC9UjwC&pg=PA66&dq=%22Bored+she+hung+herself%22#v=twopage&q=%22Bored%20she%20hung%20herself%22&f=false |title=Booking Hawaii Five-O: An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968\u20131980 Television Detective Series |format=Google eBook |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> A viewer reportedly died trying the same technique, and as a result, the episode was not rebroadcast, was never included in any syndication packages, and has not been included on any DVD release of the show to date.<ref>[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/08/03/features/story06.html \"Episode cut from 'Five-0' second-season set\"], ''Honolulu Star-Bulletin'' (2007-08-03).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Hawaii-Five-O-Season-2-REGION-4-DVD-FREE-AUST-POSTAGE-/380636519898 |title=Hawaii Five O Season 2 REGION 4 DVD FREE AUST POSTAGE |publisher=eBay |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>  The family of the person who died in the real-life hanging sued CBS over the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/have-you-ever-seen-the-lost-episode-of-hawaii-five-o|title=Have you ever seen the lost, banned episode of 'Hawaii Five-O'?|publisher=Me-TV Network}}</ref>\n\n===Remake projects===\nA one-hour pilot for a new series was made in 1996 but never aired.

James MacArthur returned as Dan Williams, having become governor of Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoT2BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA73&dq=%22Hawaii%20Five-O%22%20(1997%20TV%20pilot)&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q=%22Hawaii%20Five-O%22%20(1997%20TV%20pilot)&f=false |title=Cop Shows: A Critical History of Police Dramas on Television \u2013 Roger Sabin, Linda Speidel, Ronald Wilson, Ben Bethell, Brian Faucette \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> Several cameos were made by other ''Five-O'' regulars, including Kam Fong as Chin Ho Kelly<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxTx1xK-q14C&lpg=PA118&dq=%22Hawaii%20Five-O%22%201997%20pilot%20-wikipedia&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q=%22Hawaii%20Five-O%22%201997%20pilot%20-wikipedia&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Television Pilots, 1937\u20132012 \u2013 Vincent Terrace \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> (even though the character had been killed off at the end of Season 10).{{Citation needed |date=November 2014}}\n\nA remake pilot, called ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' (the last character is a zero instead of the letter \"O\", which is the true title of the original series as well), aired September 20, 2010, on [[CBS]], and as of October 2013, the series now airs Friday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Central time.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The remake version ''Hawaii Five-0'' uses the same principal character names as the original, and the new Steve McGarrett's late father's vintage 1974 [[Mercury Marquis]] is the actual car driven by Lord in the original series's final seasons.  The new series opening credit sequence is an homage to the original; the theme song is cut in half, from 60 to 30 seconds, but is an otherwise identical instrumentation. Most of the iconic shots are replicated, beginning with the helicopter approach and close-up turn of McGarrett at the Ilikai Hotel penthouse, the jet engine [[nacelle]], a hula dancer's hips, the quickly stepped zoom-in to the face of the [[Columbia (name)#Personification|Lady Columbia statue]] at [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific|Punchbowl]], the close-up of the [[Kamehameha Statue]]'s face, and the ending with a police motorcycle's [[emergency vehicle lighting|flashing blue light]]. The surname of recurring character Governor Sam Denning (played by [[Richard T. Jones]]) is a nod to actor [[Richard Denning]], who played the Governor in the original series. Starting with the Season 7 many of the clips that were part of the original opening were removed and more action shots of the cast were included. On the March 19, 2012 episode, [[Ed Asner]] reprised his role as \"August March\", a character he first played in a 1975 episode. Clips from the 1975 episode were included in the new one, even though the 2010 series is intended to be in a different narrative universe than the Jack Lord series.\n\n===Theme music===\nAnother legacy of the show is the popularity of the ''Hawaii Five-O'' theme music. The tune was composed by [[Morton Stevens]], who also composed numerous episode scores performed by the CBS Orchestra. The theme was later recorded by [[the Ventures]], whose version reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop chart,<ref name = \"Newcomb\" /> and is particularly popular with college and high school [[marching band]]s, especially at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaii]] where it has become the unofficial fight song. The tune has also been heard at [[Robertson Stadium]] after [[Houston Dynamo]] goals scored by [[Brian Ching]], a native of Hawaii.  Because of the tempo of the music, the theme gained popularity in the UK with followers of [[Northern soul]] and was popular on [[Performance surface|dance floors]] in the 1970s.<ref name = \"Northern Soul\">{{cite web | url= http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/articlensdead.htm | title=Northern Soul Is Dead! | publisher= Soulful kinda music  | accessdate= June 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the theme is most widely known as an instrumental, it has been released with at least two similar but different sets of lyrics. The first, \"You Can Come with Me\" by [[Don Ho]], opens with an instrumental in the familiar tempo, then settles into a ballad style for the sung portion.<ref>[http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/5-0lyrics.txt Don Ho version of theme song] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310164005/http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/5-0lyrics.txt |date=2009-03-10 }} (lyrics only)</ref>  The second, by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], titled \"You Can ''Count on'' Me (Theme from Hawaii Five-O)\", maintains the driving style of the original instrumental throughout.<ref>[http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/youcancount.ram Sammy Davis Jr. version of theme song] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808015256/http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/youcancount.ram |date=2007-08-08 }} (audio).</ref>\n\nAustralian [[proto-punk]] band [[Radio Birdman]] borrowed heavily from the program and its theme for their 1977 single \"Aloha, Steve & Danno\", later included on selected versions of the album ''[[Radios Appear]]''.  Band leader [[Deniz Tek]], who grew up in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] during the heyday of [[MC5]] and [[The Stooges]], commented that he found [[Sydney]] of the early 1970s to be a rather quiet and staid place in comparison, and that airings of the program were a weekly highlight.  The song was written after the band members realized they were spending a lot of evenings watching the program.  The lyrics of the song's verses consist entirely of references to story lines of the early episodes.  The chorus alludes to the boredom which band members experienced when the program wasn't on.  The song's guitar solos and other elements of the music were directly derivative of the program's theme; Stevens received a writing credit on the song as a result.\n\nIn the Australian movie ''The Dish'', the theme was mistaken for the national anthem of the US by a local band upon the visit of the US Ambassador to Parkes, [[New South Wales|NSW]], to commemorate the 1969 Moon landing.\n\n[[Bill Murray]] sang his own made-up lyrics to the song on one of his \"Nick the Lounge Singer\" skits on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nOn the 1997 ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' episode \"Volcanoes\", the MIDI version of \"Hawaii Five-O\" was used during the \"Pahoehoe Five-O\" segments.\n\nThe song  was also featured in the film ''[[50 First Dates]]'' (2004), and the Sammy Davis Jr. version of the theme song was re-recorded by Los Straitjackets with Deke Dickerson and released in 2014.\n\n[[Darts]] player [[Wayne Mardle]] used the song as his walk-on song in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/other-sport/darts/2013/01/04/bdo-world-title-hopeful-coming-up/ |title=BDO world title hopeful on way |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=20 December 2013 |newspaper=[[Express & Star]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Ventures version appears in a [[2019 in American television|2019]] TV commercial for \n[[Papa John's Pizza]].\n\n===Slang term for police===\nThe phrase \"Five-O\" (or any variation, such as \"5\u20130\", \"5-o\", and \"five O\", all usually pronounced \"five oh\") has come to refer to the [[police]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Rhodes1997\">{{cite book|author=Karen Rhodes|title=Booking Hawaii Five-O: An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968\u20131980 Television Detective Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FruSwC9UjwC&pg=PA265|date=1 February 1997|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8666-3|page=265}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series) episodes}}\n\n==Broadcast history==\n* September 1968 \u2013 December 1968: Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* December 1968 \u2013 March 1971: Wednesdays at 10:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* September 1971 \u2013 February 1974: Tuesdays at 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\n* September 1974 \u2013 March 1975: Tuesdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* September 1975 \u2013 November 1975: Fridays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* December 1975 \u2013 November 1979: Thursdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* December 1979 \u2013 January 1980: Tuesdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* March 1980 \u2013 April 1980: Saturdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===Syndication===\n''Hawaii Five-O'' survived long enough to overlap with reruns of early episodes, which were broadcast by CBS in their late night schedule while new episodes were still being produced. Once the program entered [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] after the original run of the series, CBS broadcast reruns of season 12 in late night under the title ''McGarrett'' to avoid confusion with the episodes in syndication broadcast under the title ''Hawaii Five-O.'' Currently, [[MeTV]] airs the series occasionally as part of its broadcast schedule.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the series first aired on [[ITV network|ITV]] on July 19, 1970 in a Saturday evening timeslot.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Emmys===\n*'''Wins'''\n**1970: Outstanding Musical Composition: Morton Stevens, \"A Thousand Pardons, You're Dead!\"\n**1974: Best Music Composition&nbsp;\u2013 Series: Morton Stevens, \"Hookman\"\n*'''Nominations'''\n**1969: Outstanding Cinematography: Frank Phillips, \"Up-Tight\"\n**1969: Outstanding Musical Composition: Morton Stevens, the pilot\n**1971: Outstanding Film Editing: Arthur David Hilton, \"Over Fifty?

Unlike many albums of television music of the time, the music was taken directly from the scoring sessions rather than being specially re-recorded for album release. One of the instrumental pieces on the album, \"Call to Danger\", was originally recorded for the unsold 1967 pilot of the same name and also excerpted as background music accompanying a \"Special Presentation\" logo that [[CBS]] used to introduce its prime time [[television special]]s throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The album was re-issued on compact disc by [[Film Score Monthly]] in 2010.\n\n# \"Hawaii Five-0\" (1:32)\n# \"Call to Danger\" (1:48)\n# \"McGarrett's Theme\" (2:25)\n# \"Front Street\" (2:42)\n# \"The Long Wait\" (2:18)\n# \"Blues Trip\" (3:14)\n# \"The Floater\" (2:23)\n# \"Interlude\" (1:53)\n# \"Operation Smash\" (2:05)\n# \"Beach Trip\" (2:30)\n# \"Up Tight\" (2:05)\n# \"The Chase/Hawaii Five-0\" (4:36)\n\n''Hawaii Five-O'' was the subject of six [[novelization]]s. Each one had a plot line written for the book and was not based on a television episode. The first two books were published by Signet Paperbacks in 1968 and 1969. After that were two juvenile hard covers published by Whitman publishing in 1969 and 1971 and finally two more books were published in England.<ref>Rhodes, Karen.

Many episodes would end with McGarrett instructing his subordinate to \"'''Book 'em, Danno!'''\"<!--Phrase is bolded as it is a [[WP:REDIRECT]]-->, sometimes specifying a charge such as \"[[Murder#Degrees of murder|murder one]]\".\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[CBS]] television network [[CBS Productions|produced]] ''Hawaii Five-O'', which aired from September 20, 1968, to April 5, 1980. The program continues to be broadcast in [[Television syndication|syndication]] worldwide. Created by [[Leonard Freeman]], ''Hawaii Five-O'' was shot on location in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], and throughout the island of [[Oahu]] and other [[Hawaiian islands]] with occasional filming in locales such as [[Los Angeles]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]].\n\nThe show centers on a fictional state police force led by former US naval officer Steve McGarrett (played by [[Jack Lord]]), a detective captain, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], Paul Jameson. In the show, McGarrett oversees state police officers \u2013 the young Danny Williams, veteran Chin Ho Kelly, and streetwise Kono Kalakaua for seasons one through four. [[Honolulu Police Department]] Officer Duke Lukela joined the team as a regular, as did Ben Kokua, who replaced Kono beginning with season five. Occasionally, McGarrett's Five-O team is assisted by other officers as needed: [[Douglas Mossman]] as Det. Frank Kamana, P.O. Sandi Wells ([[Amanda McBroom]]), medical examiner Doc Bergman (Al Eben), forensic specialist Che Fong ([[Harry Endo]]), and a secretary. The first secretary was May, then Jenny, and later Malia, Lani and Luana.<ref name=\"Terrace\">{{Citation | last = Terrace | first = Vincent | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&pg=PA187 | title = Encyclopedia of Television Series, Pilots and Specials | page = 187 | format = Google books | publisher = Verlag f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wirtschaft | year = 1986}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Five-O'' team consists of three to five members (small for a real state police unit), and is portrayed as occupying a suite of offices in the [[\u02bbIolani Palace|Iolani Palace]].<ref name = \"Snauffer\" /> Five-O lacks its own radio network, necessitating frequent requests by McGarrett to the Honolulu Police Department dispatchers.\n\nFor 12 seasons, McGarrett and his team hounded international secret agents, criminals, and [[organized crime]] syndicates plaguing the Hawaiian Islands. With the aid of [[District Attorney]] and later [[Attorney General of Hawaii|Hawaii's Attorney General]] John Manicote, McGarrett is successful in sending most of his enemies to [[prison]]. One such crime syndicate was led by crime family patriarch Honore Vashon, a character introduced in the fifth season. Other criminals and organized crime bosses on the islands were played by actors such as [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Gavin MacLeod]], and [[Ross Martin]] as Tony Alika.\n\nBy the 12th and final season, series regular James MacArthur had left the show (in 1996, he admitted that he had become tired of the role and wanted to do other things), as had Kam Fong. Unlike other characters before him, Fong's character, Chin Ho, at Fong's request, was killed off, murdered while working undercover to expose a protection ring in Chinatown in the last episode of season 10. New characters Jim 'Kimo' Carew ([[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]]), Lori Wilson ([[Sharon Farrell]]), and Truck ([[Moe Keale]]) were introduced in season 12 alongside returning regular character Duke Lukela.<ref name=\"Terrace\" />\n\nMost episodes of ''Hawaii Five-O'' ended with the arrest of criminals and McGarrett snapping, \"Book 'em.\" The offense occasionally was added after this phrase, for example, \"Book 'em, murder one.\" In many episodes, this was directed to Danny Williams and became McGarrett's [[catchphrase]]: \"Book 'em, Danno.\"<ref name=\"Newcomb\">{{Citation | last = Newcomb | first = Horace | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXgj7a55agC&pg=PA1068 | title = Encyclopedia of Television | page = 1068 | publisher = CRC Press | format = Google books | year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Lord Steve McGarrett Hawaii Five-O 1977.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Jack Lord]] played Steve McGarrett.]]\n\nMcGarrett's tousled yet immaculate hairstyle, as well as his proclivity for wearing a dark suit and tie on all possible occasions (uncommon in the islands), rapidly entered popular culture. While the other members of ''Five-O'' \"dressed mainland\" much of the time, they also often wore local styles, such as the ubiquitous [[Aloha shirt]].\n\nIn many episodes (including the pilot), McGarrett is drawn into the world of international [[espionage]] and [[Military espionage|national intelligence]]. McGarrett's nemesis is a rogue intelligence officer of the [[People's Republic of China]] named [[Wo Fat]].  The [[communist]] rogue agent was played by veteran actor [[Khigh Dhiegh]]. In the show's final episode in 1980, titled \"Woe to Wo Fat\", McGarrett finally sees his foe go to jail.<ref name=\"Snauffer\" />\n\nUnlike the reboot the show's action and straightforward storytelling left little time for personal stories involving wives or girlfriends,<ref name=\"Newcomb\" /> though a two-part story in the first season dealt with the loss of McGarrett's sister's baby. Occasionally, a show would flash back to McGarrett's younger years or to a romantic figure.\n\nIn the episode \"Number One with a Bullet, Part 2\", McGarrett tells a criminal, \"It was a bastard like you who killed my father.\" His 42-year-old father had been run down and killed by someone who had just held up a supermarket. Because Steve McGarrett is also a commander in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]], he sometimes uses their resources to help investigate and solve crimes. Hence the closing credits of some episodes mentioned the Naval Reserve.<ref>{{Citation | place = US | publisher = Navy | format = PDF | url = http://navyhistory.med.navy.mil/Publications/Booklets/Nurse%20Corps%20Miscellany1.pdf | title = Nurse Corps Miscellany, 1910\u20132008 | page = 20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227115415/http://navyhistory.med.navy.mil/Publications/Booklets/Nurse%20Corps%20Miscellany1.pdf | archivedate = 2009-02-27 }}</ref>  A 1975 episode involving Danno's aunt, played by MacArthur's mother [[Helen Hayes]], provided a bit of Williams' back story.\n\n==Creation of the show==\nSources differ on how the show came to be.

The show then moved to a [[Fort Ruger]] location for seasons two to eight.

Much of the crew and cast, including many locals who ended up participating in the show, had to learn their respective jobs as they went along. Jack Lord was known as a perfectionist who insisted on the best from everyone.<ref name=\"obit\">Mifflin, Lawrie.

But occasionally episodes would focus on the other actors, and let them showcase their own talents, such as Danno defusing bombs in \"The Clock Struck Twelve\". Since Jack Lord had a financial interest in the show, he referred to other regular cast actors in the program as a \"with\", as in \"With James MacArthur\"; they were never called \"co-stars\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Hayward |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/james-macarthur-actor-best-known-as-danno-in-hawaii-five0-2120546.html |title=James MacArthur: Actor best known as Danno in 'Hawaii Five-0' &#124; Obituaries &#124; News |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>\n\nVery few episodes were shot outside of Hawaii.

The line he spoke was, \"This is Jack Lord inviting you to be with us next week for <name of episode>\" and then, \"Be here. Aloha.\" The promos were removed from the syndicated episodes but most have been restored in DVD releases from the second season through the ninth. Most of the promos are slightly edited to remove references to \"next week\".\n\nThis tradition has been continued in the 2010 version of ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'', but is not limited to [[Alex O'Loughlin]].  All of the primary cast members take turns with the iconic \"Be here. Aloha\" line at the end of the preview segment.\n\nThere were two versions of the closing credits portion of the show. During the first season, the theme music was played over a short film of a flashing blue light attached to the rear of a police motorcycle in [[Waikiki]] heading west (the film is shown at twice the normal speed, as can be seen from people crossing a street behind the police motorcycle).<ref>{{YouTube|pfvn16IzKPc|Hawaii Five-O Theme Song and Closing Sequence}}</ref> In later seasons, the same music was played over film of outrigger canoeists battling the surf.\n\nIn a 2010 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', the show's opening title sequence ranked No. 4 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.<ref>Tomashoff, Craig. \"Credits Check\" ''TV Guide'', October 18, 2010, Pages 16\u201317</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe show was the longest-running crime show on American television until ''[[Law & Order]]'' surpassed it in 2002, and was the first to enjoy an uninterrupted run that exceeded a decade (it has since been joined in that distinction by several other series including ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and [[NCIS (TV series)|''NCIS'']]).\n\nWhen the show premiered in 1968 Hawaii had been a state for only 9 years and was relatively obscure to Americans who had never served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], but as a geographic part of [[Polynesia]] it had an exotic image.\n\nKnown for the location, theme song, and ensemble cast, ''Hawaii Five-O'' contains a heavy use of exterior location shooting throughout the entire 12 seasons.  A typical episode, on average, would have at least two-thirds of all footage shot on location, as opposed to a \"typical\" show of the time which would be shot largely on [[sound stage]]s and [[backlot]]s. It is also remembered for its unusual setting during an era when most crime dramas of the era were set in or around the [[Los Angeles]] or [[New York City]] areas.\n\nThe Hawaii-based television show ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' was created after ''Hawaii Five-O'' ended its run, in order to make further use of the expensive production facilities created there for ''Five-O''. The first few ''Magnum P.I.'' episodes made direct references to ''Five-O'', suggesting that it takes place in the same [[fictional setting]].

The new series opening credit sequence is an homage to the original; the theme song is cut in half, from 60 to 30 seconds, but is an otherwise identical instrumentation. Most of the iconic shots are replicated, beginning with the helicopter approach and close-up turn of McGarrett at the Ilikai Hotel penthouse, the jet engine [[nacelle]], a hula dancer's hips, the quickly stepped zoom-in to the face of the [[Columbia (name)#Personification|Lady Columbia statue]] at [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific|Punchbowl]], the close-up of the [[Kamehameha Statue]]'s face, and the ending with a police motorcycle's [[emergency vehicle lighting|flashing blue light]]. The surname of recurring character Governor Sam Denning (played by [[Richard T. Jones]]) is a nod to actor [[Richard Denning]], who played the Governor in the original series. Starting with the Season 7 many of the clips that were part of the original opening were removed and more action shots of the cast were included. On the March 19, 2012 episode, [[Ed Asner]] reprised his role as \"August March\", a character he first played in a 1975 episode. Clips from the 1975 episode were included in the new one, even though the 2010 series is intended to be in a different narrative universe than the Jack Lord series.\n\n===Theme music===\nAnother legacy of the show is the popularity of the ''Hawaii Five-O'' theme music. The tune was composed by [[Morton Stevens]], who also composed numerous episode scores performed by the CBS Orchestra. The theme was later recorded by [[the Ventures]], whose version reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop chart,<ref name = \"Newcomb\" /> and is particularly popular with college and high school [[marching band]]s, especially at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaii]] where it has become the unofficial fight song. The tune has also been heard at [[Robertson Stadium]] after [[Houston Dynamo]] goals scored by [[Brian Ching]], a native of Hawaii.  Because of the tempo of the music, the theme gained popularity in the UK with followers of [[Northern soul]] and was popular on [[Performance surface|dance floors]] in the 1970s.<ref name = \"Northern Soul\">{{cite web | url= http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/articlensdead.htm | title=Northern Soul Is Dead! | publisher= Soulful kinda music  | accessdate= June 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the theme is most widely known as an instrumental, it has been released with at least two similar but different sets of lyrics. The first, \"You Can Come with Me\" by [[Don Ho]], opens with an instrumental in the familiar tempo, then settles into a ballad style for the sung portion.<ref>[http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/5-0lyrics.txt Don Ho version of theme song] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310164005/http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/5-0lyrics.txt |date=2009-03-10 }} (lyrics only)</ref>  The second, by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], titled \"You Can ''Count on'' Me (Theme from Hawaii Five-O)\", maintains the driving style of the original instrumental throughout.<ref>[http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/youcancount.ram Sammy Davis Jr. version of theme song] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808015256/http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/youcancount.ram |date=2007-08-08 }} (audio).</ref>\n\nAustralian [[proto-punk]] band [[Radio Birdman]] borrowed heavily from the program and its theme for their 1977 single \"Aloha, Steve & Danno\", later included on selected versions of the album ''[[Radios Appear]]''.  Band leader [[Deniz Tek]], who grew up in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] during the heyday of [[MC5]] and [[The Stooges]], commented that he found [[Sydney]] of the early 1970s to be a rather quiet and staid place in comparison, and that airings of the program were a weekly highlight.  The song was written after the band members realized they were spending a lot of evenings watching the program.  The lyrics of the song's verses consist entirely of references to story lines of the early episodes.  The chorus alludes to the boredom which band members experienced when the program wasn't on.  The song's guitar solos and other elements of the music were directly derivative of the program's theme; Stevens received a writing credit on the song as a result.\n\nIn the Australian movie ''The Dish'', the theme was mistaken for the national anthem of the US by a local band upon the visit of the US Ambassador to Parkes, [[New South Wales|NSW]], to commemorate the 1969 Moon landing.\n\n[[Bill Murray]] sang his own made-up lyrics to the song on one of his \"Nick the Lounge Singer\" skits on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nOn the 1997 ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' episode \"Volcanoes\", the MIDI version of \"Hawaii Five-O\" was used during the \"Pahoehoe Five-O\" segments.\n\nThe song  was also featured in the film ''[[50 First Dates]]'' (2004), and the Sammy Davis Jr. version of the theme song was re-recorded by Los Straitjackets with Deke Dickerson and released in 2014.\n\n[[Darts]] player [[Wayne Mardle]] used the song as his walk-on song in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/other-sport/darts/2013/01/04/bdo-world-title-hopeful-coming-up/ |title=BDO world title hopeful on way |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=20 December 2013 |newspaper=[[Express & Star]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Ventures version appears in a [[2019 in American television|2019]] TV commercial for \n[[Papa John's Pizza]].\n\n===Slang term for police===\nThe phrase \"Five-O\" (or any variation, such as \"5\u20130\", \"5-o\", and \"five O\", all usually pronounced \"five oh\") has come to refer to the [[police]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Rhodes1997\">{{cite book|author=Karen Rhodes|title=Booking Hawaii Five-O: An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968\u20131980 Television Detective Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FruSwC9UjwC&pg=PA265|date=1 February 1997|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8666-3|page=265}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series) episodes}}\n\n==Broadcast history==\n* September 1968 \u2013 December 1968: Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* December 1968 \u2013 March 1971: Wednesdays at 10:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* September 1971 \u2013 February 1974: Tuesdays at 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\n* September 1974 \u2013 March 1975: Tuesdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* September 1975 \u2013 November 1975: Fridays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* December 1975 \u2013 November 1979: Thursdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* December 1979 \u2013 January 1980: Tuesdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n* March 1980 \u2013 April 1980: Saturdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===Syndication===\n''Hawaii Five-O'' survived long enough to overlap with reruns of early episodes, which were broadcast by CBS in their late night schedule while new episodes were still being produced. Once the program entered [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] after the original run of the series, CBS broadcast reruns of season 12 in late night under the title ''McGarrett'' to avoid confusion with the episodes in syndication broadcast under the title ''Hawaii Five-O.'' Currently, [[MeTV]] airs the series occasionally as part of its broadcast schedule.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the series first aired on [[ITV network|ITV]] on July 19, 1970 in a Saturday evening timeslot.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Emmys===\n*'''Wins'''\n**1970: Outstanding Musical Composition: Morton Stevens, \"A Thousand Pardons, You're Dead!\"\n**1974: Best Music Composition&nbsp;\u2013 Series: Morton Stevens, \"Hookman\"\n*'''Nominations'''\n**1969: Outstanding Cinematography: Frank Phillips, \"Up-Tight\"\n**1969: Outstanding Musical Composition: Morton Stevens, the pilot\n**1971: Outstanding Film Editing: Arthur David Hilton, \"Over Fifty?

Unlike many albums of television music of the time, the music was taken directly from the scoring sessions rather than being specially re-recorded for album release. One of the instrumental pieces on the album, \"Call to Danger\", was originally recorded for the unsold 1967 pilot of the same name and also excerpted as background music accompanying a \"Special Presentation\" logo that [[CBS]] used to introduce its prime time [[television special]]s throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The album was re-issued on compact disc by [[Film Score Monthly]] in 2010.\n\n# \"Hawaii Five-0\" (1:32)\n# \"Call to Danger\" (1:48)\n# \"McGarrett's Theme\" (2:25)\n# \"Front Street\" (2:42)\n# \"The Long Wait\" (2:18)\n# \"Blues Trip\" (3:14)\n# \"The Floater\" (2:23)\n# \"Interlude\" (1:53)\n# \"Operation Smash\" (2:05)\n# \"Beach Trip\" (2:30)\n# \"Up Tight\" (2:05)\n# \"The Chase/Hawaii Five-0\" (4:36)\n\n''Hawaii Five-O'' was the subject of six [[novelization]]s. Each one had a plot line written for the book and was not based on a television episode. The first two books were published by Signet Paperbacks in 1968 and 1969. After that were two juvenile hard covers published by Whitman publishing in 1969 and 1971 and finally two more books were published in England.<ref>Rhodes, Karen.

(It was not connected to an earlier ''[[New York Daily News (19th century)|New York Daily News]]'', which was founded in 1855, flourished under [[Benjamin Wood (American politician)|Benjamin Wood]], and ceased publication in December 1906.) Patterson and his cousin, [[Robert R.

On his return, Patterson met with [[Alfred Harmsworth]], who was the Viscount Northcliffe and publisher of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', London's tabloid newspaper. Impressed with the advantages of a tabloid, Patterson launched the ''Daily News'' on June 26, 1919.<ref name=MedillBio /> The ''Daily News'' would be owned by the Tribune Company until 1993.<ref name=\"New York Daily News\">{{cite web |last1=McShane |first1=Larry |title=Mortimer B.

The paper's later slogan, developed from a 1985 ad campaign, is \"New York's Hometown Newspaper\", while another has been \"The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York\". The ''Daily News'' continues to include large and prominent [[photography|photographs]], for news, entertainment and sports, as well as intense city news coverage, [[Gossip column|celebrity gossip]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], [[comics]], a [[sports]] section, and an opinion section.\n\nNews-gathering operations were, for a time, organized by staff using two-way radios operating on 173.3250&nbsp;MHz (radio station KEA 871), allowing the assignment desk to communicate with its reporters who used a fleet of \"radio cars\".\n\nProminent sports [[cartoonist]]s have included [[Bill Gallo]], [[Bruce Stark]] and [[Ed Murawinski]].

Upon his death later that year, the ''News'' seceded from his publishing empire which soon splintered under questions about whether Maxwell had the financial backing to sustain it. Existing management, led by editor [[James Willse]], held the ''News'' together in bankruptcy; Willse became interim publisher after buying the paper from the Tribune Company.

(It was not connected to an earlier ''[[New York Daily News (19th century)|New York Daily News]]'', which was founded in 1855, flourished under [[Benjamin Wood]], and ceased publication in December 1906.) Patterson and his cousin, [[Robert R. McCormick]], were co-publishers of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and grandsons of [[Tribune Company]] founder Joseph Medill.<ref name=MedillBio>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 648\u201351: \"Patterson, Joseph Medill\"</ref>\n\nWhen Patterson and McCormick could not agree on the editorial content of the Chicago paper, the two cousins decided at a meeting in Paris that Patterson would work on the project of launching a Tribune-owned newspaper in New York. On his return, Patterson met with [[Alfred Harmsworth]], who was the Viscount Northcliffe and publisher of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', London's tabloid newspaper. Impressed with the advantages of a tabloid, Patterson launched the ''Daily News'' on June 26, 1919.<ref name=MedillBio /> The ''Daily News'' would be owned by the Tribune Company until 1993.<ref name=\"New York Daily News\">{{cite web |last1=McShane |first1=Larry |title=Mortimer B.

By the time of the paper's first anniversary in June 1920, circulation had climbed over 100,000 and by 1925, over a million. Circulation reached its peak in 1947, at 2.4 million daily and 4.7 million on Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.company-histories.com/New-York-Daily-News-Company-History.html|title=New York Daily News|publisher=Company-Histories.com}|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Daily News'' carried the slogan \"New York's Picture Newspaper\" from 1920 to 1991, for its emphasis on photographs. A camera has been part of the newspaper's logo from day one. The paper's later slogan, developed from a 1985 ad campaign, is \"New York's Hometown Newspaper\", while another has been \"The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York\". The ''Daily News'' continues to include large and prominent [[photography|photographs]], for news, entertainment and sports, as well as intense city news coverage, [[Gossip column|celebrity gossip]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], [[comics]], a [[sports]] section, and an opinion section.\n\nNews-gathering operations were, for a time, organized by staff using two-way radios operating on 173.3250&nbsp;MHz (radio station KEA 871), allowing the assignment desk to communicate with its reporters who used a fleet of \"radio cars\".\n\nProminent sports [[cartoonist]]s have included [[Bill Gallo]], [[Bruce Stark]] and [[Ed Murawinski]]. Columnists have included [[Walter Kaner]]. Editorial cartoonists have included [[C. D.

In the 1982 instance, the parent Tribune Company offered the tabloid up for sale. In 1991, millionaire Robert Maxwell offered financial assistance to the ''News'' to help it stay in business. Upon his death later that year, the ''News'' seceded from his publishing empire which soon splintered under questions about whether Maxwell had the financial backing to sustain it. Existing management, led by editor [[James Willse]], held the ''News'' together in bankruptcy; Willse became interim publisher after buying the paper from the Tribune Company. [[Mortimer Zuckerman|Mort Zuckerman]] bought the paper in 1993.<ref name=\"New York Daily News\"/>\n\nIn 1948, the ''News'' established [[WPIX]] (Channel 11 in New York City), whose call letters were based on the ''News''{{'}}s nickname of \"New York's Picture Newspaper\"; and later bought what became WPIX-FM, which is now known as [[WFAN-FM]]. The television station became a Tribune property outright in 1991, and remains in the former Daily News Building. The radio station was purchased by [[Emmis Communications]], and since 2014 has been owned by [[CBS Radio]] as an FM simulcast of [[WFAN (AM)|its AM namesake]].\n\nThe ''News'' also maintains local bureaus in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, at [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], within [[One Police Plaza]], and at the various state and federal courthouses in the city.\n\nIn January 2012, former ''[[News of the World]]'' and ''New York Post'' editor [[Colin Myler]] was appointed editor-in-chief of the ''Daily News''.<ref>Pilkington, Ed, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/04/colin-myler-new-york-daily-news \"Former NoW editor Colin Myler takes the helm at New York Daily News\"], ''The Guardian'', January 4, 2012.

{"title_page": "Elite capture", "text_new": "{{Underlinked|date=November 2018}}\n'''Elite capture''' is a form of [[corruption]] whereby public resources are [[Bias (disambiguation)|biased]] for the benefit of a few individuals of superior [[social status]] in detriment to the welfare of the larger population. Elites are groups of individuals who, because of self-ratifying factors such as social class, asset [[ownership]], religious affiliations, [[political power]], historic [[discrimination]] among social groups, political party affiliation, or economic position, have decision-making power in processes of public concern. This specific form of corruption occurs when elites use [[public funds]], originally intended to be invested in services that benefit the larger population, to fund projects that would only benefit them. This differentiates elite capture from [[embezzlement]], [[misappropriation]], or other diversion of funds by a [[Public Official|public official]]. Elite capture is related to [[information asymmetry]], inefficient regulation or inefficient allocation of resources because it causes a biased distribution of a public good or a service, resulting a situation wherein certain segments of the population experience reduced access to these public goods. In this context, as long as there is elite capture, the welfare impact will not be [[Pareto optimal|Pareto Optimal]] nor equitable.\n\n==Elite Capture in Decentralization==\nFor long it was thought that creating decentralized governments would avoid the limitations of a single planner in society. A [[centralized government]] often lacks knowledge and might be subject of [[Lobbying|lobbying]], leaving certain territories unattended. On the other hand, theory predicts that when people are involved in governing and have representation in decision making, public spending is supposed to be more efficient, more equitable and more sustainable. However, despite the theoretical predictions, the outcomes of many development projects in decentralized governments have not met these expectations.\nBy yielding power to smaller units, money should be more efficiently distributed, but local governments are more vulnerable to [[Pressure Groups|pressure groups]]. Failure can occur when particular subgroups of the community are able to mobilize resources to further their own self-interest at the expense of the broader community. Local governments are even more vulnerable to capture by local elites than national governments.\nAttempts to reduce elite capture in decentralized governments range from going back to a heavily centralized planner to providing citizens with funds to initiate projects. This last option has been criticized because the citizens\u2019 ability and skills to actually implement programs may be weaker than that of local leaders.  \nAccording to the [[World Bank]], development assistance is vulnerable to manipulation or hijack by elites, independently of the form that the assistance may take, because such aid it requires governmental or private agency to ensure transfer to households. It is in this intermediary stage where instances of elite capture are most common. Be it centralized or decentralized government, there is a risk of ineffective public resource delivery involved, where part of the local population will receive more than the rest of the local population. This situation has welfare consequences.\n\n==Alternative solutions==\nFirst, elite capture of public resources by local elites can be relatively lessened by the presence of media to balance the asymmetry of information. [[Empirical studies]] have shown that government responsiveness and accountability to ensure equal distribution of public goods and avoid elite capture is related to the availability of information and general levels of awareness among the local population.<ref>{{cite paper |work=Working Paper No. 2010/82 |title=Elite Capture or Capture Elites? Lessons from the 'Counter-elite' and 'Co-opt-elite' Approaches in Bangladesh and Ghana |first=Sam |last=Wong |date=July 2010 |url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/wp2010-82.pdf }}</ref> Second, the \u2018counter-elite\u2019 approach to deal with elite capture advocates challenging elites by completely excluding them in the implementation of projects. It assumes that all elites are inherently bad. By raising public awareness of power inequalities and building local capacity, this approach suggests that community empowerment and political citizenship would be effective in resisting elite domination. This approach is not necessarily effective in challenging elite domination, due to structural dependence of poor people on elites and the weakening of established institutions. Third, the \u2018co-opt-elite\u2019 approach suggests that cooperation with elites, rather than confrontation, is the solution to alleviating [[poverty]]. It asserts that not all elites are bad, and some of them can play a constructive role in community development. It also assumes a pragmatic use of elites\u2019 networks and resources can benefit poor communities.  The \u2018counter-elite\u2019 approach is not necessarily effective in eroding elite power, and also risks legitimizing the authority of the elites and worsening inequality.\n\n'''Similar Concepts'''\nElite capture and discrimination are very similar concepts because both imply unequal power status and denial of public resources. Social discrimination can promote elite capture, but is not an interchangeable concept. Elite capture is based on a state of an unequal power relations, whereas discrimination may or may not be the cause of an unequal distribution of power. Elite capture is a changing and dynamic process, and power structures change with it when a new elite arises. Discrimination is rather static in this sense. Elite capture is a manifested form of corruption, and social discrimination is a manifestation of a set of beliefs in a society. \nElite capture and state capture are also similar because they are both related to deviation of public resources for private benefits, but differ in how power is exercised. Elite capture is carried out by an elite that is legitimately entitled some level of de jure power. State capture is carried out by elites that exercise de facto power (e.g. powerful unions or big multinational companies) that aim to have influence on the decision making process of the institutions. However, both phenomena are both symptomatic of and a main reason for bad governance because they promote a vicious cycle, with long-term effects on institutional and bureaucratic performance.\n\n==Examples==\n \nAn example of elite capture in the United States is to be found in the literature on the subject of iron triangles, wherein special interests are able to achieve disproportionately favorable outcomes from  congressional committees and federal regulators. Oftentimes, personnel between each side of the iron triangle is interchangeable, a revolving door dynamic which is favorable to the development of capture of regulators by the entities they are supposed to oversee. \nAlso, examples are found in most developing countries, where an increasing proportion of government and foreign aid is distributed through community driven development but fail to properly reach the target population. \nAdditional examples are male-dominated cultures where women may be disproportionately influenced by elite capture, since they tend to be excluded from the social elect and public services.\nIt is a phenomenon that may even take place even where there is no clear indicators of \u2018capture\u2019 of power or corruption like access to education in rural areas of developing countries. While there are primary schools in the villages, they are somewhat dysfunctional due to lack of maintenance. As a result, children have to go to neighboring villages to study. Usually girls are not sent far away from their villages, limiting their study years. Therefore, girls are systematically denied access to a public resource (education) as opposed to boys in the same village. \nThe absence of an enabling social, political and economic environment can also encourage unintended elite capture. But at the same time, corruption and inefficiency appear to be a concomitant part of the elite capture problem.\n==Academic Approaches==\nAs with many other activities related to corruption, there has been very few systematic attempts to measure and identify causes and consequences of this phenomenon in the economy. The concept itself is still in constant evolution because a majority of the evidence comes from non-experimental case studies or empirical data sets where there is very little consensus on the outcomes. \nA formal representation of the level of elite capture could be done by considering a single public service and measuring how the elite capture changes its own per-capita enjoyment as compared if it were equitably distributed. The idea is to consider how different the average consumption level of a certain public program would be if the average formal elites were eliminated. Empirical studies often analyze total welfare and utility function of a society. The idea is to identifying utility function of all households in three scenarios: current unequal distribution situation, with probability of equitable distributions and unavailability the public service or good to finally compare the data.\n\nI like turtles.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Discrimination]]\n* [[Elite theory]]\n* [[Iron triangle (US politics)]]\n* [[Land reform]]\n* [[Regulatory capture]]\n* [[State capture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dutta|first1=Diya|title=Elite Capture and Corruption: Concepts and definitions|url=https://www.academia.edu/237917|language=en}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roopanarine|first1=Les|title=Development jargon decoded: Elite capture {{!}} Les Roopanarine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/13/development-jargon-decoded-elite-capture|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|date=13 November 2013}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gangadharan|first1=Lata|last2=Jain|first2=Tarun|last3=Maitra|first3=Pushkar|last4=Vecci|first4=Joseph|title=The Behavioural Response to Women's Empowerment Programs|url=https://www.theigc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gangadharan-et-al-2014-Working-Paper-1.pdf|publisher=IGC-Bihar}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/Colombia/ipc/20121206123000/corrupcion.pdf \n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/8567}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/8909/Musgrave_2016_JSustainableDev_CCBY_FinalPublishedVersion.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tse-fr.eu/sites/default/files/medias/stories/SEMIN_09_10/DEVELOPPEMENT/zhuravskaya.pdf}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51cdc7e5e4b0d7474642bcb0/t/57ea8f42893fc08c39ee737b/1474989890903/Mattingly_Informal_Institutions.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10745-016-9837-6.pdf|doi=10.1007/s10745-016-9837-6|pmid=27445426|pmc=4937088|title=Elite Capture and Corruption in two Villages in Bengkulu Province, Sumatra|journal=Human Ecology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=287\u2013300|year=2016|last1=Lucas|first1=Anton}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3859431-World-Bank-Study-Elite-Capture.html|title=World Bank Study Elite Capture}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/wp2010-82.pdf}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/final_power_double_page_spread_march_2012.pdf}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-pacitti/the-elite-capture-of-poli_b_13710494.html|title=The Elite Capture of Politics|date=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Category:Elite theory]]\n[[Category:Criticisms of welfare]]\n[[Category:Political corruption]]\n", "text_old": "{{Underlinked|date=November 2018}}\n'''Elite capture''' is a form of [[corruption]] whereby public resources are [[Bias (disambiguation)|biased]] for the benefit of a few individuals of superior [[social status]] in detriment to the welfare of the larger population.

These studies showed that specific, high (hard) goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goals or vague, abstract goals such as the exhortation to 'do one's best'. So long as a person is committed to the goal, has the requisite ability to attain it, and does not have conflicting goals, there is a positive, linear relationship between goal difficulty and task performance. Because goals refer to future valued outcomes, the setting of goals is first and foremost a discrepancy-creating process. It implies discontent with one's present condition and the desire to attain an object or outcome. |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237602737|citeseerx=10.1.1.553.1396 }}</ref>\n\nThe theory states that the simplest most direct motivational explanation of why some people perform better than others is because they have different performance goals. The essence of the theory is fourfold. First, difficult specific goals lead to significantly higher performance than easy goals, no goals, or even the setting of an abstract goal such as urging people to do their best. Second, holding ability constant, as this is a theory of motivation, and given that there is goal commitment, the higher the goal the higher the performance. Third, variables such as praise, feedback, or the involvement of people in decision-making only influences behavior to the extent that it leads to the setting of and commitment to a specific difficult goal. Fourth, goal-setting, in addition to affecting the three mechanisms of motivation, namely, choice, effort, and persistence, can also have a cognitive benefit. It can influence choice, effort, and persistence to discover ways to attain the goal.<ref>Latham, G. P. (2012). \"Motivate employee performance through goal-setting\". In Locke, E. Ed.

Through an understanding of the effect of goal setting on individual performance, organizations are able to use goal setting to benefit organizational performance. <ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\"/> In addition, another aspect that goes with goal commitment is also goal acceptance. This is an individuals willingness to pursue their specific goal. <ref name=\":0\" /> Locke and Latham (2002) have indicated three moderators that indicate goal setting success:\n\n{{numbered list\n|\nThe importance of the expected outcomes of goal attainment,\n|\nSelf-efficacy: one's belief that they are able to achieve the goals,\n|\nCommitment to others: promises or engagements to others can strongly improve commitment.\n}}\n\nExpanding the three from above, the level of commitment is influenced by external factors. Such as the person assigning the goal, setting the standard for the person to achieve/perform. This influences the level of commitment by how compliant the individual is with the one assigning the goal. An external factor can also be the role models of the individual. For example, say an individual looks up to their manager and cares about his or her opinion, the individual is more likely to listen to goal-setting strategies from that individual, and ultimately become more committed to their desired goal. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInternal factors can derive from their participation level in the work to achieve the goal. What they expect from themselves can either flourish their success, or destroy it. Also, the individual may want to appear superior to their peers or competitors. They want to achieve the goal the best and be known for it. The self-reward of accomplishing a goal, is usually one of the main keys that keep individuals committed. For example, if an individual was working toward becoming the president of their company, if they achieve their goal, they could reward themselves with something of importance to them. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother route individuals can take to set their goals is to follow (STD) that is, setting their goals to be Specific, Time-bound, and difficult.  Specifically, an individuals goal should be set at the 90th percentile of difficulty. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Goal\u2013performance relationship===\n\nLocke and colleagues (1981) examined the behavioral effects of goal-setting, concluding that 90% of laboratory and field studies involving specific and challenging goals led to higher performance than did easy or no goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Karyll N. |last3=Saari |first3=Lise M. |last4=Latham |first4=Gary P. |date=1981 |title=Goal setting and task performance: 1969\u20131980 |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=125\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.125}}</ref> This is because if an individual is intrinsically motivated by a goal, he or she will want to conquer the goal to receive internal rewards, and will be satisfied because of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLocke and Latham (2006) argue that it is not sufficient to urge employees to \"do their best\". \"Doing one's best\" has no external referent, which makes it useless in eliciting specific behavior. To elicit some specific form of behavior from another person, it is important that this person has a clear view of what is expected from him/her. A goal is thereby of vital importance because it helps an individual to focus his or her efforts in a specified direction. In other words, goals canalize behavior.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> (However, when faced with complex tasks and directions that are difficult to specify, telling someone to \"do their best\", with a focus on learning, can sometimes lead to the discovery of better strategies whereby specific goals can then be set.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>{{rp|707}})\n\n===Feedback===\n\nGoal setting can lead to creation of [[feedback]] loops, either negative or positive comparison of the output to the goal. Negative feedback loops lead to increasing the input associated with goal attainment to improve output in the next loop cycle. Positive feedback loops if not sufficiently reinforced can lead to subsequent setting of goals at a less difficult level.\n\nWithout proper feedback channels it is impossible for employees to adapt or adjust to the required behavior. Managers should keep track of performance to allow employees to see how effective they have been in attaining their goals.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Skinner |editor1-first=Natalie |editor2-last=Roche |editor2-first=Ann M. |editor3-last=O'Connor |editor3-first=John |editor4-last=Pollard |editor4-first=Yvette |editor5-last=Todd |editor5-first=Chelsea |title=Workforce development TIPS (theory into practice strategies): a resource kit for the alcohol and other drugs field |chapter=Goal setting |location=Adelaide |publisher=Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation (AER); National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (Australia) |year=2005 |pages=8\u20139 |isbn=978-1876897062 |oclc=156766716 |chapterurl=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/index.php/download_file/-/view/58 |url=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/workforce/publications_and_resources/nceta-workforce-development-resources/workforce_developemt_tips/}}</ref> Providing feedback on short-term objectives helps to sustain motivation and commitment to the goal.

These success factors are interdependent. For example, the expected outcomes of goals are positively influenced when employees are involved in the goal setting process. Not only does participation increase commitment in attaining the goals that are set, participation influences self-efficacy as well. Additionally, feedback is necessary to monitor one's progress. When feedback is not present, an employee might think (s)he is not making enough progress. This can reduce [[self-efficacy]] and thereby harm the performance outcomes in the long run.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bandura |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Bandura |date=March 1993 |title=Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013148 |doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/bandura/pajares/Bandura1993EP.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{unordered list\n|\nGoal-commitment, the most influential moderator,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} becomes especially important when dealing with difficult or complex goals. If people lack [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to goals, they lack motivation to reach them. To commit to a goal, one must believe in its importance or significance.\n|\nAttainability: individuals must also believe that they can attain\u2014or at least partially reach\u2014a defined goal. If they think no chance exists of reaching a goal, they may not even try.\n|\n[[Self-efficacy]]: the higher someone's self-efficacy regarding a certain task, the more likely they will set higher goals, and the more persistence they will show in achieving them.<ref>Goal-setting theory might define ''self-efficacy'' as an impression that one has the capability of performing in a certain manner or of attaining certain goals. Or one could define self-efficacy as a belief that one has the capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to [[Management|manage]] prospective situations. Unlike [[efficacy]] (defined as the power to produce an effect\u2014in essence, [[Skill|competence]]), self-efficacy consists of the belief (whether or not accurate) that one has the [[Power (sociology)|power]] to produce that effect. For example, a person with high self-efficacy may engage in more health-related activity when an illness occurs, whereas a person with low self efficacy may succumb to feelings of hopelessness. (Compare: {{cite book |last1=Sue |first1=David |last2=Sue |first2=Derald Wing |last3=Sue |first3=Stanley |last4=Sue |first4=Diane |title=Understanding abnormal behavior |year=2015 |edition=11th |page=194 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning |isbn=9781305537606 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6CaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT224}}) Note the distinction between [[self-esteem]] and self-efficacy. Self-esteem in this context relates to a person's sense of [[self-worth]], whereas self-efficacy relates to a person's perception of their ability to reach a goal. For example, take the case of an incompetent rock-climber. Though probably afflicted with poor self-efficacy in regard to rock climbing, this hypothetical person could retain their self-esteem unaffected.</ref>\n}}\n\n==In business==\nIn business, goal setting encourages participants to put in substantial effort. Also, because every member has defined expectations for their role, little room is left for inadequate, marginal effort to go unnoticed.\n\nManagers cannot constantly drive [[motivation]], or keep track of an employee's work on a continuous basis.

An example of a learning goal in executive or workplace coaching might be 'learn how to be the best lawyer in my area of practice'. Learning goals tend to be associated with a range of positive cognitive and emotional processes including perception of a complex task as a positive challenge rather than a threat, greater absorption in the actual task performance (Deci & Ryan, 2002), and enhanced memory and well-being (Linnenbrink, Ryan & Pintrich, 1999). Furthermore, individual performance can be enhanced in highly complex or challenging situations when team goals are primarily framed as being learning goals, and the use of team-level learning goals can foster enhanced co-operation between team members (Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001). One benefit of setting learning goals is that they tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic motivation which in turn is associated with performance (Sarrazin et al., 2002). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080651/http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"KeganLearningGoals\">{{cite book |last1=Kegan |first1=Robert |authorlink1=Robert Kegan |last2=Congleton |first2=Christina |last3=David |first3=Susan A |year=2013 |chapter=The goals behind the goals: pursuing adult development in the coaching enterprise |editor1-last=David |editor1-first=Susan A |editor2-last=Clutterbuck |editor2-first=David |editor3-last=Megginson |editor3-first=David |title=Beyond goals: effective strategies for coaching and mentoring |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Gower Publishing Limited |pages=229\u2013244 |isbn=9781409418511 |oclc=828416668}}</ref>\n\n==Developments in theory==\n===Goal choice===\nSelf-efficacy, past performance, and various other social factors influence goal setting.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> Failure to meet previous goals often leads to setting lower (and more likely achievable) goals.\n\n===Learning goals===\nThere are times when having specific goals is not a best option; this is the case when the goal requires new skills or knowledge. [[Tunnel vision]] is a consequence of specific goals; if a person is too focused on attaining a specific goal, he or she may ignore the need to learn new skills or acquire new information. This concept is illustrated well by the \"basketball game task\" study in which observers watched a video of a group of people wearing white shirts and black shirts who are passing a basketball back and forth, and the observers were instructed to count the number of times a basketball is passed between only the players wearing white shirts. During the video, a woman carrying an open umbrella walks across the screen. Of 28 observers who were focused on counting the number of passes between only the players wearing white shirts, only 6 reported noticing the woman carrying the umbrella. When observers watched the video without focusing on a specific task, all of the observers noticed the umbrella woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drjoebio.com/uploads/1/8/1/3/1813500/gorrila_in_our_midst.pdf|title=Gorillas in our Midst|last=Simons & Chabris|date=1999|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> In situations where the risk of tunnel vision is high, the best option is to set a ''learning goal''.

So long as a person is committed to the goal, has the requisite ability to attain it, and does not have conflicting goals, there is a positive, linear relationship between goal difficulty and task performance. Because goals refer to future valued outcomes, the setting of goals is first and foremost a discrepancy-creating process.

The essence of the theory is fourfold. First, difficult specific goals lead to significantly higher performance than easy goals, no goals, or even the setting of an abstract goal such as urging people to do their best. Second, holding ability constant, as this is a theory of motivation, and given that there is goal commitment, the higher the goal the higher the performance. Third, variables such as praise, feedback, or the involvement of people in decision-making only influences behavior to the extent that it leads to the setting of and commitment to a specific difficult goal. Fourth, goal-setting, in addition to affecting the three mechanisms of motivation, namely, choice, effort, and persistence, can also have a cognitive benefit. It can influence choice, effort, and persistence to discover ways to attain the goal.<ref>Latham, G. P. (2012). \"Motivate employee performance through goal-setting\". In Locke, E. Ed.

Through an understanding of the effect of goal setting on individual performance, organizations are able to use goal setting to benefit organizational performance. <ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\"/> In addition, another aspect that goes with goal commitment is also goal acceptance. This is an individuals willingness to pursue their specific goal. <ref name=\":0\" /> Locke and Latham (2002) have indicated three moderators that indicate goal setting success:\n\n{{numbered list\n|\nThe importance of the expected outcomes of goal attainment,\n|\nSelf-efficacy: one's belief that they are able to achieve the goals,\n|\nCommitment to others: promises or engagements to others can strongly improve commitment.\n}}\n\nExpanding the three from above, the level of commitment is influenced by external factors. Such as the person assigning the goal, setting the standard for the person to achieve/perform. This influences the level of commitment by how compliant the individual is with the one assigning the goal. An external factor can also be the role models of the individual. For example, say an individual looks up to their manager and cares about his or her opinion, the individual is more likely to listen to goal-setting strategies from that individual, and ultimately become more committed to their desired goal. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInternal factors can derive from their participation level in the work to achieve the goal. What they expect from themselves can either flourish their success, or destroy it. Also, the individual may want to appear superior to their peers or competitors. They want to achieve the goal the best and be known for it. The self-reward of accomplishing a goal, is usually one of the main keys that keep individuals committed. For example, if an individual was working toward becoming the president of their company, if they achieve their goal, they could reward themselves with something of importance to them. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother route individuals can take to set their goals is so follow (STD) that is, setting their goals to be Specific, Time-bound, and difficult.  Specifically, an individuals goal should be set at the 90th percentile of difficulty. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Goal\u2013performance relationship===\n\nLocke and colleagues (1981) examined the behavioral effects of goal-setting, concluding that 90% of laboratory and field studies involving specific and challenging goals led to higher performance than did easy or no goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Karyll N. |last3=Saari |first3=Lise M. |last4=Latham |first4=Gary P. |date=1981 |title=Goal setting and task performance: 1969\u20131980 |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=125\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.125}}</ref> This is because if an individual is intrinsically motivated by a goal, he or she will want to conquer the goal to receive internal rewards, and will be satisfied because of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLocke and Latham (2006) argue that it is not sufficient to urge employees to \"do their best\". \"Doing one's best\" has no external referent, which makes it useless in eliciting specific behavior. To elicit some specific form of behavior from another person, it is important that this person has a clear view of what is expected from him/her. A goal is thereby of vital importance because it helps an individual to focus his or her efforts in a specified direction. In other words, goals canalize behavior.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> (However, when faced with complex tasks and directions that are difficult to specify, telling someone to \"do their best\", with a focus on learning, can sometimes lead to the discovery of better strategies whereby specific goals can then be set.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>{{rp|707}})\n\n===Feedback===\n\nGoal setting can lead to creation of [[feedback]] loops, either negative or positive comparison of the output to the goal. Negative feedback loops lead to increasing the input associated with goal attainment to improve output in the next loop cycle. Positive feedback loops if not sufficiently reinforced can lead to subsequent setting of goals at a less difficult level.\n\nWithout proper feedback channels it is impossible for employees to adapt or adjust to the required behavior. Managers should keep track of performance to allow employees to see how effective they have been in attaining their goals.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Skinner |editor1-first=Natalie |editor2-last=Roche |editor2-first=Ann M. |editor3-last=O'Connor |editor3-first=John |editor4-last=Pollard |editor4-first=Yvette |editor5-last=Todd |editor5-first=Chelsea |title=Workforce development TIPS (theory into practice strategies): a resource kit for the alcohol and other drugs field |chapter=Goal setting |location=Adelaide |publisher=Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation (AER); National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (Australia) |year=2005 |pages=8\u20139 |isbn=978-1876897062 |oclc=156766716 |chapterurl=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/index.php/download_file/-/view/58 |url=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/workforce/publications_and_resources/nceta-workforce-development-resources/workforce_developemt_tips/}}</ref> Providing feedback on short-term objectives helps to sustain motivation and commitment to the goal.

These success factors are interdependent. For example, the expected outcomes of goals are positively influenced when employees are involved in the goal setting process. Not only does participation increase commitment in attaining the goals that are set, participation influences self-efficacy as well. Additionally, feedback is necessary to monitor one's progress. When feedback is not present, an employee might think (s)he is not making enough progress. This can reduce [[self-efficacy]] and thereby harm the performance outcomes in the long run.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bandura |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Bandura |date=March 1993 |title=Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013148 |doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/bandura/pajares/Bandura1993EP.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{unordered list\n|\nGoal-commitment, the most influential moderator,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} becomes especially important when dealing with difficult or complex goals. If people lack [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to goals, they lack motivation to reach them. To commit to a goal, one must believe in its importance or significance.\n|\nAttainability: individuals must also believe that they can attain\u2014or at least partially reach\u2014a defined goal. If they think no chance exists of reaching a goal, they may not even try.\n|\n[[Self-efficacy]]: the higher someone's self-efficacy regarding a certain task, the more likely they will set higher goals, and the more persistence they will show in achieving them.<ref>Goal-setting theory might define ''self-efficacy'' as an impression that one has the capability of performing in a certain manner or of attaining certain goals. Or one could define self-efficacy as a belief that one has the capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to [[Management|manage]] prospective situations. Unlike [[efficacy]] (defined as the power to produce an effect\u2014in essence, [[Skill|competence]]), self-efficacy consists of the belief (whether or not accurate) that one has the [[Power (sociology)|power]] to produce that effect. For example, a person with high self-efficacy may engage in more health-related activity when an illness occurs, whereas a person with low self efficacy may succumb to feelings of hopelessness. (Compare: {{cite book |last1=Sue |first1=David |last2=Sue |first2=Derald Wing |last3=Sue |first3=Stanley |last4=Sue |first4=Diane |title=Understanding abnormal behavior |year=2015 |edition=11th |page=194 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning |isbn=9781305537606 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6CaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT224}}) Note the distinction between [[self-esteem]] and self-efficacy. Self-esteem in this context relates to a person's sense of [[self-worth]], whereas self-efficacy relates to a person's perception of their ability to reach a goal. For example, take the case of an incompetent rock-climber. Though probably afflicted with poor self-efficacy in regard to rock climbing, this hypothetical person could retain their self-esteem unaffected.</ref>\n}}\n\n==In business==\nIn business, goal setting encourages participants to put in substantial effort. Also, because every member has defined expectations for their role, little room is left for inadequate, marginal effort to go unnoticed.\n\nManagers cannot constantly drive [[motivation]], or keep track of an employee's work on a continuous basis. Goals are therefore an important tool for managers, since goals have the ability to function as a self-regulatory mechanism that helps employees prioritize tasks.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A.

Learning goals tend to be associated with a range of positive cognitive and emotional processes including perception of a complex task as a positive challenge rather than a threat, greater absorption in the actual task performance (Deci & Ryan, 2002), and enhanced memory and well-being (Linnenbrink, Ryan & Pintrich, 1999). Furthermore, individual performance can be enhanced in highly complex or challenging situations when team goals are primarily framed as being learning goals, and the use of team-level learning goals can foster enhanced co-operation between team members (Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001). One benefit of setting learning goals is that they tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic motivation which in turn is associated with performance (Sarrazin et al., 2002). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080651/http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"KeganLearningGoals\">{{cite book |last1=Kegan |first1=Robert |authorlink1=Robert Kegan |last2=Congleton |first2=Christina |last3=David |first3=Susan A |year=2013 |chapter=The goals behind the goals: pursuing adult development in the coaching enterprise |editor1-last=David |editor1-first=Susan A |editor2-last=Clutterbuck |editor2-first=David |editor3-last=Megginson |editor3-first=David |title=Beyond goals: effective strategies for coaching and mentoring |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Gower Publishing Limited |pages=229\u2013244 |isbn=9781409418511 |oclc=828416668}}</ref>\n\n==Developments in theory==\n===Goal choice===\nSelf-efficacy, past performance, and various other social factors influence goal setting.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> Failure to meet previous goals often leads to setting lower (and more likely achievable) goals.\n\n===Learning goals===\nThere are times when having specific goals is not a best option; this is the case when the goal requires new skills or knowledge. [[Tunnel vision]] is a consequence of specific goals; if a person is too focused on attaining a specific goal, he or she may ignore the need to learn new skills or acquire new information. This concept is illustrated well by the \"basketball game task\" study in which observers watched a video of a group of people wearing white shirts and black shirts who are passing a basketball back and forth, and the observers were instructed to count the number of times a basketball is passed between only the players wearing white shirts. During the video, a woman carrying an open umbrella walks across the screen. Of 28 observers who were focused on counting the number of passes between only the players wearing white shirts, only 6 reported noticing the woman carrying the umbrella. When observers watched the video without focusing on a specific task, all of the observers noticed the umbrella woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drjoebio.com/uploads/1/8/1/3/1813500/gorrila_in_our_midst.pdf|title=Gorillas in our Midst|last=Simons & Chabris|date=1999|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> In situations where the risk of tunnel vision is high, the best option is to set a ''learning goal''. A learning goal is a generalized goal to achieve knowledge in a certain topic or field, but it can ultimately lead to better performance in specific goals related to the learning goals.<ref name=\"GrantLearningGoals\"/><ref name=\"KeganLearningGoals\"/>\n\nLocke and Latham (2006) attribute this response to [[metacognition]]. They believe that \"a learning goal facilitates or enhances metacognition\u2014namely, planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress toward goal attainment\".<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> This is necessary in environments with little or no guidance and structure. Although jobs typically have set goals, individual goals and achievement can benefit from metacognition.\n\n===Framing===\n[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], or how goals are viewed, influences performance. When one feels threatened and or intimidated by a high goal they perform poorer than those who view the goal as a challenge.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> The framing of a goal as a gain or a loss influences one's eventual performance.\n\n===Affect===\nRealization of goals has an effect on [[Affect (psychology)|affect]]\u2014that is, feelings of success and satisfaction. Achieving goals has a positive effect, and failing to meet goals has negative consequences.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> However, the effect of goals is not exclusive to one realm. Success in one's job can compensate for feelings of failure in one's personal life.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>\n\n===Group goals===\nThe relationship between group goals and individual goals influences group performance; when goals are compatible there is a positive effect, but when goals are incompatible the effects can be detrimental to the group's performance.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> There is another factor at work in groups, and that is the sharing factor; a positive correlation exists between sharing information within the group and group performance.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> In the case of group goals, feedback needs to be related to the group, not individuals, in order for it to improve the group's performance.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>\n\nGoal concordance (agreement) among members of groups as well as concordance across hierarchies in organizations has positive performance impacts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vancouver|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Schmitt|first2=Neal W.|date=2006-12-07|title=An exploratory examination of person\u2013organization fit: organizational goal congruence|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=333\u2013352|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb00962.x|issn=0031-5826}}</ref> Research evaluating affects of goals on employee commitment found an indirect relationship mediated by employee perception of organizational support, suggesting that leaders to directly support goal setting by individual employees.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hutchison|first=Steven|last2=Garstka|first2=Mary L.|date=August 1996|title=Sources of perceived organizational support: goal setting and feedback|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=26|issue=15|pages=1351\u20131366|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1996.tb00075.x|issn=0021-9029}}</ref>\n\n===Goals and traits===\nOn a basic level, the two types of goals are ''learning goals'' and ''performance goals''; each possesses different traits associated with the selected goal.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/><ref name=\"GrantLearningGoals\"/>\n\n''Learning goals'' involve tasks where skills and knowledge can be acquired, whereas ''performance goals'' involve easy-to-accomplish tasks that will make one appear successful (thus tasks where error and judgment may be possible are avoided).\n\nA more complex trait-mediation study is the one conducted by Lee, Sheldon, and Turban (2003),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Felissa K. |last2=Sheldon |first2=Kennon M. |last3=Turban |first3=Daniel B. |title=Personality and the goal-striving process: the influence of achievement goal patterns, goal level, and mental focus on performance and enjoyment |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |date=April 2003 |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=256\u2013265 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.256 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10773182 |pmid=12731709}}</ref> which yielded the following results:\n\n*''Amotivated orientation'' (low confidence in one's capabilities) is associated with goal-avoidance motivation, and more generally, associated with lower goals levels and lower performance.\n*''Control orientation'' (extrinsic motivation) is associated with both avoidance and approach goals. Approach goals are associated with higher goal levels and higher performance.\n*''Autonomy goals'' (intrinsic motivation) leads to mastery goals, enhanced focus, and therefore enhanced performance.\n\n===Macro-level goals===\n''Macro-level goals'' refer to goal setting that is applied to the company as a whole.

They announced much of their output would be follow-ups to films that had done well at the box office theatrically, but wouldn't be expected to do well if a sequel were to be made. The first release under the Warner Premiere banner was the prequel film ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning]]''. Their second title release was a sequel to the 1999 horror film ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' titled ''[[Return to House on Haunted Hill]]''. In addition to the live-action output, the label was used for several direct-to-video animated films from Warner's corporate siblings such as [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. \n\nThe label released ''[[Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd: Out of Control]]'' \u2013 a spin-off of the 2008 film ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' \u2013 on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] July 1, 2008. The film follows the adventures of the two tech experts from the first film played by [[Masi Oka]] and [[Nate Torrence]], respectively. It was also written by the two writers of the previous film.<ref>[http://www.collider.com/dvd/news/article.asp?aid=8069&tcid=3 Get Smart's BRUCE AND LLOYD Out of Control Trailer and Behind the Scenes Footage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1018723/ Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control (2008)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Later years (2008\u20132013)===\nOn July 29, 2008, Warner Premiere released ''[[Lost Boys: The Tribe]]'', a sequel to the 1987 horror film ''[[The Lost Boys]]'', on [[DVD]] and Blu-ray. [[Corey Feldman]] reprised his role of vampire hunter Edgar Frog; [[Corey Haim]] appeared in a cameo. In September 2008, Warner Premiere released the direct-to-DVD sequel of [[Hilary Duff]]'s hit film ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' titled ''[[Another Cinderella Story]]'', starring [[Selena Gomez]]. After the [[2009 Sundance Film Festival]], Warner Bros. announced through Warner Premiere that the film ''[[Spring Breakdown]]'' would be released straight-to-DVD on April 9 according to Home Media Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homemediamagazine.com/news/studios-acquire-titles-sundance-14443|title=Studios Acquire Titles at Sundance|author=Billy Gil}}</ref>\n\nA sub-label of Warner Premiere was [[Raw Feed]], which released horror/thriller films and Warner Premiere Digital, which released original internet projects.\n\nDue to growing economic uncertainty and being a huge slump on the DVD market, Warner Bros. announced in 2012 that it had shut down Warner Premiere after six years of operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/warner-premiere-getting-shut-down-51791|title=Warner Bros.

They announced much of their output would be follow-ups to films that had done well at the box office theatrically, but wouldn't be expected to do well if a sequel were to be made. The first release under the Warner Premiere banner was the prequel film ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning]]''. Their second title release was a sequel to the 1999 horror film ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' titled ''[[Return to House on Haunted Hill]]''. In addition to the live-action output, the label was used for several direct-to-video animated films from Warner's corporate siblings such as [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. \n\nThe label released ''[[Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd: Out of Control]]'' \u2013 a spin-off of the 2008 film ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' \u2013 on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] July 1, 2008. The film follows the adventures of the two tech experts from the first film played by [[Masi Oka]] and [[Nate Torrence]], respectively. It was also written by the two writers of the previous film.<ref>[http://www.collider.com/dvd/news/article.asp?aid=8069&tcid=3 Get Smart\u2019s BRUCE AND LLOYD Out of Control Trailer and Behind the Scenes Footage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1018723/ Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control (2008)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Later years (2008\u20132013)===\nOn July 29, 2008, Warner Premiere released ''[[Lost Boys: The Tribe]]'', a sequel to the 1987 horror film ''[[The Lost Boys]]'', on [[DVD]] and Blu-ray. [[Corey Feldman]] reprised his role of vampire hunter Edgar Frog; [[Corey Haim]] appeared in a cameo. In September 2008, Warner Premiere released the direct-to-DVD sequel of [[Hilary Duff]]'s hit film ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' titled ''[[Another Cinderella Story]]'', starring [[Selena Gomez]]. After the [[2009 Sundance Film Festival]], Warner Bros. announced through Warner Premiere that the film ''[[Spring Breakdown]]'' would be released straight-to-DVD on April 9 according to Home Media Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homemediamagazine.com/news/studios-acquire-titles-sundance-14443|title=Studios Acquire Titles at Sundance|author=Billy Gil}}</ref>\n\nA sub-label of Warner Premiere was [[Raw Feed]], which released horror/thriller films and Warner Premiere Digital, which released original internet projects.\n\nDue to growing economic uncertainty and being a huge slump on the DVD market, Warner Bros. announced in 2012 that it had shut down Warner Premiere after six years of operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/warner-premiere-getting-shut-down-51791|title=Warner Bros.

In 2017, 8&nbsp;million passengers passed through the airport, making it [[Busiest airports in Malaysia|the second busiest airport in Malaysia]] after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]. A medium-sized airport with good connections to most major aviation hubs across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, the airport serves the city of Kota Kinabalu as well as the entire west coast of Sabah.\n\n==History==\nThe airport began as a [[Airbase|military airfield]] built by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"dca\" /> It was then known as '''Jesselton Airfield''' (Kota Kinabalu was known as Jesselton at the time). Towards the end of the war, it suffered severe bombings by [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Jul.45.html|title=USAAF Chronology:|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) of North Borneo (now Sabah) took over the operation and maintenance of the airport. In 1957, the original grass strip runway was resurfaced with [[bitumen]] material and a new terminal was built.<ref name=\"dca\">[http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205346/http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php|date=27 September 2007}}, ''Department of Civil Aviation, Sabah''. Accessed 10 April 2007.</ref> By 1959, the runway had been extended to 1,593 metres to enable the operation of [[Malayan Airways]]' turboprop [[Vickers Viscount|Viscount aircraft]]. In 1963, the runway was further reinforced and lengthened to 1,921 meters to cater for [[De Havilland Comet|Comet 4]] jet operations. Commercial flights and passenger arrivals gradually increased and a larger terminal building was needed. By 1967, [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] had begun operating a twice-weekly [[Convair 880]] jet service between the airport and Hong Kong with an intermediate stop in Manila.<ref>timetableimages.com, Cathay Pacific 16 April 1967 system timetable</ref>\n\nIn 1969, a British consultancy firm was appointed to formulate a Master Plan for a phased and organised development of KKIA over the next few decades. The master plan was submitted to the government with recommendations to:\n* reinforce and extend the runway to 2,987 metres to cater for [[Boeing 707]] and 747 jet operations\n* build a new terminal complex and parallel taxiway connecting to the runway\n* provide navigation equipment, communication facilities and a modern light system for the runway\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a new terminal building was built on the other side of the runway from the original terminal. Almost all commercial flights were shifted to this newer and larger terminal. Subsequently, the original terminal became known as the ''Airport Lama'' (\"Old Airport\"). In 1992, the DCA of Sabah was corporatised and [[Malaysia Airports|Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad]] took over the management and operations of the airport.<ref name=\"dca\" /> A further expansion project for both terminals began in 2006, and in January 2007 the original terminal was rebranded Terminal 2 whilst the newer terminal became known as Terminal 1.\n\nTerminal 2 was closed on 1 December 2015 and all airlines shifted their operations to Terminal 1.<ref name=\"T2close\">{{cite news |last=Sario|first=Ruben|date=30 November 2015|title=KKIA Terminal 2 to close from midnight|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/data/stories/2015/11/30/09/10/terminal-2-kkia/|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref> There are plans to use Terminal 2 for cargo operations and general aviation.<ref name=\"TheSun\">{{cite news |date=17 September 2015|title=Airasia must relocate from KKIA'S 'land-locked' terminal 2, says MAHB|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1555402|newspaper=The Sun Daily (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion and renovation==\nIn mid-2005, the Malaysian federal government approved major renovation and refurbishment works to the main terminal (Terminal 1) as well as a runway expansion project worth RM1.4&nbsp;billion.

International Airport''' ('''KKIA''') {{airport codes|BKI|WBKK}} is an [[international airport]] in [[Kota Kinabalu]], the state capital of [[Sabah]], Malaysia. It is located approximately {{Convert|8|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city centre. In 2017, 8&nbsp;million passengers passed through the airport, making it [[Busiest airports in Malaysia|the second busiest airport in Malaysia]] after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]. A medium-sized airport with good connections to most major aviation hubs across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, the airport serves the city of Kota Kinabalu as well as the entire west coast of Sabah.\n\n==History==\nThe airport began as a [[Airbase|military airfield]] built by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"dca\" /> It was then known as '''Jesselton Airfield''' (Kota Kinabalu was known as Jesselton at the time). Towards the end of the war, it suffered severe bombings by [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Jul.45.html|title=USAAF Chronology:|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) of North Borneo (now Sabah) took over the operation and maintenance of the airport. In 1957, the original grass strip runway was resurfaced with [[bitumen]] material and a new terminal was built.<ref name=\"dca\">[http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205346/http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php|date=27 September 2007}}, ''Department of Civil Aviation, Sabah''. Accessed 10 April 2007.</ref> By 1959, the runway had been extended to 1,593 metres to enable the operation of [[Malayan Airways]]' turboprop [[Vickers Viscount|Viscount aircraft]]. In 1963, the runway was further reinforced and lengthened to 1,921 meters to cater for [[De Havilland Comet|Comet 4]] jet operations. Commercial flights and passenger arrivals gradually increased and a larger terminal building was needed. By 1967, [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] had begun operating a twice-weekly [[Convair 880]] jet service between the airport and Hong Kong with an intermediate stop in Manila.<ref>timetableimages.com, Cathay Pacific 16 April 1967 system timetable</ref>\n\nIn 1969, a British consultancy firm was appointed to formulate a Master Plan for a phased and organised development of KKIA over the next few decades. The master plan was submitted to the government with recommendations to:\n* reinforce and extend the runway to 2,987 metres to cater for [[Boeing 707]] and 747 jet operations\n* build a new terminal complex and parallel taxiway connecting to the runway\n* provide navigation equipment, communication facilities and a modern light system for the runway\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a new terminal building was built on the other side of the runway from the original terminal. Almost all commercial flights were shifted to this newer and larger terminal. Subsequently, the original terminal became known as the ''Airport Lama'' (\"Old Airport\"). In 1992, the DCA of Sabah was corporatised and [[Malaysia Airports|Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad]] took over the management and operations of the airport.<ref name=\"dca\" /> A further expansion project for both terminals began in 2006, and in January 2007 the original terminal was rebranded Terminal 2 whilst the newer terminal became known as Terminal 1.\n\nTerminal 2 was closed on 1 December 2015 and all airlines shifted their operations to Terminal 1.<ref name=\"T2close\">{{cite news |last=Sario|first=Ruben|date=30 November 2015|title=KKIA Terminal 2 to close from midnight|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/data/stories/2015/11/30/09/10/terminal-2-kkia/|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref> There are plans to use Terminal 2 for cargo operations and general aviation.<ref name=\"TheSun\">{{cite news |date=17 September 2015|title=Airasia must relocate from KKIA'S 'land-locked' terminal 2, says MAHB|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1555402|newspaper=The Sun Daily (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion and renovation==\nIn mid-2005, the Malaysian federal government approved major renovation and refurbishment works to the main terminal (Terminal 1) as well as a runway expansion project worth RM1.4&nbsp;billion.

It can be accessed via Jalan Kepayan, Jalan Lintas and Jalan Putatan located in the suburb or township of [[Kepayan]]. The terminal is capable of handling 9&nbsp;million passengers per annum and is equipped with the following facilities:\n* 64 check-in counters for international and domestic flights\n* 2 baggage x-ray check-in machines and 5 hand luggage x-ray machines (3 for departures, 1 for VIPs and 1 for staff)\n* 36 immigration counters (16 for departures and 20 for arrivals)\n* 6 baggage carousels\n* 3 floors (Ground floor: arrival hall, first floor: airline offices and local departures, second floor: check-in counters and domestic/foreign departures)\n* 9 aerobridges\n* 17 aircraft parking bays capable of accommodating wide and narrow body aircraft\n* 1,400 car parking bays\n\nThe Departure Hall column head design is inspired by the 'Wakid' basket design. A 'Wakid' is, in Sabahan tradition, a symbol of preparing for a meaningful journey. Some ethnic patterns of the Rungus and Bajau ethnic groups are also incorporated into the design of the floor tiles.\n\nThe first flight to depart at the new wing was MH2637 to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur]] at 06:50 while the last flight at the old wing was at 00:25. [[Malaysia Airlines]] is the main operating airline in this terminal.<ref>[http://www.azworldairports.com/airports/p2030bki.htm Kota Kinabalu International Airport], ''A-Z World Airports Online''. Accessed 11 May 2007.</ref>\n\n===Terminal 2===\nTerminal 2 was the original terminal building of the airport when it was first built. It is accessed via Jalan Mat Salleh in [[Tanjung Aru]] and is located on the other side of the runway from Terminal 1. Terminal 2 served charter and low-cost carriers, the main airline utilizing the terminal being [[AirAsia]].\n\nIn 2006, Terminal 2 underwent a major renovation and extension to accommodate low-cost carriers, reopening on 1 January 2007 in conjunction with ''Visit Malaysia Year 2007''. The works were completed 27 months ahead of schedule. It had 26 check-in counters for domestic and international flights and 6 parking bays for B737 and A320 aircraft as well as 7 luggage x-ray machines, a VIP room and 13 immigration counters. The terminal had the capacity to handle 3&nbsp;million passengers annually.<ref name=\"LCC\" />\n\nHowever, with limited expansion space and the congestion at Terminal 2, as well as to consolidate all airlines operations in one terminal, airlines at Terminal 2 was ordered to move to Terminal 1.

His new master Calvin Smith, who according to Robinson, was cruel and unforgiving.  In 1813 General [[Andrew Jackson]] arrived to gather forces to repel the British during what would become the [[Battle of New Orleans]].  During an engagement several of Robinson's fingers were shot off in battle.  After the American victory, soldiers gathered around General [[Andrew Jackson]] and he announced that the slaves that had fought would not be freed after all.  Robinson thought about taking his gun and shooting General [[Andrew Jackson]] right then and there but decided against it.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Roberts, 1753-.

His new master Calvin Smith, who according to Robinson, was cruel and unforgiving.  In 1813 General [[Andrew Jackson]] arrived to gather forces to repel the British during what would become the [[Battle of New Orleans]].  During an engagement several of Robinson's fingers were shot off in battle.  After the American victory, soldiers gathered around General [[Andrew Jackson]] and he announced that the slaves that had fought would not be freed after all.  Robinson thought about taking his gun and shooting General [[Andrew Jackson]] right then and there but decided against it.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Roberts, 1753-.
