It is also used by [[Presbyterians]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is [[Trinity|trinitarian]] in structure with sections affirming belief in [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] and [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|God the Holy Spirit]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bayes|first=Jonathan F.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y5FMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=The+Apostles'+Creed+is+trinitarian+in+structure+with+sections+affirming+belief+in+God+the+Father,+God+the+Son+and+God+the+Holy+Spirit&source=bl&ots=LlEdVomgjC&sig=ACfU3U3ABZnPJmgUlY96f5f0SBV_Ak9Zgg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih9Puj0qnoAhXJMMAKHcB1BjoQ6AEwDXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Apostles'%20Creed%20is%20trinitarian%20in%20structure%20with%20sections%20affirming%20belief%20in%20God%20the%20Father,%20God%20the%20Son%20and%20God%20the%20Holy%20Spirit&f=false|title=The Apostles' Creed: Truth with Passion|date=2010-09-09|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60899-539-4|language=en}}</ref>. The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD&nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]. See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|Den apostolske trosbekendelse]].\n\n===United Methodist Church===\nThe [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services.

Nashville: The Methodist Publishing House. #738.</ref>\n\nHowever, when the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in the United States in 1784, John Wesley sent the new American Church a Sunday Service which included the phrase \"he descended into hell\" in the text of The Apostles' Creed.  <ref>Wesley, John (1784). \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with other Occasional Services,\" p. 12.</ref> It is clear that Wesley intended American Methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the Creed. \n\nThe ''United Methodist Hymnal'' of 1989 also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).<ref>{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.</ref> This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\n:I believe in God the Father Almighty,\n::maker of heaven and earth;\n\n:And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, \n::who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, \n::born of the Virgin Mary, \n::suffered under Pontius Pilate, \n::was crucified, died, and was buried;\n::he descended to the dead.\n::On the third day he rose again; \n::he ascended into heaven, \n::is seated at the right hand of the Father, \n::and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\n:I believe in the Holy Spirit,\n::the holy catholic church,\n::the communion of saints,\n::the forgiveness of sins,\n::the resurrection of the body \n::and the life everlasting.

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. The Apostles' Creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, \"Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Holy Baptism,\" The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> It is also used in an interrogative form at the [[Easter Vigil]] in The Renewal of Baptismal Vows.<ref>''The Book of Common Prayer'' (1979).

The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD&nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

In the fourth line, it replaced the personal pronoun \"he\" with the relative \"who\", and changed the punctuation, so as no longer to present the Creed as a series of separate statements. In the same line it removed the words \"the power of\". It explained its rationale for making these changes and for preserving other controverted expressions in the 1988 publication ''Praying Together'', with which it presented its new version:<ref>{{cite web|title=Praying Together|url=https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/a42fbdb2/files/uploaded/praying.pdf|publisher=English Language Liturgical Consultation|access-date=2 June 2019|page=22|date=1988}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|I believe in God, the Father almighty,\ncreator of heaven and earth.\nI believe in Jesus Christ, God's only Son, our Lord,\nwho was conceived by the Holy Spirit,\nborn of the Virgin Mary,\nsuffered under Pontius Pilate,\nwas crucified, died, and was buried;\nhe descended to the dead.\nOn the third day he rose again;\nhe ascended into heaven,\nhe is seated at the right hand of the Father,\nand he will come to judge the living and the dead.\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\nthe holy catholic Church,\nthe communion of saints,\nthe forgiveness of sins,\nthe resurrection of the body,\nand the life everlasting.

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism.

Initially, the large diocese covered the (modern) counties of [[Rogaland]], [[Aust-Agder]], and [[Vest-Agder]] as well as the regions of [[Valdres]] (in [[Oppland]] county), [[Hallingdal]] (in [[Buskerud]] county), and the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]] (in [[Hordaland]] county).  After the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Diocese of Stavanger continued in the new [[Church of Norway]].<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOver time, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city.

It covers all of [[Rogaland]] county in western [[Norway]]. The cathedral city is [[Stavanger]], where the [[Stavanger Cathedral]] is located.  The bishop is [[Ivar Braut]], who has held the post since 2017.\n\n==History==\nThe Diocese of Stavanger was established in the 12th century (either 1112 or maybe 1125) when it was separated from the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]]. Initially, the large diocese covered the (modern) counties of [[Rogaland]], [[Aust-Agder]], and [[Vest-Agder]] as well as the regions of [[Valdres]] (in [[Oppland]] county), [[Hallingdal]] (in [[Buskerud]] county), and the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]] (in [[Hordaland]] county).  After the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Diocese of Stavanger continued in the new [[Church of Norway]].<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOver time, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established Diocese of Stavanger and the cathedral in Stavanger regained its place as the seat of a bishop.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Bishops of Stavanger==\n\n===Catholic (12th century-Reformation)===\n{{Main|Ancient Diocese of Stavanger}}\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Reinald, Bishop of Stavanger|Reinald]] ca. 1112\u20131135\n* [[Jon Birgersson]], 1135\u20131152\n* [[Peter, Bishop of Stavanger|Peter]], 1152\u2013??\n* [[Amund, Bishop of Stavanger|Amund]], ??\u20131171\n* [[Eirik Ivarsson]], 1171\u20131188\n* [[Nj\u00e5l, Bishop of Stavanger|Nj\u00e5l]], 1189/90\u20131207\n* [[Henrik, Bishop of Stavanger|Henrik]], 1207\u20131224\n* [[Askell Jonsson]], 1226\u20131254\n* [[Torgils, Bishop of Stavanger|Torgils]], 1255\u20131276\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Arne, Bishop of Stavanger|Arne]], 1277\u20131303\n* [[Ketil, Bishop of Stavanger|Ketil]], 1304\u20131317\n* [[H\u00e5kon Halldorsson]], 1318\u20131322\n* [[Eirik Ogmundsson]], 1322\u20131342\n* [[Guttorm P\u00e5lsson]], 1343\u20131350\n* [[Sigfrid, Bishop of Stavanger|Sigfrid]], 1351\u20131352\n* [[Gyrd Aslason]], 1354\u20131355\n* [[Bottolf Asbj\u00f8rnsson]], 1355\u20131380\n* [[Hallgeirr Osmundsson]], 1380/81\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Olaf, Bishop of Stavanger|Olaf]], 1381/82\u20131398/1400\n* [[H\u00e5kon Ivarsson]], 1400\u20131426\n* [[Audun Eyvindsson]], 1427\u20131445\n* [[Gunnar Eriksson, Bishop of Stavanger|Gunnar Eriksson]], 1445\u20131451/53\n* [[Sigurd Bj\u00f8rnsson]], 1454\u20131463\n* [[Alv Thorgardsson]], 1464\u20131478\n* [[Eiliv Jonsson]], 1481\u20131512\n* [[Hoskuld Hoskuldsson]], 1513\u20131537\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Lutheran (Reformation\u20131682)===\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Jon Guttormsen]], 1541\u20131557\n* [[Jens Gregersen Riber]], 1558\u20131571\n* [[J\u00f8rgen Eriksen]], 1571\u20131604\n* [[Laurits Clausen Scabo]], 1605\u20131626\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Tomas Cortsen Wegner]], 1627\u20131654\n* [[Markus Christensen Humble]], 1655\u20131661\n* [[Christen Madsen Tausan]], 1661\u20131680\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Lutheran (1925\u2013present)===\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Jacob Christian Petersen]], 1925\u20131940\n* [[Gabriel Skagestad]], 1940\u20131949\n* [[Karl Martinussen]], 1949\u20131960\n* [[Fritjov S\u00f8iland Birkeli]], 1960\u20131968\n* [[Olav Hages\u00e6ther]], 1968\u20131976\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Sigurd Lunde (bishop)|Sigurd Lunde]], 1977\u20131986\n* [[Bj\u00f8rn Bue]], 1986\u20131997\n* [[Ernst Oddvar Baasland]], 1998\u20132009\n* [[Erling Johan Pettersen]], 2009\u20132016\n* [[Ivar Braut]], 2017-2019\n* [[Anne Lise \u00c5dn\u00f8y]] since 2019\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe Diocese of Stavanger is divided into nine [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}) spread out over the county.

{"title_page": "Theory of multiple intelligences", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}The '''theory of multiple intelligences''' differentiates [[human intelligence]] into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single [[general ability]]. [[Howard Gardner]] proposed this model in his 1983 book ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. According to the theory, an intelligence 'modality' must fulfill eight criteria:{{r|Gilman}}\n# potential for brain isolation by [[brain damage]]\n# place in [[evolutionary history]]\n# presence of core operations\n# susceptibility to encoding (symbolic expression)\n# a distinct developmental progression\n# the existence of [[savant syndrome|savant]]s, prodigies and other exceptional people\n# support from [[experimental psychology]]\n# support from [[psychometric]] findings\n\nGardner proposed eight abilities that he held to meet these criteria:<ref>Slavin, Robert (2009), ''Educational Psychology'', p. 117, {{ISBN|0-205-59200-7}}</ref> \n# musical-rhythmic,\n# [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|visual-spatial]],\n# [[linguistic intelligence|verbal-linguistic]],\n# logical-mathematical,\n# [[Physical Intelligence|bodily-kinesthetic]],\n# interpersonal,\n# intrapersonal,\n# naturalistic\n\nIn 2009, he suggested that [[Spiritual intelligence|existential]] and [[ethics|moral]] intelligences may also be worthy of inclusion.{{r|Smith}}\n\nAlthough the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labelling learners to a specific intelligence. Gardner maintains that his theory should \"empower learners\", not restrict them to one modality of learning.<ref>McKenzie, W. (2005). Multiple intelligences and instructional technology. ISTE (International Society for Technology Education). {{ISBN|156484188X}}</ref> According to Gardner, an intelligence is \"a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture.\"{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=33-4|ps=}} According to a 2006 study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}\n\n== Intelligence Modalities ==\n\n=== Musical-rhythmic and harmonic ===\n{{main|Musicality}}\n\nThis area has to do with sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, [[Pitch (music)|tones]], and music. People with a high musical intelligence normally have good pitch and may even have [[absolute pitch]], and are able to sing, play musical instruments, and compose music. They have sensitivity to rhythm, pitch, meter, tone, melody or timbre.{{r|PBS}}<ref name=G-H>{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H., & Hatch, T. |title=Multiple intelligences go to school: Educational implications of the theory of multiple intelligences|doi=10.3102/0013189X018008004|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jcnesbit/EDUC220/ThinkPaper/Gardner1989.pdf|year=1989|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|issue=8|page=4|last2=Hatch}}</ref>\n\n=== Visual-spatial ===\n{{main|Spatial intelligence (psychology)}}\n\nThis area deals with spatial judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind's eye. Spatial ability is one of the three factors beneath ''g'' in the hierarchical model of intelligence.<ref name=G-H />\n\n=== Verbal-linguistic ===\n{{main|Linguistic intelligence}}\n\nPeople with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with words and languages. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with dates.<ref name=G-H /> Verbal ability is one of the most ''g''-loaded abilities.<ref>Wechsler, D. (1997). [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] III.</ref>\nThis type of intelligence is measured with the [[Verbal IQ|Verbal IQ in WAIS-IV]].\n\n=== Logical-mathematical ===\n{{further|Reason}}\n\nThis area has to do with [[logic]], abstractions, reasoning, numbers and critical thinking.<ref name=G-H /> This also has to do with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system.{{r|PBS}} Logical reasoning is closely linked to [[fluid intelligence]] and to [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence (''g'' factor)]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=J.

Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.{{r|Heteroglossia}}\n\n=== Interpersonal ===\n{{main|Social skills}}\n\nIn theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group. According to Gardner in ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom'', \"Inter- and Intra- personal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people...\"<ref>Gardner, H. (1995). ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom\u2014Administrators' Version''. {{ISBN|1-887943-03-X}}.

This refers to having a deep understanding of the self; what one's strengths or weaknesses are, what makes one unique, being able to predict one's own reactions or emotions.\n\n=== Naturalistic ===\nNot part of Gardner's original seven, naturalistic intelligence was proposed by him in 1995. \"If I were to rewrite Frames of Mind today, I would probably add an eighth intelligence \u2013 the intelligence of the naturalist. It seems to me that the individual who is readily able to recognize flora and fauna, to make other consequential distinctions in the natural world, and to use this ability productively (in hunting, in farming, in biological science) is exercising an important intelligence and one that is not adequately encompassed in the current list.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H. |year=1995|title=Reflections on multiple intelligences: Myths and messages|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume= 77|pages= 200\u2013209|url=https://learnweb.harvard.edu/WIDE/courses/files/Reflections.pdf}}</ref> This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings.<ref name=G-H /> Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types. This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters, gatherers]], and [[farmer]]s; it continues to be central in such roles as [[botanist]] or [[chef]].{{r|PBS}}\n\nThis sort of ecological receptiveness is deeply rooted in a \"sensitive, [[Ethics|ethical]], and [[Holism|holistic]] understanding\" of the world and its complexities \u2013 including the role of humanity within the greater ecosphere.<ref>{{cite book|author = Morris, M.|editor = Kincheloe, Joe L.|chapter = Ch. 8.

Check minutes 5:00 \u2013 5:55 and 8:16</ref> In the same interview, he explicitly refused some other suggested intelligences like humour, cooking and sexual intelligence.<ref name=\"Gard16\"/> Professor Nan B. Adams (2004) argues that based on Gardner's definition of Multiple Intelligences, [[digital intelligence]] - a meta-intelligence composed of many other identified intelligences and stemmed from human interactions with digital computers - now exists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Nan B.|date=2004|title=Digital Intelligence Fostered by Technology|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ905130|journal=Journal of Technology Studies|volume=30|issue=2|pages=93\u201397|via=ERIC}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\nGardner argues that there is a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.\n\n[[Intelligence test]]s and [[psychometrics]] have generally found high correlations between different aspects of intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner's theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] rather than multiple intelligences (MI).<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Geake|first1 = John|title = Neuromythologies in education|journal = Educational Research|year = 2008|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 123\u2013133|doi = 10.1080/00131880802082518}}</ref> The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of [[empirical evidence]], and its dependence on subjective judgement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Waterhouse|first1 = Lynn|title = WATERHOUSE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES Multiple Intelligences, the Mozart Effect, and Emotional Intelligence: A Critical Review|journal = Educational Psychologist|year = 2006|volume = 41|issue = 4|pages = 207\u2013225|url = http://www.faculty.mun.ca/cmattatall/Multiple_Intelligences_.pdf|doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1}}</ref>\n\n=== Definition of intelligence ===\nOne major criticism of the theory is that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word \"intelligence\", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word \"intelligence\" where other people have traditionally used words like \"ability\" and \"[[aptitude]]\". This practice has been criticized by [[Robert J. Sternberg]],{{r|Sternberg1983}}{{r|Sternberg1991}} [[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]],{{sfn|Eysenck|1994|p=|ps=}} and Scarr.{{r|Scarr}} White (2006) points out that Gardner's selection and application of criteria for his \"intelligences\" is subjective and arbitrary, and that a different researcher would likely have come up with different criteria.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=489|ps=}}\n\nDefenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus a broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Nikolova, K., & Taneva-Shopova, S.|year = 2007|title = Multiple intelligences theory and educational practice|publisher = Annual Assesn Zlatarov University|volume = 26|issue = 2|pages = 105\u2013109|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264892931}}</ref>\n\nSome criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not provided a test of his multiple intelligences. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. He then added a [[disclaimer]] that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:\n\n{{quote|Ultimately, it would certainly be desirable to have an [[algorithm]] for the selection of intelligence, such that any [[Researcher|trained researcher]] could determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria. At present, however, it must be admitted that the selection (or rejection) of a candidate's intelligence is reminiscent more of an [[Aesthetics|artistic judgment]] than of a scientific assessment.{{sfn|Gardner|1983|p=|ps=}}}}\n\nGenerally, linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities are called intelligence, but artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities are not. Gardner argues this causes the former to be needlessly aggrandized. Certain critics are wary of this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores \"the connotation of intelligence&nbsp;... [which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school.\"{{r|Willingham}}\n\nGardner writes \"I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot.\"{{r|Gardner1998}} Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as \"intelligence\". Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's edition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligence are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ value]].\n\nThe theory and definitions have been critiqued by Perry D. Klein as being so unclear as to be [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]] and thus [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]. Having a high musical ability means being good at music while at the same time being good at music is explained by having high musical ability.{{r|Klein}}\n\n[[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]] argues that \"We can not distinguish intelligence from its operations\".<ref>According to formulation of \u00c9mile Jalley for Henri Wallon in ''Principes de psychologie appliqu\u00e9e'' (\u0152uvre 1, \u00e9dition L'Harmattan, 2015) : \u00ab On ne saurait distinguer l'intelligence de ses op\u00e9rations \u00bb</ref> Yves Richez distinguishes 10 Natural Operating Modes (''Modes Op\u00e9ratoires Naturels - MoON'').<ref>{{cite book |last=Richez |first=Yves |year=2018 |title=Corporate talent detection and development |publisher=Wiley Publishing}}</ref> Richez's studies are premised on a gap between Chinese thought and Western thought. In China, the notion of \"being\" (self) and the notion of \"intelligence\" don't exist. These are claimed to be Graeco-Roman inventions derived from Plato. Instead of intelligence, Chinese refers to \"operating modes\", which is why Yves Richez does not speak of \"intelligence\" but of \"natural operating modes\" (''MoON'').\n\n=== Neo-Piagetian criticism ===\n[[Andreas Demetriou]] suggests that theories which overemphasize the autonomy of the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other.{{r|Demetriou2011}} Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and [[social intelligence]] are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou's theory, one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as [[cognitive processing speed|speed of processing]], [[executive functions]], [[working memory]], and [[metacognition|meta-cognitive processes]] underlying [[self-awareness]] and [[Self control|self-regulation]]. All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.{{sfn|Demetriou|Raftopoulos|2005|p=68|ps=}}\n\nThe domains are to a large extent expressions of the condition of the general processes, and may vary because of their constitutional differences but also differences in individual preferences and inclinations. Their functioning both channels and influences the operation of the general processes.{{r|Architecture}}{{r|Efficiency}} Thus, one cannot satisfactorily specify the intelligence of an individual or design effective intervention programs unless both the general processes and the domains of interest are evaluated.{{r|Self-awareness}}{{sfn|Demetriou|Mouyi|Spanoudis|2010|pp=|ps=}}\n\n=== Human adaptation to multiple environments ===\nThe premise of the multiple intelligences hypothesis, that human intelligence is a collection of specialist abilities, have been criticized for not being able to explain human adaptation to most if not all environments in the world. In this context, humans are contrasted to [[social insect]]s that indeed have a distributed \"intelligence\" of specialists, and such insects may spread to climates resembling that of their origin but the same species never adapt to a wide range of climates from tropical to temperate by building different types of nests and learning what is edible and what is poisonous. While some such as the [[leafcutter ant]] grow fungi on leaves, they do not cultivate different species in different environments with different farming techniques as human [[agriculture]] does. It is therefore argued that human adaptability stems from a general ability to [[falsifiability|falsify hypotheses]] and make more generally accurate predictions and adapt behavior thereafter, and not a set of specialized abilities which would only work under specific environmental conditions.<ref>Steven Mithen 2005 edition|\"Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory\"</ref><ref>Rolf W. Frohlich 2009 edition|\"Evolutionary Intelligence: The Anatomy of Human Survival\"</ref>\n\n=== IQ tests ===\nGardner argues that IQ tests only measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities. He argues the importance of assessing in an \"intelligence-fair\" manner. While traditional paper-and-pen examinations favor linguistic and logical skills, there is a need for intelligence-fair measures that value the distinct modalities of thinking and learning that uniquely define each intelligence.<ref name=G-H/>\n\nPsychologist [[Alan S. Kaufman]] points out that IQ tests have measured spatial abilities for 70 years.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}} Modern IQ tests are greatly influenced by the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While IQ tests do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}}\n\n=== Lack of empirical evidence ===\nAccording to a 2006 study, many of Gardner's \"intelligences\" correlate with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], supporting the idea of a single dominant type of intelligence. According to the study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of ''g'', of cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}\n\nThe [http://jocrf.org Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation] has tested hundreds of thousands of people<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jocrf.org/about|title=About Us {{!}} Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation|website=jocrf.org|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> to determine their \"aptitudes\" (\"intelligences\"), such as manual dexterity, musical ability, spatial visualization, and memory for numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jocrf.org/|title=Aptitude Testing and Research since 1922 {{!}} Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation|website=www.jocrf.org|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>  There is correlation of these aptitudes with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], but not all are strongly correlated; correlation between the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] and \"inductive speed\" (\"quickness in seeing relationships among separate facts, ideas, or observations\") is only 0.5,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardhaier.com/articles/intelligence-creativity-and-cognition/gray-matter-and-intelligence-factors-is-there-a-neuro-g-pdf|title=Gray Matter and Intelligence Factors: Is There a Neuro-g?

In contrast, empirical support for non-''g'' intelligences is either lacking or very poor. She argued that despite this, the ideas of multiple non-''g'' intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.{{r|Gottfredson2006}} \n\nA critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:\n{{quote|To date, there have been no published studies that offer evidence of the validity of the multiple intelligences. In 1994 Sternberg reported finding no empirical studies. In 2000 Allix reported finding no [[empirical]] validating studies, and at that time Gardner and Connell conceded that there was \"little hard evidence for MI theory\" (2000, p. 292). In 2004 Sternberg and Grigerenko stated that there were no validating studies for multiple intelligences, and in 2004 Gardner asserted that he would be \"delighted were such evidence to accrue\",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}} and admitted that \"MI theory has few enthusiasts among psychometricians or others of a traditional psychological background\" because they require \"psychometric or experimental evidence that allows one to prove the existence of the several intelligences.\"{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}}{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}\n\nThe same review presents evidence to demonstrate that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research does not support the theory of multiple intelligences:\n{{quote|... the human brain is unlikely to function via Gardner's multiple intelligences. Taken together the evidence for the intercorrelations of subskills of IQ measures, the evidence for a shared set of genes associated with mathematics, reading, and g, and the evidence for shared and overlapping \"what is it?\" and \"where is it?\" neural processing pathways, and shared neural pathways for language, music, motor skills, and emotions suggest that it is unlikely that each of Gardner's intelligences could operate \"via a different set of neural mechanisms\" (1999, p. 99). Equally important, the evidence for the \"what is it?\" and \"where is it?\" processing pathways, for Kahneman's two decision-making systems, and for adapted cognition modules suggests that these cognitive brain specializations have evolved to address very specific problems in our environment. Because Gardner claimed that the intelligences are innate potentialities related to a general content area, MI theory lacks a rationale for the phylogenetic emergence of the intelligences.{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}\n\nThe theory of multiple intelligences is sometimes cited as an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it lacks empirical evidence or [[falsifiability]],<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/24174224/Multiple_Intelligences_and_pseudo-_science Multiple Intelligences and pseudo-science] Van der Ploeg, 2016. academia.edu</ref> though Gardner has argued otherwise.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gardner | first = Howard | title = Reflections on Multiple Intelligences: Myths and Messages | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | pages = 200\u2013209 | date = November 1995}}</ref>\n\n== Use in education ==\nGardner defines intelligence as \"bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture.\"{{sfn|Gardner|1999|pp=33\u201334|ps=}} According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling \"should be to develop intelligence and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligence. People who are helped to do so, [he] believe[s], feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve the society in a constructive way.\"{{efn|This information is based on an informal talk given on the 350th anniversary of Harvard University on 5 September 1986. Harvard Education Review, Harvard Education Publishing Group, 1987, 57, 187\u201393.}}\n\nGardner contends that IQ tests focus mostly on logical and linguistic intelligence. Upon doing well on these tests, the chances of attending a prestigious college or university increase, which in turn creates contributing members of society.{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=6|ps=}} While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence. It challenges educators to find \"ways that will work for this student learning this topic\".{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=154|ps=}}\n\n[[James Traub]]'s article in ''The New Republic'' notes that Gardner's system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching.{{r|Traub}} Gardner states that \"while Multiple Intelligences theory is consistent with much\nempirical evidence, it has not been subjected to strong experimental tests&nbsp;...

[[Howard Gardner]] proposed this model in his 1983 book ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. According to the theory, an intelligence 'modality' must fulfill eight criteria:{{r|Gilman}}\n# potential for brain isolation by [[brain damage]]\n# place in [[evolutionary history]]\n# presence of core operations\n# susceptibility to encoding (symbolic expression)\n# a distinct developmental progression\n# the existence of [[savant syndrome|savant]]s, prodigies and other exceptional people\n# support from [[experimental psychology]]\n# support from [[psychometric]] findings\n\nGardner proposed eight abilities that he held to meet these criteria:<ref>Slavin, Robert (2009), ''Educational Psychology'', p. 117, {{ISBN|0-205-59200-7}}</ref> \n# musical-rhythmic,\n# [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|visual-spatial]],\n# [[linguistic intelligence|verbal-linguistic]],\n# logical-mathematical,\n# [[Physical Intelligence|bodily-kinesthetic]],\n# interpersonal,\n# intrapersonal,\n# naturalistic\n\nIn 2009, he suggested that [[Spiritual intelligence|existential]] and [[ethics|moral]] intelligences may also be worthy of inclusion.{{r|Smith}}\n\nAlthough the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labeling learners to a specific intelligence. Gardner maintains that his theory should \"empower learners\", not restrict them to one modality of learning.<ref>McKenzie, W. (2005). Multiple intelligences and instructional technology. ISTE (International Society for Technology Education). {{ISBN|156484188X}}</ref> According to Gardner, an intelligence is \"a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture.\"{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=33-4|ps=}} According to a 2006 study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}\n\n== Intelligence Modalities ==\n\n=== Musical-rhythmic and harmonic ===\n{{main|Musicality}}\n\nThis area has to do with sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, [[Pitch (music)|tones]], and music. People with a high musical intelligence normally have good pitch and may even have [[absolute pitch]], and are able to sing, play musical instruments, and compose music. They have sensitivity to rhythm, pitch, meter, tone, melody or timbre.{{r|PBS}}<ref name=G-H>{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H., & Hatch, T. |title=Multiple intelligences go to school: Educational implications of the theory of multiple intelligences|doi=10.3102/0013189X018008004|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jcnesbit/EDUC220/ThinkPaper/Gardner1989.pdf|year=1989|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|issue=8|page=4|last2=Hatch}}</ref>\n\n=== Visual-spatial ===\n{{main|Spatial intelligence (psychology)}}\n\nThis area deals with spatial judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind's eye. Spatial ability is one of the three factors beneath ''g'' in the hierarchical model of intelligence.<ref name=G-H />\n\n=== Verbal-linguistic ===\n{{main|Linguistic intelligence}}\n\nPeople with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with words and languages. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with dates.<ref name=G-H /> Verbal ability is one of the most ''g''-loaded abilities.<ref>Wechsler, D. (1997). [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] III.</ref>\nThis type of intelligence is measured with the [[Verbal IQ|Verbal IQ in WAIS-IV]].\n\n=== Logical-mathematical ===\n{{further|Reason}}\n\nThis area has to do with [[logic]], abstractions, reasoning, numbers and critical thinking.<ref name=G-H /> This also has to do with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system.{{r|PBS}} Logical reasoning is closely linked to [[fluid intelligence]] and to [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence (''g'' factor)]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=J.

Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.{{r|Heteroglossia}}\n\n=== Interpersonal ===\n{{main|Social skills}}\n\nIn theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group. According to Gardner in ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom'', \"Inter- and Intra- personal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people...\"<ref>Gardner, H. (1995). ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom\u2014Administrators' Version''. {{ISBN|1-887943-03-X}}. National Professional Resources Dr. Howard Gardner, along with teachers and students from Fuller Elementary School in Gloucester, MA, discuss the theory behind Multiple Intelligences and demonstrate how they have integrated it into their classrooms and community. (41 minutes)</ref> Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate.\" Gardner has equated this with [[emotional intelligence]] of Goleman.<ref>Gardner, H. (2015).

(at 17 minutes). soundcloud.com</ref>\n\nGardner believes that careers that suit those with high interpersonal intelligence include [[sales persons]], [[politician]]s, managers, [[teacher]]s, [[lecturer]]s, [[Psychology|counselors]] and [[social worker]]s.{{r|Gardner2002}}\n\n=== Intrapersonal ===\n{{further|Introspection}}\n\nThis area has to do with introspective and self-reflective capacities. This refers to having a deep understanding of the self; what one's strengths or weaknesses are, what makes one unique, being able to predict one's own reactions or emotions.\n\n=== Naturalistic ===\nNot part of Gardner's original seven, naturalistic intelligence was proposed by him in 1995. \"If I were to rewrite Frames of Mind today, I would probably add an eighth intelligence \u2013 the intelligence of the naturalist. It seems to me that the individual who is readily able to recognize flora and fauna, to make other consequential distinctions in the natural world, and to use this ability productively (in hunting, in farming, in biological science) is exercising an important intelligence and one that is not adequately encompassed in the current list.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H. |year=1995|title=Reflections on multiple intelligences: Myths and messages|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume= 77|pages= 200\u2013209|url=https://learnweb.harvard.edu/WIDE/courses/files/Reflections.pdf}}</ref> This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings.<ref name=G-H /> Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types.

Check minutes 5:00 \u2013 5:55 and 8:16</ref> In the same interview, he explicitly refused some other suggested intelligences like humour, cooking and sexual intelligence.<ref name=\"Gard16\"/> Professor Nan B. Adams (2004) argues that based on Gardner's definition of Multiple Intelligences, [[digital intelligence]] - a meta-intelligence composed of many other identified intelligences and stemmed from human interactions with digital computers - now exists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Nan B.|date=2004|title=Digital Intelligence Fostered by Technology|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ905130|journal=Journal of Technology Studies|volume=30|issue=2|pages=93\u201397|via=ERIC}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\nGardner argues that there is a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.\n\n[[Intelligence test]]s and [[psychometrics]] have generally found high correlations between different aspects of intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner's theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] rather than multiple intelligences (MI).<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Geake|first1 = John|title = Neuromythologies in education|journal = Educational Research|year = 2008|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 123\u2013133|doi = 10.1080/00131880802082518}}</ref> The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of [[empirical evidence]], and its dependence on subjective judgement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Waterhouse|first1 = Lynn|title = WATERHOUSE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES Multiple Intelligences, the Mozart Effect, and Emotional Intelligence: A Critical Review|journal = Educational Psychologist|year = 2006|volume = 41|issue = 4|pages = 207\u2013225|url = http://www.faculty.mun.ca/cmattatall/Multiple_Intelligences_.pdf|doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1}}</ref>\n\n=== Definition of intelligence ===\nOne major criticism of the theory is that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word \"intelligence\", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word \"intelligence\" where other people have traditionally used words like \"ability\" and \"[[aptitude]]\". This practice has been criticized by [[Robert J. Sternberg]],{{r|Sternberg1983}}{{r|Sternberg1991}} [[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]],{{sfn|Eysenck|1994|p=|ps=}} and Scarr.{{r|Scarr}} White (2006) points out that Gardner's selection and application of criteria for his \"intelligences\" is subjective and arbitrary, and that a different researcher would likely have come up with different criteria.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=489|ps=}}\n\nDefenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus a broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Nikolova, K., & Taneva-Shopova, S.|year = 2007|title = Multiple intelligences theory and educational practice|publisher = Annual Assesn Zlatarov University|volume = 26|issue = 2|pages = 105\u2013109|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264892931}}</ref>\n\nSome criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not provided a test of his multiple intelligences. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. He then added a [[disclaimer]] that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:\n\n{{quote|Ultimately, it would certainly be desirable to have an [[algorithm]] for the selection of intelligence, such that any [[Researcher|trained researcher]] could determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria. At present, however, it must be admitted that the selection (or rejection) of a candidate's intelligence is reminiscent more of an [[Aesthetics|artistic judgment]] than of a scientific assessment.{{sfn|Gardner|1983|p=|ps=}}}}\n\nGenerally, linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities are called intelligence, but artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities are not. Gardner argues this causes the former to be needlessly aggrandized. Certain critics are wary of this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores \"the connotation of intelligence&nbsp;... [which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school.\"{{r|Willingham}}\n\nGardner writes \"I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot.\"{{r|Gardner1998}} Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as \"intelligence\". Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's edition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligence are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ value]].\n\nThe theory and definitions have been critiqued by Perry D. Klein as being so unclear as to be [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]] and thus [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]. Having a high musical ability means being good at music while at the same time being good at music is explained by having high musical ability.{{r|Klein}}\n\n[[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]] argues that \"We can not distinguish intelligence from its operations\".<ref>According to formulation of \u00c9mile Jalley for Henri Wallon in ''Principes de psychologie appliqu\u00e9e'' (\u0152uvre 1, \u00e9dition L'Harmattan, 2015) : \u00ab On ne saurait distinguer l'intelligence de ses op\u00e9rations \u00bb</ref> Yves Richez distinguishes 10 Natural Operating Modes (''Modes Op\u00e9ratoires Naturels - MoON'').<ref>{{cite book |last=Richez |first=Yves |year=2018 |title=Corporate talent detection and development |publisher=Wiley Publishing}}</ref> Richez's studies are premised on a gap between Chinese thought and Western thought. In China, the notion of \"being\" (self) and the notion of \"intelligence\" don't exist. These are claimed to be Graeco-Roman inventions derived from Plato. Instead of intelligence, Chinese refers to \"operating modes\", which is why Yves Richez does not speak of \"intelligence\" but of \"natural operating modes\" (''MoON'').\n\n=== Neo-Piagetian criticism ===\n[[Andreas Demetriou]] suggests that theories which overemphasize the autonomy of the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other.{{r|Demetriou2011}} Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and [[social intelligence]] are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou's theory, one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as [[cognitive processing speed|speed of processing]], [[executive functions]], [[working memory]], and [[metacognition|meta-cognitive processes]] underlying [[self-awareness]] and [[Self control|self-regulation]]. All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.{{sfn|Demetriou|Raftopoulos|2005|p=68|ps=}}\n\nThe domains are to a large extent expressions of the condition of the general processes, and may vary because of their constitutional differences but also differences in individual preferences and inclinations. Their functioning both channels and influences the operation of the general processes.{{r|Architecture}}{{r|Efficiency}} Thus, one cannot satisfactorily specify the intelligence of an individual or design effective intervention programs unless both the general processes and the domains of interest are evaluated.{{r|Self-awareness}}{{sfn|Demetriou|Mouyi|Spanoudis|2010|pp=|ps=}}\n\n=== Human adaptation to multiple environments ===\nThe premise of the multiple intelligences hypothesis, that human intelligence is a collection of specialist abilities, have been criticized for not being able to explain human adaptation to most if not all environments in the world. In this context, humans are contrasted to [[social insect]]s that indeed have a distributed \"intelligence\" of specialists, and such insects may spread to climates resembling that of their origin but the same species never adapt to a wide range of climates from tropical to temperate by building different types of nests and learning what is edible and what is poisonous. While some such as the [[leafcutter ant]] grow fungi on leaves, they do not cultivate different species in different environments with different farming techniques as human [[agriculture]] does. It is therefore argued that human adaptability stems from a general ability to [[falsifiability|falsify hypotheses]] and make more generally accurate predictions and adapt behavior thereafter, and not a set of specialized abilities which would only work under specific environmental conditions.<ref>Steven Mithen 2005 edition|\"Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory\"</ref><ref>Rolf W. Frohlich 2009 edition|\"Evolutionary Intelligence: The Anatomy of Human Survival\"</ref>\n\n=== IQ tests ===\nGardner argues that IQ tests only measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities. He argues the importance of assessing in an \"intelligence-fair\" manner. While traditional paper-and-pen examinations favor linguistic and logical skills, there is a need for intelligence-fair measures that value the distinct modalities of thinking and learning that uniquely define each intelligence.<ref name=G-H/>\n\nPsychologist [[Alan S. Kaufman]] points out that IQ tests have measured spatial abilities for 70 years.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}} Modern IQ tests are greatly influenced by the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While IQ tests do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}}\n\n=== Lack of empirical evidence ===\nAccording to a 2006 study, many of Gardner's \"intelligences\" correlate with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], supporting the idea of a single dominant type of intelligence. According to the study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of ''g'', of cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}\n\nThe [http://jocrf.org Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation] has tested hundreds of thousands of people<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jocrf.org/about|title=About Us {{!}} Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation|website=jocrf.org|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> to determine their \"aptitudes\" (\"intelligences\"), such as manual dexterity, musical ability, spatial visualization, and memory for numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jocrf.org/|title=Aptitude Testing and Research since 1922 {{!}} Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation|website=www.jocrf.org|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>  There is correlation of these aptitudes with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], but not all are strongly correlated; correlation between the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] and \"inductive speed\" (\"quickness in seeing relationships among separate facts, ideas, or observations\") is only 0.5,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardhaier.com/articles/intelligence-creativity-and-cognition/gray-matter-and-intelligence-factors-is-there-a-neuro-g-pdf|title=Gray Matter and Intelligence Factors: Is There a Neuro-g?

In contrast, empirical support for non-''g'' intelligences is either lacking or very poor. She argued that despite this, the ideas of multiple non-''g'' intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.{{r|Gottfredson2006}} \n\nA critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:\n{{quote|To date, there have been no published studies that offer evidence of the validity of the multiple intelligences. In 1994 Sternberg reported finding no empirical studies. In 2000 Allix reported finding no [[empirical]] validating studies, and at that time Gardner and Connell conceded that there was \"little hard evidence for MI theory\" (2000, p. 292). In 2004 Sternberg and Grigerenko stated that there were no validating studies for multiple intelligences, and in 2004 Gardner asserted that he would be \"delighted were such evidence to accrue\",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}} and admitted that \"MI theory has few enthusiasts among psychometricians or others of a traditional psychological background\" because they require \"psychometric or experimental evidence that allows one to prove the existence of the several intelligences.\"{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}}{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}\n\nThe same review presents evidence to demonstrate that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research does not support the theory of multiple intelligences:\n{{quote|... the human brain is unlikely to function via Gardner's multiple intelligences. Taken together the evidence for the intercorrelations of subskills of IQ measures, the evidence for a shared set of genes associated with mathematics, reading, and g, and the evidence for shared and overlapping \"what is it?\" and \"where is it?\" neural processing pathways, and shared neural pathways for language, music, motor skills, and emotions suggest that it is unlikely that each of Gardner's intelligences could operate \"via a different set of neural mechanisms\" (1999, p. 99). Equally important, the evidence for the \"what is it?\" and \"where is it?\" processing pathways, for Kahneman's two decision-making systems, and for adapted cognition modules suggests that these cognitive brain specializations have evolved to address very specific problems in our environment. Because Gardner claimed that the intelligences are innate potentialities related to a general content area, MI theory lacks a rationale for the phylogenetic emergence of the intelligences.{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}\n\nThe theory of multiple intelligences is sometimes cited as an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it lacks empirical evidence or [[falsifiability]],<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/24174224/Multiple_Intelligences_and_pseudo-_science Multiple Intelligences and pseudo-science] Van der Ploeg, 2016. academia.edu</ref> though Gardner has argued otherwise.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gardner | first = Howard | title = Reflections on Multiple Intelligences: Myths and Messages | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | pages = 200\u2013209 | date = November 1995}}</ref>\n\n== Use in education ==\nGardner defines intelligence as \"bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture.\"{{sfn|Gardner|1999|pp=33\u201334|ps=}} According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling \"should be to develop intelligence and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligence. People who are helped to do so, [he] believe[s], feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve the society in a constructive way.\"{{efn|This information is based on an informal talk given on the 350th anniversary of Harvard University on 5 September 1986. Harvard Education Review, Harvard Education Publishing Group, 1987, 57, 187\u201393.}}\n\nGardner contends that IQ tests focus mostly on logical and linguistic intelligence. Upon doing well on these tests, the chances of attending a prestigious college or university increase, which in turn creates contributing members of society.{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=6|ps=}} While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence. It challenges educators to find \"ways that will work for this student learning this topic\".{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=154|ps=}}\n\n[[James Traub]]'s article in ''The New Republic'' notes that Gardner's system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching.{{r|Traub}} Gardner states that \"while Multiple Intelligences theory is consistent with much\nempirical evidence, it has not been subjected to strong experimental tests&nbsp;... Within the area of education, the applications of the theory are currently being examined in many projects. Our hunches will have to be revised many times in light of actual classroom experience.\"{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=33|ps=}}\n\n[[Jerome Bruner]] agreed with Gardner that the intelligence was \"useful fictions,\" and went on to state that \"his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/state-of-the-child/ |title=State of the Child |last=Bruner |first=Jerome |magazine=New York Review of Books}}</ref>\n\n[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], a prominent cognitive psychologist, wrote in ''The New York Times Book Review'' that Gardner's argument consisted of \"hunch and opinion\" and Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994) called Gardner's theory \"uniquely devoid of psychometric or other quantitative evidence.\"{{r|Eberstadt}}\n\nIn spite of its lack of general acceptance in the psychological community, Gardner's theory has been adopted by many schools, where it is often conflated with [[learning styles]],{{sfn|Howard-Jones|2010|p=23|ps=}} and hundreds of books have been written about its applications in education.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=486|ps=}} Some of the applications of Gardner's theory have been described as \"simplistic\" and Gardner himself has said he is \"uneasy\" with the way his theory has been used in schools.{{r|Revell}} Gardner has denied that multiple intelligences are learning styles and agrees that the idea of learning styles is incoherent and lacking in empirical evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 10 October 2014}}</ref> Gardner summarizes his approach with three recommendations for educators:  individualize the teaching style (to suit the most effective method for each student), pluralize the teaching (teach important materials in multiple ways), and avoid the term \"styles\" as being confusing.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Charles Spearman]]\n* [[Savant syndrome]]\n\n== References ==\n;Notes\n{{notelist|notes=}}\n\n;Citations\n{{reflist|30em|refs=<ref name=\"Architecture\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Demetriou |first1=A. |last2=Efklides |first2=A. |last3=Platsidou |first3=M. |year=1993 |title=The architecture and dynamics of developing mind: Experiential structuralism as a frame for unifying cognitive developmental theories |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |volume=58 |issue=234 |doi=10.2307/1166053 |last4=Campbell |first4=Robert L. |pages=i|jstor=1166053 }}</ref><ref name=\"Demetriou2011\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Demetriou |first1=A. |last2=Spanoudis |first2=G. |last3=Mouyi |first3=A. |year=2011 |title==Educating the Developing Mind: Towards an Overarching Paradigm |journal=Educational Psychology Review |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=601\u2013663 |doi=10.1007/s10648-011-9178-3|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eberstadt\">\n{{cite journal |last=Eberstadt|first=Mary |title=The Schools They Deserve |date=October\u2013November 1999 |journal=Policy Review |url=http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/0817928723_17.pdf }}</ref><ref name=\"Efficiency\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Demetriou, A. |first1=Christou, C. |last2=Spanoudis |first2=G. |last3=Platsidou |first3=M. |year=2002 |title=The development of mental processing: Efficiency, working memory, and thinking |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |volume=67 |issue=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Gardner1998\">\n{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=A Reply to Perry D.
