San Francisco was chosen as the location for the first Gay Games not only because it was the home of founder Tom Waddell, but also because the games had support from local government and essential services, and because there was a large gay and lesbian population in San Francisco that could serve as volunteers and leaders. The opening ceremonies, held in Kezar Stadium, began with former U.S. Olympians, George Frenn and Susan McGrievey lighting a flame that had been carried on a torch run across America, beginning in New York at the Stonewall Inn.<ref>{{Cite book|last=edited by Rita Liberti and Maureen M.

There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122071856/http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |archivedate=November 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate. The Chicago Gay Games VII ended with no debt and all bills paid. In contrast, the Montreal World Outgames ended with $5.3 million (Canadian) of debt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn addition, the lack of attendees and participants at both events resulted in GLISA (the organization which heads the Outgames) changing the years of the event to precede the years of the Gay Games, {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}meaning that the World Outgames were held in 2009 in Copenhagen and the Gay Games held in Cologne in 2010, while the World Outgames were held in 2013 in Antwerp and Gay Games were held in 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n=== Media impact of AIDS on the Gay Games ===\nBefore and during the time of the 1986 Gay Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]) and how it was affecting the gay community.<ref name=\":1\" /> With the number of [[LGBT]] members at the Gay Games the founder Waddell took this time try and break the stereotype of the AIDS with a show of athleticism the Gay Games had to offer.<ref name=\":0\" /> This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Sports}}\n* [[EuroGames|EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)]]\n* [[International Gay and Lesbian Football Association]]\n* [[List of LGBT sportspeople]]\n* [[Principle 6 campaign]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130929011426/http://www.gg9cle.com/ Gay Games Cleveland/Akron 2014]\n* [http://www.gaygames.org/ Federation of Gay Games]\n* [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5868750,00.html Postcard from Europe: Questioning the necessity of the Gay Games]\n* [http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00450.xml Minnesota lesbian/gay committee of the International Athletic Association archives]\n*  [http://www.vivomediaarts.com/archive/gay-games-iii/ Documentation of Celebration '90 Gay Games III held in Vancouver on VIVO Media Arts Centre's website]\n* [http://gaytodo.com/ Gay Ireland]\n\n{{Gay Games}}\n{{International multi-sport events}}\n\n[[Category:Gay Games]]\n[[Category:Quadrennial sporting events]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1982]]\n[[Category:LGBT sports]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Gay Olympics|other events|Gay Olympics (disambiguation)}}\n{{Distinguish|Outgames}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2013}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[File:Gay Games 2006 End-Ceremony 03.jpg|thumb|300px|The Gay Games Closing Ceremony 2006 \u2013 Handing off the flag to the [[Cologne, Germany]] contingent, host of Gay Games 2010]]\nThe '''Gay Games''' is a worldwide sport and cultural event that promotes acceptance of [[sexual diversity]], featuring [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) athletes and artists.\n\nFounded as the '''Gay Olympics''', it was started in the United States in [[San Francisco, California]], in 1982, as the brainchild of Olympic decathlete (Mexico City 1968) and medical doctor [[Tom Waddell]], [[Rikki Streicher]],<ref>ROB MORSE, San Francisco Chronicle, Perspiration Condemnation for N.Y.

There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released.

Their audience was measured at eight million listeners by [[RAJAR]], and [[Simon Mayo]] also revolutionized British radio by introducing the format when on 23 May 1988 he took over [[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]] from  [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] which also featured co-presenters including news anchor Rod McKenzie and three sidekick weather and travel girls, including Carol Dooley, [[Sybil Ruscoe]], [[Jackie Brambles]] and [[Dianne Oxberry]], and the show's producer [[Ric Blaxill]] who made regular speaking contributions. The programme also became known for various features, including [[On This Day In History]], the long-running cryptic game ''[[The Identik-Hit Quiz]]'', where Mayo and his co hosts would 'act' a short scene which cryptically led listeners to the title of a hit song, and also his ''[[Confessions (radio)|Confessions]]'' feature where members of the public sought absolution for their (often frivolous or humorous) \"sins\".\n\nThe format is used on stations of many different genres.

Financial transactions that benefit the designated terrorist organisations are usually outlawed.\n\nDesignated terrorist organisations may adopt a variety of strategies to get past efforts to prevent such funding. For example, they may make multiple smaller-value transfers in an attempt to bypass scrutiny; or they may use people who have no criminal backgrounds to complete financial transactions to try to make fund transfers harder to track. These transactions may also be disguised as donations to charities<ref name=\"Ridley 38\u201357\">{{Cite journal|last=Ridley|first=Nicholas|last2=Alexander|first2=Dean C.|date=2011-12-30|title=Combating terrorist financing in the first decade of the twenty\u2010first century|journal=Journal of Money Laundering Control|volume=15|issue=1|pages=38\u201357|doi=10.1108/13685201211194727|issn=1368-5201}}</ref> or as gifts to family members.

Reverse transactions of this nature are also suspicious.\n* Issuing cheques, money orders or other [[financial instruments]], often numbered sequentially, to the same person or business, or to a person or business whose name is spelled similarly.\n\nIt would be difficult to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to [[organized crime]]. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have [[Criminal record|police records]], particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]] or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a [[Politically exposed person]] (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.\n\n== Nation specific actions ==\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{anchor | Pakistan }}\n{{see also | The Establishment (Pakistan) | Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism | Inter-Services Intelligence activities in India | Inter-Services Intelligence activities in Afghanistan }}\n\nAs at 24 October 2019, Pakistan was on the [[FATF greylist]] for terrorism financing and has met only 5 of 27 action items, and it has been given four months to comply with the remaining action points for the prevention of terror financing.<ref name=PakGreylisted1/><ref name=PakGreylisted2/>\n\n===Bahrain===\n[[Bahrain]] has been regularly accused of doing very little to prevent the flow of funds for the terrorism financing in other nations.

Reverse transactions of this nature are also suspicious.\n* Issuing cheques, money orders or other [[financial instruments]], often numbered sequentially, to the same person or business, or to a person or business whose name is spelled similarly.\n\nIt would be difficult to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to [[organized crime]]. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have [[Criminal record|police records]], particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]] or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a [[Politically exposed person]] (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.\n\n== Nation specific actions ==\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{anchor | Pakistan }}\n{{see also | The Establishment (Pakistan) | Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism | Inter-Services Intelligence activities in India | Inter-Services Intelligence activities in Afghanistan }}\n\nAs at 24 October 2019, Pakistan was on the [[FATF greylist]] for terrorism financing and has met only 5 of 27 action items, and it has been given four months to comply with the remaining action points for the prevention of terror financing.<ref name=PakGreylisted1/><ref name=PakGreylisted2/>\n\n===Bahrain===\n[[Bahrain]] has been regularly accused of doing very little to prevent the flow of funds for the terrorism financing in other nations.

{"title_page": "Naru", "text_new": "Naru is a Tribe/Sub Clane Of [[Rajput]] Mainly Occupied in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab|Punjab]], Pakistan. Their ancient head-quarters were the districts of Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur. After Partition Of Pakistan and India\nThe Narus of Hoshiarpur District claim that their ancestor was a Surajbansi (Suryavanshi) Rajput of Muttra, named Nipal Chand, descended from Raja Ram Chand. He was converted in the time of Mahmud of Ghazni and took the name of Naru Shah. Naru Shah settled at Mau in Jalandhar, whence his son, Ratan Pal, founded Phillaur hence founded the four Naru parganas of Hariana, Bajwara, Sham Chaurasi and Ghorewaha in Hoshiarpur and that of Bahram in Jullunder. The chief men of these parganas are still called Rai or Rana. Some kept Brahmans of the Baadeo got.\n\nTheir are Many Famous Personalities in Naru Tribes and a Populer Entrepreneur Of Pakistan Muhammad Bilal Rasheed ( Naru Rajput ) Is Running a Company Naru Digital Services Which is Occupied in Sillanwali, District Sargodha.\n[[File:Muhammad Bilal Rasheed|thumb|Muhammad Bilal Rasheed { Naru Digital Services }]]\n  \nMahmud of Ghazni conquered the country on both sides of the Sutlej River, and placed Talochar in charge of it. After leaving Mau he made Bajwara his capital, but the attacks made on him by the hill chiefs compelled him to invoke Mahmud\u2019s aid, and Pathan troops were sent him who were cantoned along the foot of the Siwaliks and are still settled there. Rana Sihra, Naru Khan\u2019s descendant in the fifth generation, returned to Ajudhia, whence Talochar had come, and re-conquered his ancient kingdom, over which he appointed a viceroy. He died at his way back to Punjab at Sunam. His third descendant, Rana Mal, had five sons - Kilcha, Bhoja, Dhuni, Massa and Jassa, who divided the territory. Kilcha got the Hariana ilaqa with 750 villages, including Nandachuar, Bahram, Bulhowal, with the title of Tika. Bhoja got Bajwara, Sham Chaurasi, Ahrana, Ajram, Baroti and their dependent villages. Dhuni got the Dhuniat, i.e., Patti, Khanaura, Muna, Badla, Harta, Mukhliana, Phaglana, matiana, etc. Naru Khan\u2019s grandson Baripal had already seized Bhangala, and Dasuya.\n\nBasically, naru rajputs are surajbansi rajputs. Historically they are from Rajastan and many of them now living in punjab. They are now mostly Muslims. Some are in Pakistan and a few are living in India. In Pakistan they mostly found in Sialkot, Lahore, shiekhupura, gujranwala, Sargodha, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Okara, Depalpur and Faisalabad. Large numbers of Naru live in the city of Faisalabad, large numbers are related with textile business, some are doctors, lawyers, and they are called Rana and Rao. 6500 to 7500 population of Naru settled in Chak 561/G.B Tehsil Jaranwala District Faisalabad, especially in a villages of sub-division Samundari which is called Nara Dada and Chak # 137 GB (Nanak Kot). These Narus migrated from India in 1947. Nara Dada is undoubtedly one of the biggest villages with all the population belonging to sub-cast Naru. Naru from Mianwali are living in {musakhel} and {shehbaz khel} villages for over 100 years, and they are called Maliks of Mianwali. Many Naru living in Mianwali city are rich and in the transport business. Some Narus are living in Naruwala village in Tehsil Kalurkot District Bhakkar. Some are settled in Sindh province. They use the title Malik. In Sialkot they are mostly found in Pasrur Tehsil. Naru Rajputs of Pasrur claim that their ancestors belong to the royal family of Rajastan. Naru is the sub name of Raja Nipal Chand who captured the Phillaur fort in Ludhiana. Some of Narus migrated towards Punjab after the Partition of India and some settled there. In Pakistan some are in politics and serving in armed forces.\n\nAfter the partition of India, all the Muslim Naru Rajputs moved into Pakistan. But others who were Sikh and Hindu stayed in India.\n\nNarus have close links with Kachawa and Sisodia royal clans.\nHistorical Naru Rajput's\n\n    Rana Hamir Fought against Alla Ud Din Khilji\n    Raja Nipal Chand Naru Founder of Naru rajput clan and great warrior\n    Raja Rai Rattan Pal Capture the Phillaur fort and great naru rajput warrior\n    Gurdan Saini Commanded the Sisodia Rajput force of Raja Hamir Dev against Turks in 14th Century CE.\n    Rana Sihra Naru Rajput ruler.\n\nCulture and religion\n\nNaru are not allow to marry outside their tribe.

Despite openly professing his [[Roman Catholic]] faith, he enjoyed the trust of [[Elizabeth I]] and of  successive Lord Deputies of Ireland, and was even forgiven by the English  Crown  for signing a petition against the [[Penal Laws]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was the eldest surviving son of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth (d. 1589)|Christopher, 8th Baron Howth]] and his first wife Elizabeth Plunket  of [[Beaulieu House and Gardens, Co.

In 1577 Nicholas's teenage sister Jane died after being severely beaten by their father, and his mother was so ill-treated by her husband  that the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] (the Irish equivalen of.

More likely he was influenced by his second wife's father, Sir [[Nicholas White]], another bitter enemy of Dillon. This would explain his loss of favour with the Crown, since White's loyalty was deeply suspect, and he eventually died a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]].\n\nHowth in time was restored to favour and enjoyed friendly relations with the new  Lord Deputy, [[William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh|Lord Russell]], whom he entertained at Howth Castle on his arrival in Ireland. The following year he accompanied Russell on his campaign against the O'Byrnes of [[Wicklow]] and the  Lord Deputy wrote that Howth deserved some words of thanks from the Queen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In 1598 he was praised highly for being one of the few nobles of [[the Pale]] to render useful assistance to Sir [[Henry Bagenal]] in his campaign against [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], although he later complained of the depredations of Bagenal's soldiers in the Pale.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1600 he was again the first of the leaders of the Pale to entertain a new Lord Deputy, [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]], who formed a very high opinion of him and appointed him to act as Deputy in his absence.\nIn 1601 he went to London to discuss Irish affairs: the Queen who had already met and been impressed by Howth's  eldest son Christopher, also formed a high opinion of Howth himself.<ref name=eball/> On his return he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]].\n\n== Religious conflict ==\nHowth's first wife Margaret was a daughter of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]] of Turvey, who while outwardly conforming to the [[Church of Ireland]], had privately adhered to the Roman Catholic faith.
