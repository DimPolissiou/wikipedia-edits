The saga follows a young man named Simon as he is caught up in an epic adventure.\n\n==Plot introduction==\nThe story takes place on the fictional fantasy world of Osten Ard. The history of the world and the races present in Osten Ard have a great impact on the current events in the books.\nThousands of years ago the long-lived Gardenborn arrived in the land, fleeing a cataclysm. They were three tribes, the Zida'ya (commonly called [[Sithi]]), the Hikeda'ya (also called Norns) and the Tinukeda'ya (known as Dwarrows and Niskies). In Osten Ard the Gardenborn prospered and they built nine great cities of tremendous beauty. The first two tribes had ruled the third in their ancestral home called the Garden, but in Osten Ard the Tinukeda'ya went their own way, developing into two separate tribes, the seafaring Niskies and the earth-dwelling Dwarrows. The other two tribes also split ways, making a pact at Sesuad'ra, the Stone of Farewell. Their main subject of argument was the appearance of Men or mortals in Osten Ard. The Zida'ya were content to leave Men alone to go their own way, as long as they didn't trespass in Sithi lands. The Hikeda'ya were of the opinion that the mortals had to be wiped out or driven from Osten Ard. The Norns and their fell queen Utuk'u, eldest and most powerful of the Gardenborn, removed to the north of the world, taking the two northern-most cities for their own. Three cities were also given to the Tinukeda'ya, one was sea-bound Jhina't'senei which went to the Niskies and the other two were deep under the earth which went to the Dwarrows, the smaller tribe of the Tinukeda'ya. In the greatest of them all, Asu'a, the High King ruled.\n\nBut Men began to prosper and advance and the sea empire of Nabban rose and fell without it disturbing the Gardenborn. The Sithi also had great friendship with the Hernystiri of the west. Then the Rimmersmen came with iron and to them the Gardenborn were devils and demons, to be killed on sight. Unfortunately the Gardenborn suffer from a severe allergy to iron and even with their magics and their own iron-hard witchwood weapons, they were beaten back, one after the other. The Hernystiri were the only ones who stood by the Sithi in the final battle where both armies were destroyed. The remaining Sithi withdrew to Asu'a and there awaited the end. Ineluki, the King's younger son, wove terrible magic at the end with five of his servants and there they and Asu'a were destroyed. However, the spell gave the remaining Sithi time to flee to Aldheorte forest, where they continued to live in secrecy.\n\nDuring the five hundred years that follows the fall of Asu'a, six different kings ruled in the castle built on the Sithi ruins, called Hayholt. The latest of these is king John Presbyter, who is dying as the story opens.\n\nSimon is an ordinary scullery boy who is taken under the tutelage of Morgenes. When King John Presbyter dies and his son Elias ascends the throne, the way opens for a long-dormant evil to enter the realm. Elias, driven by his evil advisor, moves to eliminate his brother Josua. Caught in the struggle, Simon is forced to flee as best he can, and the young man soon finds himself taking part in adventures he had only dreamed of. \n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Seoman Snowlock|Simon]], a fourteen-year-old kitchen boy and servant in the great castle Hayholt, muddles his way through the daily routines of castle drudgery in the last days of the long reign of King John Presbyter. Simon is thrilled when luck turns his way and he finds himself apprenticed to the good Doctor Morgenes, the castle's healer and wizard, after which Simon alternates his time between his menial chores and learning to read and write, under instruction by the doctor.  Shortly after the death of the great King John, his son Elias, whom many say is a pawn of the evil cleric Pryrates, takes the throne.  Shortly afterwards, King Elias's brother Josua mysteriously disappears, and the new reign begins to curdle in suspicion and discontent.  Elias, blinded by his desire for power, creates a pact with the undead [[Sithi]] ruler, the Storm King, who himself seeks to regain his lost realm through a pact with one of human royal blood.\n\nWhen Simon accidentally stumbles into the castle dungeons, he discovers that Prince Josua is being held captive, so he and Morgenes conspire to rescue the prince. Simon and Morgenes are successful, and Josua is able to flee the castle. Soon after, Elias's soldiers, led by Pryrates, storm Morgenes's office. Morgenes is slain by a dark magic, and Simon is able to flee the castle through a secret passage at the back of the doctor's office. Armed only with his mentor's biography of the good King John, Simon is lost and despondent.\n\nAfter endless hours in the tunnels beneath Hayholt, which is actually the remains of the Sithi castle, Asu'a, Simon stumbles back into the open beyond the castle and town. There, he accidentally witnesses a scene of evil magic involving the king, Pryrates and a few white-faced and white-haired demons. Horrified, he stumbles through the woods on the road north towards Naglimund, the seat of Prince Josua. About halfway to Naglimund, he stumbles upon a strange creature, caught in a cotsman's trap. Simon realizes it must be one of the Sithi, an elven-like folk who was thought to have disappeared from the lands. He rescues him from the trap and in answer is shot at with a white arrow. At that moment, he encounters a troll by the name of Binabik. Binabik tells Simon that the white arrow is a symbol of an obligation towards Simon, and together they travel further towards Naglimund.\n\nWhile traveling through the Aldheorte forest, they save a young servant girl and her sister from vicious hounds. They travel to Gelo\u00eb, a witch who helps them escape the soldiers pursuing them. While in her house, Simon, Binabik and Gelo\u00eb also walk the Dreamroad to try to find answers but only find enemies waiting. They finally reach Naglimund, where they meet with Prince Josua. Simon begins training to be a soldier, as it is common knowledge that Elias is leading an army towards Naglimund. Whilst having a raed [council], an old man appears: Jarnauga. There, the travelers learn of the existence of three legendary swords by the names of Minneyar (or \"Year of Memory\"), Sorrow, and Thorn. The magic of these swords are the only hope against the combined power of the two High Kings, the ancient Sithi and the new-crowned human, who already have possession of at least one of the swords. They also learn the history of the Sithi and the Storm King, and of the existence of Utuk'u, Queen of the Norns, who are the northern cousins of the Sithi. It is then that Simon realizes that his vision of the dark magic just after his escape from Hayhold was no vision at all but an actual event, and that the white-faced demons were actually Norns. In Naglimund, Simon also learns of a small group of scholars known as the League of the Scroll, of which Morgenes was a member and of which Jarnauga and Binabik are also members. Binabik is only a recent member, after the death of his master Ookequk. Recognizing the true danger facing the land of Osten Ard, only the League holds the knowledge of times past, which may be the only hope of salvation for young Simon and his friends. To Simon's dismay he also finds out that Marya the serving girl whom they saved is actually Miriamele, only child and daughter of King Elias, who had fled her father's madness to join her uncle's cause.\n\nThey learn then that the black sword Thorn, once belonging to Camaris the greatest knight of history, is not lost in the depths of the sea, as once thought. It may still exist in the frozen heights to the north, near Binabik's ancestral home.\n\nSimon and Binabik join a group of soldiers to go to the far north to recover the magical blade. Along the way they run into Sithi and the one that Simon saved turns out to be the son of the ruling House named Jiriki. Together with An'nai, one of his kinsman, the Sitha prince joins their quest to the north and helps them survive several dangers. Eventually, Simon and his small company reach the icy mountains which are home to the powerful sword. Simon discovers the blade but shortly afterwards the troupe is attacked by a fierce iceworm, Igjarjuk. Simon, despite his fears, bravely tries to fight it off, suffering a wound in the process.\n\nAs the novel progresses, the narrative widens, giving the reader secondary viewpoints besides those of Simon. Some of the side stories, which have great importance nonetheless, include those of Isgrimnur, Duke of Rimmersgard; Maegwin, the daughter of the Hernystiri [[client king]]; and Tiamak, a scribe in the marshes of the distant South.\n\nMiriamele, the king's daughter, fled to her uncle in Naglimund. His protectiveness of her frustrates her however, so she flees Naglimund before its fall towards her kin in Nabban, intending to win their allegiance. A drunken monk named Cadrach travels with her; he has lots of secrets and a mysterious past. Isgrimmnur is sent after Miriamele to ensure her safety and return her to Josua.\n\nIn Hernystir, the king and his son are slain and their people driven into hiding in the mountains. There, Count Eolair attempts to assist Maegwin the king's daughter but she is sinking into madness while trying to find a way to save her people.\n\nThe book ends with the fall of Naglimund: after King Elias accepted the Storm King's terms and bargain, a host of Norns, giants, and undead servants of the Storm King arrive and utterly destroy the castle. Josua escapes with only 11 other people, amongst them Deornoth, his sworn sword, and Gutrun and Isorn, wife and son of Isgrimmnur. Simon opens his eyes after the dragon to find his face bearing a long burn scar and swath of hair turned white.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tadwilliams.com/ Tad Williams' web site]\n* {{isfdb title|2066}}\n* [http://www.fantasybooknews.com/2011/01/review-the-dragonbone-chair-by-tad-williams/ Review by J.K.

The bottom of the board is divided into 15 slots marked with various [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] amounts; eight of these range from $1 to $100 and remain constant throughout the game, while the others have higher values and increase from round to round. Seven numbered \"drop zones\" are centered at the top of the board (above the center seven slots), from which balls can be dropped into play.\n\nA team of two contestants plays each game, with a potential top prize of $12,374,994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wall|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-wall?nbc=1|website=NBC.com}}</ref><ref name=\"deadlinePremDate\">{{cite web|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=\u2018The Wall\u2019: NBC Sets Premiere Date For Game Show From EPs Chris Hardwick & LeBron James|url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/the-wall-premiere-date-nbc-game-show-lebron-james-chris-hardwick-1201854108/|website=Deadline|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=14 November 2016}}</ref> Green balls dropped on the board will add to the team's bank, while red balls dropped on the board will subtract from it. Throughout the game, the bank has a floor of $0.\n\n===Round 1: Free Fall===\nIn Free Fall, the team is asked a series of five questions, each with two answer choices. As each question is asked, three balls are simultaneously released from drop zones 1, 4, and 7. The team must select one answer and lock it in before the first ball crosses the threshold of a money slot. If the team's answer is correct, the balls turn green and their values are added to the team's bank. If the team answers incorrectly or fails to lock in an answer, the balls turn red and their values are subtracted from the team's bank.\n\nIf the team's bank balance is zero at the end of this round, the game is over and they leave without any winnings. If not, their earnings become part of a guaranteed payout to be offered to them at the end of the game. The highest amount that a team can bank in this round is $375,000.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $25,000, and are arranged as follows:\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $20,000 || $10 || $10,000 || $1 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$25,000''' || $1 || $10,000 || $10 || $20,000 || $100 || $5,000 || $1\n|}\n\n===Round 2===\nAt the start of the second round, the contestants are separated from each other for the remainder of the game. One enters an isolation chamber behind The Wall, while the other remains onstage. A set number of green balls are played simultaneously at the beginning of the round. Three multiple-choice questions are then played, each with three answer choices. The onstage player is shown only the answers to each question, and must decide which zone to use, based on how confident he/she is that the isolated player can answer correctly. The question and answers are then presented to the isolated player. After he/she responds, the ball is dropped from the chosen zone. A correct answer turns the ball green and adds the value of the slot it lands in to the team bank, while a wrong answer turns the ball red and deducts the value. The isolated player is not told which of his/her answers are correct or given any information on the team bank until they are brought out of isolation near the end of the game.\n\nThe onstage player is offered an opportunity to \"Double Up\" on the second question and \"Triple Up\" on the third. These options allow the onstage player to play two or three balls from the selected drop zone instead of one, respectively. After the third question, if the banked total is at least $1 more than the number of green balls played at the start of the round, an equal number of red balls are played simultaneously from the same zones.\n\nIn the first two seasons, two initial green balls were played from different zones chosen by the onstage player, and a team could bank up to $1,999,998. Beginning with the third season, seven initial green balls are played in a \"SuperDrop,\" one from every zone, and a team can bank up to $3,249,993.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $250,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $10,000 || $10 || $25,000 || $1 || $50,000 || $1 || $100,000 || $10 || $125,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$250,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Round 3===\nGameplay proceeds as in Round 2, but each of the three questions now has four answer choices. In addition, four green and four red balls are played at the start and end of the round respectively, and are dropped one at a time, rather than simultaneously. The \"Double Up\" and \"Triple Up\" options are available as before.\n\nThe maximum amount that a team can bank in this round is $9,999,996.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $1,000,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $50,000 || $100 || $100,000 || $10 || $200,000 || $1 || $300,000 || $1 || $400,000 || $10 || $500,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$1,000,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Final Decision===\nAfter the third question in Round 3, the isolated player is sent a contract by the host, and he/she must sign it or tear it up. Signing the contract gives up the team bank in favor of a guaranteed payout, equal to the Free Fall winnings plus an additional $20,000 for every question answered correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. If the isolated player tears up the contract, the team receives their final bank total instead. After the four red balls have dropped in Round 3 and the final bank is calculated (or after the last question if there is less than $5 banked), the isolated player returns to the stage to reveal his/her decision. Only at this point does he/she learn the number of correct answers given, the payout total, and the team's final bank.\n\nThe maximum possible guaranteed payout is $495,000, obtained by scoring $375,000 in Free Fall and answering all questions correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. The maximum possible bank total in the first two seasons is $12,374,994, obtained by answering every question correctly, using every Double Up and Triple Up option, having every green ball drop into the highest-valued slot, and having the six mandatory red balls each drop into a $1 slot. In the third season, the maximum possible total is $13,624,989 due to the number of mandatory green/red balls increasing to 11 each.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Wall'' has received mixed reviews by critics. Jan Chaney of ''Vulture'' dubbed ''The Wall'' as being \"the most stereotypically American game show on television right now\" and \"absurd yet undeniably diverting.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/01/wall-the-most-american-game-show-on-tv.html|title=The Wall Is the Most American Game Show on TV|date=2017-01-03|newspaper=Vulture|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Chaney criticized the show for making \"attempts to sell us something new, even though its concept is really based on old ideas [...] mixed up just enough [to] seem fresh\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBethonie Butler of the ''Chicago Tribune'' agreed that \"''The Wall'' looks a lot like the famed Plinko game from CBS\", but qualified that \"originality is relative when it comes to game shows\", remarking on the similarity between popular trivia game shows such as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

It premiered in January 2020. Telemundo's version of the game show is hosted by [[Marco Antonio Regil]].\n\nSeason 3 of the program premiered on March 15, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mitovich |first1=Matt Webb |title=NBC Sets Return Dates for The Wall (Finally!), \"Reimagined\" ''Little Big Shots'' |url=https://tvline.com/2020/02/12/the-wall-season-3-premiere-date-nbc/ |website=TVLine |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Wall is a four-storey-tall (40&nbsp;ft) pegboard, similar to a [[pachinko]] game or [[bean machine]]; it also is similar to the Plinko board used for the pricing game of the same name on ''[[The Price Is Right]]''. The bottom of the board is divided into 15 slots marked with various [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] amounts; eight of these range from $1 to $100 and remain constant throughout the game, while the others have higher values and increase from round to round. Seven numbered \"drop zones\" are centered at the top of the board (above the center seven slots), from which balls can be dropped into play.\n\nA team of two contestants plays each game, with a potential top prize of $12,374,994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wall|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-wall?nbc=1|website=NBC.com}}</ref><ref name=\"deadlinePremDate\">{{cite web|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=\u2018The Wall\u2019: NBC Sets Premiere Date For Game Show From EPs Chris Hardwick & LeBron James|url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/the-wall-premiere-date-nbc-game-show-lebron-james-chris-hardwick-1201854108/|website=Deadline|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=14 November 2016}}</ref> Green balls dropped on the board will add to the team's bank, while red balls dropped on the board will subtract from it. Throughout the game, the bank has a floor of $0.\n\n===Round 1: Free Fall===\nIn Free Fall, the team is asked a series of five questions, each with two answer choices. As each question is asked, three balls are simultaneously released from drop zones 1, 4, and 7. The team must select one answer and lock it in before the first ball crosses the threshold of a money slot. If the team's answer is correct, the balls turn green and their values are added to the team's bank. If the team answers incorrectly or fails to lock in an answer, the balls turn red and their values are subtracted from the team's bank.\n\nIf the team's bank balance is zero at the end of this round, the game is over and they leave without any winnings. If not, their earnings become part of a guaranteed payout to be offered to them at the end of the game. The highest amount that a team can bank in this round is $375,000.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $25,000, and are arranged as follows:\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $20,000 || $10 || $10,000 || $1 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$25,000''' || $1 || $10,000 || $10 || $20,000 || $100 || $5,000 || $1\n|}\n\n===Round 2===\nAt the start of the second round, the contestants are separated from each other for the remainder of the game. One enters an isolation chamber behind The Wall, while the other remains onstage. A set number of green balls are played simultaneously at the beginning of the round. Three multiple-choice questions are then played, each with three answer choices. The onstage player is shown only the answers to each question, and must decide which zone to use, based on how confident he/she is that the isolated player can answer correctly. The question and answers are then presented to the isolated player. After he/she responds, the ball is dropped from the chosen zone. A correct answer turns the ball green and adds the value of the slot it lands in to the team bank, while a wrong answer turns the ball red and deducts the value. The isolated player is not told which of his/her answers are correct or given any information on the team bank until they are brought out of isolation near the end of the game.\n\nThe onstage player is offered an opportunity to \"Double Up\" on the second question and \"Triple Up\" on the third. These options allow the onstage player to play two or three balls from the selected drop zone instead of one, respectively. After the third question, if the banked total is at least $1 more than the number of green balls played at the start of the round, an equal number of red balls are played simultaneously from the same zones.\n\nIn the first two seasons, two initial green balls were played from different zones chosen by the onstage player, and a team could bank up to $1,999,998. Beginning with the third season, seven initial green balls are played in a \"SuperDrop,\" one from every zone, and a team can bank up to $3,249,993.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $250,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $10,000 || $10 || $25,000 || $1 || $50,000 || $1 || $100,000 || $10 || $125,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$250,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Round 3===\nGameplay proceeds as in Round 2, but each of the three questions now has four answer choices. In addition, four green and four red balls are played at the start and end of the round respectively, and are dropped one at a time, rather than simultaneously. The \"Double Up\" and \"Triple Up\" options are available as before.\n\nThe maximum amount that a team can bank in this round is $9,999,996.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $1,000,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $50,000 || $100 || $100,000 || $10 || $200,000 || $1 || $300,000 || $1 || $400,000 || $10 || $500,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$1,000,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Final Decision===\nAfter the third question in Round 3, the isolated player is sent a contract by the host, and he/she must sign it or tear it up. Signing the contract gives up the team bank in favor of a guaranteed payout, equal to the Free Fall winnings plus an additional $20,000 for every question answered correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. If the isolated player tears up the contract, the team receives their final bank total instead. After the four red balls have dropped in Round 3 and the final bank is calculated (or after the last question if there is less than $5 banked), the isolated player returns to the stage to reveal his/her decision. Only at this point does he/she learn the number of correct answers given, the payout total, and the team's final bank.\n\nThe maximum possible guaranteed payout is $495,000, obtained by scoring $375,000 in Free Fall and answering all questions correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. The maximum possible bank total in the first two seasons is $12,374,994, obtained by answering every question correctly, using every Double Up and Triple Up option, having every green ball drop into the highest-valued slot, and having the six mandatory red balls each drop into a $1 slot. In the third season, the maximum possible total is $13,624,989 due to the number of mandatory green/red balls increasing to 11 each.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Wall'' has received mixed reviews by critics. Jan Chaney of ''Vulture'' dubbed ''The Wall'' as being \"the most stereotypically American game show on television right now\" and \"absurd yet undeniably diverting.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/01/wall-the-most-american-game-show-on-tv.html|title=The Wall Is the Most American Game Show on TV|date=2017-01-03|newspaper=Vulture|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Chaney criticized the show for making \"attempts to sell us something new, even though its concept is really based on old ideas [...] mixed up just enough [to] seem fresh\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBethonie Butler of the ''Chicago Tribune'' agreed that \"''The Wall'' looks a lot like the famed Plinko game from CBS\", but qualified that \"originality is relative when it comes to game shows\", remarking on the similarity between popular trivia game shows such as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The ATS began as a women's auxiliary in 1938. In 1941, the ATS was granted military status, although women received only [[Gender pay gap|two thirds of male pay]]. Women had a well-publicized role in handling anti-aircraft guns against German planes and [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1 missiles]].

An example of this is seen through Belle Royd. She began her career as a spy and messenger at the young age of 17. By the time she had become 20, she became quite famous in the United States in which people called her the Cleopatra of the Confederacy. As a spy, she provided confederate leaders with valuable information. She was arrested multiple times and put into prison. Eventually, she was banished from federal soil and was told she would receive a death sentence if she were caught on federal soil again.<ref>Jones, Shirley Farris. \"Civil War: Women Faced Danger in Roles as Spies.\" ''The Murfreesboro Post'', 23 March 2008.</ref>\nThose who fought in the war, disguised themselves as males, and went by men's aliases.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\">\"Female Soldiers in the Civil War.\" American Battlefield Trust, The History Channel, 15 Mar. 2018.</ref> It wasn't extremely difficult for women to conceal their true identities because soldiers showered separately and were fully clothed the majority of the time. In addition, both men and women would join the army with no previous military experience, so their training was very similar and the women would not stand out.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\"/>\nThe most common way for women to be discovered was through injury.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\"/> For instance, in 1861, [[Mary Owens]] enlisted into the Union Army disguised as the \"brother\" of William Evans, who was actually the love of her life. They could not stand to be separated. Her job was to deliver handwritten messages to commanders on the battlefield so that she would avoid combat. After her lover was killed in battle, Mary decided to avenge his death by fighting in the battlefield. She received a massive gash on her forehead for which she was sent to the hospital for treatment. It was during this moment that her female identity was revealed and she was discharged from the military.<ref>Grazier, Steven M. \"Mary Owens Jenkins Was Soldier in Union Army Disguised as a Man.\" ''Record-Courier'', Gatehouse Ohio Media, 29 May 2017.</ref> Those who were discovered would either be sent home or faced with punishment.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\"/> However, Mary was warmly welcomed back into her town.\nOther disguised were often uncovered by chance. [[Sarah Collins]] was a strong woman who believed she could do the job of a male soldier. Her brother, who was also a soldier, assisted her in disguising as a man by cutting her hair short and dressing her up in men's apparel. Unfortunately, her disguise was not perfect as her true identity was uncovered in the way she properly placed her shoe's that was unlike a male's method of placing shoes. Sarah was then sent home while her brother remained fighting.<ref>Heit, Judi. \"Soldier-Women of the America Civil War.\" Loreta Velazquez, 1 January 2011.</ref>\nIt is difficult for historians to accurately estimate the true number of women who fought in the war because of their disguise and aliases, as well as their desire of discretion. Women joined the fray of the Civil War for similar reasons as men: the promise of a steady wage, innate sense of patriotism, or for the thrill of an adventure. Some women would even follow their loved ones into battle.<ref>\nBlanton, DeAnne. \"Women Soldiers of the Civil War.\" National Archives and Records Administration, National Archives and Records Administration, 7 December 2017.</ref>\n\nIn 1917 [[Loretta Walsh]] became the first woman to enlist as a woman.

This committee additionally promoted nationality.  In addition to working for committees having to do with education, women worked in all sorts of positions. \u00a0Many women became [[YWCA USA|YWCA]] members and went overseas to help soldiers.

The ATS began as a women's auxiliary in 1938. In 1941, the ATS was granted military status, although women received only [[Gender pay gap|two thirds of male pay]]. Women had a well-publicized role in handling anti-aircraft guns against German planes and [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1 missiles]].

She was unhappy with her limited role in the [[American Revolution]]. She served in a light infantry unit, fighting in many battles. Injuries put her in a hospital where her secret was discovered. Her commanding officer, General John Paterson, honorably discharged her and thanked her for her service.<ref name=\"graduate.norwich.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://graduate.norwich.edu/resources-mmh/articles-mmh/how-roles-have-changed-for-women-in-the-military/|title=How Roles Have Changed for Women in the Military {{!}} Norwich Online Graduate Degrees|website=graduate.norwich.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>\n\nMany women contributed to the Civil War, whether it was through nursing, spying or physically fighting on the battlefield. An example of this is seen through Belle Royd. She began her career as a spy and messenger at the young age of 17. By the time she had become 20, she became quite famous in the United States in which people called her the Cleopatra of the Confederacy. As a spy, she provided confederate leaders with valuable information. She was arrested multiple times and put into prison. Eventually, she was banished from federal soil and was told she would receive a death sentence if she were caught on federal soil again.<ref>Jones, Shirley Farris. \"Civil War: Women Faced Danger in Roles as Spies.\" ''The Murfreesboro Post'', 23 March 2008.</ref>\nThose who fought in the war, disguised themselves as males, and went by men's aliases.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\">\"Female Soldiers in the Civil War.\" American Battlefield Trust, The History Channel, 15 Mar. 2018.</ref> It wasn't extremely difficult for women to conceal their true identities because soldiers showered separately and were fully clothed the majority of the time. In addition, both men and women would join the army with no previous military experience, so their training was very similar and the women would not stand out.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\"/>\nThe most common way for women to be discovered was through injury.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\"/> For instance, in 1861, [[Mary Owens]] enlisted into the Union Army disguised as the \"brother\" of William Evans, who was actually the love of her life. They could not stand to be separated. Her job was to deliver handwritten messages to commanders on the battlefield so that she would avoid combat. After her lover was killed in battle, Mary decided to avenge his death by fighting in the battlefield. She received a massive gash on her forehead for which she was sent to the hospital for treatment. It was during this moment that her female identity was revealed and she was discharged from the military.<ref>Grazier, Steven M. \"Mary Owens Jenkins Was Soldier in Union Army Disguised as a Man.\" ''Record-Courier'', Gatehouse Ohio Media, 29 May 2017.</ref> Those who were discovered would either be sent home or faced with punishment.<ref name=\"Civil War 2018\"/> However, Mary was warmly welcomed back into her town.\nOther disguised were often uncovered by chance. [[Sarah Collins]] was a strong woman who believed she could do the job of a male soldier. Her brother, who was also a soldier, assisted her in disguising as a man by cutting her hair short and dressing her up in men's apparel. Unfortunately, her disguise was not perfect as her true identity was uncovered in the way she properly placed her shoe's that was unlike a male's method of placing shoes. Sarah was then sent home while her brother remained fighting.<ref>Heit, Judi. \"Soldier-Women of the America Civil War.\" Loreta Velazquez, 1 January 2011.</ref>\nIt is difficult for historians to accurately estimate the true number of women who fought in the war because of their disguise and aliases, as well as their desire of discretion. Women joined the fray of the Civil War for similar reasons as men: the promise of a steady wage, innate sense of patriotism, or for the thrill of an adventure. Some women would even follow their loved ones into battle.<ref>\nBlanton, DeAnne. \"Women Soldiers of the Civil War.\" National Archives and Records Administration, National Archives and Records Administration, 7 December 2017.</ref>\n\nIn 1917 [[Loretta Walsh]] became the first woman to enlist as a woman.

It was the first of only two films directed by Roome (the other being the following year's comedy ''[[It's Not Cricket (1949 film)|It's Not Cricket]]'') during a long career as a film editor.  The film stars [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] and [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] and was produced by [[Sydney Box]].\n\n==Plot==\nHandcuffed together, George Martin ([[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]]) and Willie Stannard ([[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]]) are two prisoners being transported to [[prison]].  Martin is a hardened, cynical career criminal, while Stannard is a na\u00efve, rather dull-witted youth who has never previously been in trouble with the law, maintains his innocence of the [[rape]] for which he has been accused and is terrified by the prospect of prison.  During the journey the pair manage to escape.  Martin steals an army corporal's uniform and passes Stannard off as a [[deserter]] in his charge, being returned to face a military tribunal.\n\nThe escape location has been chosen by Martin for its proximity to a [[Garage (house)|garage]] run by his mistress Nora Lawrence ([[Jane Hylton]]), who provides the pair with overnight shelter.  The following day Martin and Stannard take refuge in a derelict isolated cottage.  While trying to file their handcuffs apart they are surprised by a hunting man with a gun.  A struggle ensues, during which Martin strikes and kills the man.  Shortly thereafter they manage to separate the handcuffs and Martin abandons Stannard, going on the run alone while Stannard gives himself up and is promptly charged with [[murder]].\n\nMartin manages to contact his wife in London, asking if she can find a way to get money to him.  She arranges to travel in a taxi driven by a friend of hers to the locality where he is hiding and to leave clothes and money for him at the barber's shop.  Just as she arrives, the police have tracked Martin down and have him cornered, halting her progress.  Rather than give himself up, Martin makes a final doomed attempt to escape through a warning-signed [[minefield]], watched by police, reporters, his wife and mistress and a crowd of sensation-seeking gawkers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as George Martin\n* [[Jane Hylton]] as Nora Lawrence\n* [[David Tomlinson]] as Ronnie Waring\n* [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Willie Stannard\n* [[Yvonne Owen]] as Meg Waring\n* [[Raymond Lovell]] as Bill Wainwright\n* [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as Syd Evans\n* [[Brenda Bruce]] as Winnie Foreman\n* [[Susan Shaw]] as Beryl\n* [[Beatrice Varley]] as Jenny Martin\n* [[Garry Marsh]] as Brewster\n* [[Maurice Denham]] as Superintendent Trent\n* [[Frederick Piper]] as Gordon\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Harding\n* [[John Boxer (British actor)|John Boxer]] as Police Sergeant Bert Foreman \n* [[Amy Veness]] as Mrs. Gully \n* [[Fred Groves (actor)|Fred Groves]] as Crown Hotel landlord \n* [[Arthur Hambling]] as Edward Hodges \n* [[Valentine Dyall]] as Inspector at Milton Wells \n* [[George Merritt (actor)|George Merritt]] as Constable at Milton Wells \n* [[Jack Raine]] as Chief Constable Col.

The film was based on a story by journalist Maurice Wiltshire, his first for the movies; it was the first screenplay for Frank Harvey, first credit as full producer for Anthony Yarnborough, first film for Alfred Roome, first film for the editor and cinematographer, and first starring role for George Cole.

The characterisation of the two main protagonists is praised for going deeper than the stereotypes of the tough, reckless criminal and the dim, hapless innocent.  Via the 1950 film ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'', and ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', the TV series developed from it which ran until the mid-1970s, Warner became forever engrained on the British consciousness as George \"Evenin' all\" Dixon, the avuncular upholder of law and order.  ''My Brother's Keeper'' is often cited as an example of the dramatic range of which Warner was capable, before he became typecast.  Cole's performance too is credited as one of the factors in his unusually smooth transition from child star to adult actor.  The film's main weakness is cited as the interpolation of a pseudo-comic and largely irrelevant subplot involving a newspaper reporter trying to cover the story while on honeymoon in the area; although this 'framing device' could also be likened to the 'comic relief' interludes found in Shakespearian - and other - tragedies which somehow both enhance and make bearable the serious 'meat' of the drama.\n\n===Box Office===\nThe film recorded a loss of \u00a39,400.<ref name=\"box\"/>\n\n==Location filming==\n''My Brother's Keeper'''s exterior location sequences were filmed in the [[Buckinghamshire]]/[[Oxfordshire]] border area, including scenes shot at the now abandoned [[Aston Rowant railway station]].\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]''\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title| 0040624 }}\n* {{AllMovie title| 127639 }}\n* {{BFI Screenonline title| 1082860 }}\n* {{BritMovie title| My-Brothers-Keeper }}\n*[https://archive.org/stream/variety171-1948-07#page/n123/mode/1up Review of film] at ''Variety''\n{{Gainsborough Pictures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:My Brother's Keeper}}\n[[Category:1948 films]]\n[[Category:1940s crime films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British crime films]]\n[[Category:Gainsborough Pictures films]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alfred Roome]]\n[[Category:1940s chase films]]\n[[Category:1948 directorial debut films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = My Brother's Keeper\n| image          = mbkposter1948.jpg\n| image_size     =\n| caption        = UK release poster\n| director       = [[Alfred Roome]]\n| producer       = [[Sydney Box]]\n| writer         = [[Frank Harvey (English screenwriter)|Frank Harvey]]\n| starring       = [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]]<br />[[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]]\n| music          = [[Clifton Parker]]\n| cinematography = Gordon Lang\n| editing        = Esmond Seal\n| studio         = [[Gainsborough Pictures]]\n| distributor = [[General Film Distributors]]\n| released       = 9 August 1948\n| runtime        = 96 minutes\n| country        = United Kingdom\n|budget = \u00a3113,600<ref name=\"box\">[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sY1LGFNtCOEC&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=sydney+box+film+producer&source=bl&ots=F02E_WOkLo&sig=bTwtFh0NIsHllgPcTGLkovJObNU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmkt78sr_MAhXltIMKHcEYCX0Q6AEILjAD#v=onepage&q=sydney%20box%20film%20producer&f=false Andrew Spicer, ''Sydney Box'' Manchester Uni Press 2006 p 210]</ref> or \u00a3100,000<ref>https://archive.org/stream/kinematographyea36unse#page/152/mode/1up/search/%22box+office%22</ref>\n|gross = \u00a393,600 (by Dec 1949)<ref name=\"box\"/>\n| language       = English\n}}\n\n'''''My Brother's Keeper''''' is a 1948 British crime film in the form of a convicts-on-the-run chase thriller, directed by [[Alfred Roome]] for [[Gainsborough Pictures]].

In 1848, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, passed a resolution in favor of women's suffrage despite opposition from some of its organizers, who believed the idea was too extreme.  By the time of the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1850, however, suffrage was becoming an increasingly important aspect of the movement's activities.\n\nThe first national [[suffrage]] organizations were established in 1869 when two competing organizations were formed, one led by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and the other by [[Lucy Stone]].  After years of rivalry, they merged in 1890 as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) with Anthony as its leading force.

Anthony actually succeeded in voting in 1872 but was arrested for that act and found guilty in a widely publicized trial that gave the movement fresh momentum.  After the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled against them in the 1875 case ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'', suffragists began the decades-long campaign for an amendment to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] women.  Much of the movement's energy, however, went toward working for suffrage on a state-by-state basis.\n\nIn 1916 [[Alice Paul]] formed the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), a militant group focused on the passage of a national suffrage amendment. Over 200 NWP supporters, the [[Silent Sentinels]], were arrested in 1917 while picketing the [[White House]], some of whom went on [[hunger strike]] and endured [[Force-feeding|forced feeding]] after being sent to prison.  Under the leadership of [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], the two-million-member NAWSA also made a national suffrage amendment its top priority.  After a hard-fought series of votes in the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 18, 1920.<ref>{{ cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/amendment-19 | title=The 19th Amendment | publisher=National Archives | date=May 16, 2019 | accessdate=May 31, 2019 }}</ref>  It states, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\"\n\n==National history==\n{{See also|Women's suffrage in states of the United States}}\n\n===Early voting activity===\n\n[[Lydia Taft]] (1712\u20131778), a wealthy widow, was allowed to vote in town meetings in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1756.<ref name=\"address\">{{cite book|last= Chapin |first= Judge Henry|authorlink=|title=Address Delivered at the Unitarian Church in Uxbridge, 1864|pages= 172|year= 1881|location=Worcester, Massachusetts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ua-pgcKRY2QC&pg=PA172}}</ref> No other women in the colonial era are known to have voted.\n\nThe [[New Jersey]] constitution of 1776 enfranchised all adult inhabitants who owned a specified amount of property.

One barrier was strong opposition to women's involvement in public affairs, a practice that was not fully accepted even among reform activists.  Only after fierce debate were women accepted as members of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] at its convention of 1839, and the organization split at its next convention when women were appointed to committees.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 40, 45</ref>\n\nOpposition was especially strong against the idea of women speaking to audiences of both men and women. [[Frances Wright]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] woman, was subjected to sharp criticism for delivering public lectures in the U.S. in 1826 and 1827. When the [[Grimk\u00e9 sisters]], who had been born into a slave-holding family in [[South Carolina]], spoke against slavery throughout the northeast in the mid-1830s, the ministers of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], a major force in that region, published a statement condemning their actions.

Early female speakers included [[Ernestine Rose]], a Jewish immigrant from Poland; Lucretia Mott, a [[Quaker]] minister and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]; and [[Abby Kelley Foster]], a Quaker abolitionist.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA40 p. 40]</ref> \nToward the end of the 1840s [[Lucy Stone]] launched her career as a public speaker, soon becoming the most famous female lecturer.<ref>McMillen (2008), p. 120</ref>\nSupporting both the abolitionist and women's rights movements, Stone played a major role in reducing the prejudice against women speaking in public.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 1, 91\u201392</ref>\n\nOpposition remained strong, however. A regional women's rights convention in Ohio in 1851 was disrupted by male opponents.

According to [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', an authoritative commentary on the [[English common law]] on which the American legal system is modeled, \"by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage\",<ref>Quoted in Gordon (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjq1rbyN_IQC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref> referring to the legal doctrine of [[coverture]] that was introduced to England by the [[Normans]] in the [[Middle Ages]].

Many of its activists were aligned with the [[William Lloyd Garrison|Garrisonian]] wing of the abolitionist movement, which believed that activists should avoid political activity and focus instead on convincing others of their views with \"moral suasion\".<ref>Wellman (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&pg=PA45 p.45]</ref>\nMany were Quakers whose traditions barred both men and women from participation in secular political activity.<ref>Wellman (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&pg=PA204 p. 204]</ref>\nA series of women's rights conventions did much to alter these attitudes.\n\n==== Seneca Falls convention ====\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]\n\nThe first women's rights convention was the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], a regional event held on July 19 and 20, 1848, in [[Seneca Falls (hamlet), New York|Seneca Falls]] in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Five women called the convention, four of whom were [[Quaker views on women|Quaker social activists]], including the well-known [[Lucretia Mott]]. The fifth was [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who had discussed the need to organize for women's rights with Mott several years earlier.<ref>McMillen (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TzVRlFXiYswC&pg=PA3 pp. 3, 72, 77, 84]</ref>\nStanton, who came from a family that was deeply involved in politics, became a major force in convincing the women's movement that political pressure was crucial to its goals, and that the right to vote was a key weapon.<ref>Dubois, ed.

When her husband, a well-known social reformer, learned that she intended to introduce this resolution, he refused to attend the convention and accused her of acting in a way that would turn the proceedings into a farce. Lucretia Mott, the main speaker, was also disturbed by the proposal. The resolution was adopted only after [[Frederick Douglass]], an abolitionist leader and a former slave, gave it his strong support.<ref>Wellman (2004), \n[https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&pg=PA193 pp. 193, 195, 203]</ref>\nThe convention's [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which was written primarily by Stanton, expressed an intent to build a women's rights movement, and it included a list of grievances, the first two of which protested the lack of women's suffrage.<ref>McMillen (2008), pp. 88\u201389, 238\u201339</ref> The grievances which were aimed at the United States government \"demanded government reform and changes in male roles and behaviors that promoted inequality for women.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/expref/crusader/seneca.html|title=Seneca Falls Convention - American Memory Timeline- Classroom Presentation|last=|first=|date=|website=Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis convention was followed two weeks later by the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848]], which featured many of the same speakers and likewise voted to support women's suffrage.

Its drive for [[universal suffrage]], however, was resisted by some abolitionist leaders and their allies in the [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who wanted women to postpone their campaign for suffrage until it had first been achieved for male African Americans. [[Horace Greeley]], a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, \"This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is 'the negro's hour,' and your first duty now is to go through the State and plead his claims.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/270/mode/2up p. 270]. Greeley was referring to the 1867 AERA campaign in New York State for women's suffrage and the removal of discriminatory property requirements for black voters.</ref>\nThey and others, including Lucy Stone, refused to postpone their demands, however, and continued to push for [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn April 1867 Stone and her husband [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] opened the AERA campaign in [[Kansas]] in support of [[referendum|referenda]] in that state that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] both African Americans and women.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/232/mode/2up p. 232]</ref>\n[[Wendell Phillips]], an abolitionist leader who opposed mixing those two causes, surprised and angered AERA workers by blocking the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA105 p. 105]</ref>\nAfter an internal struggle, Kansas Republicans decided to support suffrage for black men only and formed an \"Anti-Female Suffrage Committee\" to oppose the AERA's efforts.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA124 pp. 124, 127]</ref> \nBy the end of summer the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted.\nAnthony and Stanton were harshly criticized by Stone and other AERA members for accepting help during the last days of the campaign from [[George Francis Train]], a wealthy businessman who supported women's rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party, which had won the loyalty of many reform activists,  and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA93 pp. 92\u201394].</ref>\n\nAfter the Kansas campaign, the AERA increasingly divided into two wings, both advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first, if necessary, and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Anthony and Stanton, insisted that women and black men be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a politically independent women's movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists for financial and other resources. \nThe acrimonious annual meeting of the AERA in May 1869 signaled the effective demise of the organization, in the aftermath of which two competing woman suffrage organizations were created.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA80 pp. 80\u201381, 189, 196]. The AERA held no further annual meetings and went out of existence a year later.

In November 1869, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Julia Ward Howe]], [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] and others, many of whom had helped to create the New England Woman Suffrage Association a year earlier, formed the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA).  The hostile rivalry between these two organizations created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades, affecting even professional historians of the women's movement.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA173 pp. 173, 189, 196].</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick Douglass as a younger man.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Douglass]]\n\nThe immediate cause for the split was the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], a [[reconstruction amendments|reconstruction amendment]] that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. Stanton and Anthony opposed its passage unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA47 p. 47]</ref>\nThey said that by effectively [[suffrage|enfranchising]] all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an \"aristocracy of sex\" by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA185 pp. 174\u201375, 185]</ref>\nMale power and privilege was at the root of society's ills, Stanton argued, and nothing should be done to strengthen it.<ref name=\"Rakow-48\">Rakow and Kramarae eds.

[[Frederick Douglass]], a strong supporter of women's suffrage, said, \"The race to which I belong have not generally taken the right ground on this question.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=The Anniversaries |newspaper=New York Tribune |date=May 15, 1868}} Quoted in Dudden (2011), p. 149.</ref>\nDouglass, however, strongly supported the amendment, saying it was a matter of life and death for former slaves.  Lucy Stone, who became the AWSA's most prominent leader, supported the amendment but said she believed that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/382/mode/2up pp. 382\u2013384].

The 1869 AERA annual meeting voted to endorse the Fifteenth Amendment.</ref>\n\nBoth wings of the movement were strongly associated with opposition to slavery, but their leaders sometimes expressed views that reflected the racial attitudes of that era. Stanton, for example, believed that a long process of education would be needed before what she called the \"lower orders\" of former slaves and immigrant workers would be able to participate meaningfully as voters.<ref name=\"Rakow-48\"/>\nIn an article in ''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'', Stanton wrote, \"American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.\"<ref>Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \"The Sixteenth Amendment,\" ''The Revolution'', April 29, 1869, p. 266.

That did not happen; the high point of Republican support was a non-committal reference to women's suffrage in the 1872 Republican platform.</ref> \nThe NWSA, while determined to be politically independent, was critical of the Republicans. Anthony and Stanton wrote a letter to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]] that criticized Republican sponsorship of the [[Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (which granted citizenship to black men but for the first time introduced the word \"male\" into the Constitution), saying, \"While the dominant party has with one hand lifted up two million black men and crowned them with the honor and dignity of citizenship, with the other it has dethroned fifteen million white women\u2014their own mothers and sisters, their own wives and daughters\u2014and cast them under the heel of the lowest orders of manhood.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/340/mode/2up p. 341].

Although each campaigned for suffrage at both the state and national levels, the NWSA tended to work more at the national level and the AWSA more at the state level.<ref>Scott and Scott (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA17 p. 17]</ref>\nThe NWSA initially worked on a wider range of issues than the AWSA, including divorce reform and [[equal pay for women]].

In 1870 debate about the Fifteenth Amendment was made irrelevant when that amendment was officially ratified. In 1872 disgust with corruption in government led to a mass defection of abolitionists and other social reformers from the Republicans to the short-lived [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]].<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA200 pp. 166, 200]</ref>\nThe rivalry between the two women's groups was so bitter, however, that a merger proved to be impossible until 1890.\n\n===New Departure===\n\nIn 1869 Francis and [[Virginia Minor]], husband and wife suffragists from Missouri, outlined a strategy that came to be known as the New Departure, which engaged the suffrage movement for several years.<ref>DuBois (1998), pp. 98\u201399, 117</ref>\nArguing that the U.S. Constitution implicitly enfranchised women, this strategy relied heavily on Section 1 of the recently adopted [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]],<ref name=fjc-trial-narrative>{{cite web |url= http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_anthony_narrative.html |title=The Trial of Susan B.

Soon hundreds of women tried to vote in dozens of localities.\nIn some cases, actions like these preceded the New Departure strategy: in 1868 in Vineland, New Jersey, a center for radical [[spiritualism|spiritualists]], nearly 200 women placed their ballots into a separate box and attempted to have them counted, but without success. The AWSA did not officially adopt the New Departure strategy, but [[Lucy Stone]], its leader, attempted to vote in her home town in New Jersey.<ref>DuBois (1998), pp. 100, 119, 120</ref>\nIn one court case resulting from a lawsuit brought by women who had been prevented from voting, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., ruled that women did not have an implicit right to vote, declaring that, \"The fact that the practical working of the assumed right would be destructive of civilization is decisive that the right does not exist.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/598/mode/2up p. 599]</ref>\n\nIn 1871 [[Victoria Woodhull]], a stockbroker, was invited to speak before a committee of Congress, the first woman to do so. Although she had little previous connection to the women's movement, she presented a modified version of the New Departure strategy. Instead of asking the courts to declare that women had the right to vote, she asked Congress itself to declare that the Constitution implicitly enfranchised women. The committee rejected her suggestion.<ref>DuBois (1998), pp. 100, 122</ref>\nThe NWSA at first reacted enthusiastically to Woodhull's sudden appearance on the scene.  Stanton in particular welcomed Woodhull's proposal to assemble a broad-based reform party that would support women's suffrage.  Anthony opposed that idea, wanting the NWSA to remain politically independent.  The NWSA soon had reason to regret its association with Woodhull. In 1872 she published details of a purported adulterous affair between Rev. [[Henry Ward Beecher]], president of the AWSA, and Elizabeth Tilton, wife of a leading NWSA member.<ref>DuBois, ed.

Originally envisioned as a modest publication that would be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years. Susan B. Anthony had been collecting material, such as newspaper articles and reports, during her time as a women's rights activist. Due to the amount of work required from the project, Susan B. Anthony would take their belonging, and materials related to their research to Stanton's household in 1876. Reviewing their past efforts was a strenuous activity for Anthony, as each letter or article gave her less hope that they'll be able to complete this retelling of history.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harper |first1=Ida Husted |title=The Life and Work of Susan B.

Lucy Stone is known to have little interest in Anthony and Stanton's book because she believed that history should be refrained from being recorded by the parties involved.

Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press. {{ISBN|0-87049-836-3}}</ref> Work at the state level, however, also had its frustrations. Between 1870 and 1910, the suffrage movement conducted 480 campaigns in 33 states just to have the issue of women's suffrage brought before the voters, and those campaigns resulted in only 17 instances of the issue actually being placed on the ballot.<ref>Flexner (1959), p. 213</ref> These efforts led to women's suffrage in two states, Colorado and Idaho.\n\n[[Alice Stone Blackwell]], daughter of AWSA leaders Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell, was a major influence in bringing the rival suffrage leaders together, proposing a joint meeting in 1887 to discuss a merger. Anthony and Stone favored the idea, but opposition from several NWSA veterans delayed the move. In 1890 the two organizations merged as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).<ref>Dubois, ed. (1992) pp. 178\u201380</ref> Stanton was president of the new organization, and Stone was chair of its executive committee, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice, becoming president herself in 1892 when Stanton retired.<ref>McMillen (2008), pp. 228, 231</ref>\n\n===National American Woman Suffrage Association===\n\nAlthough Anthony was the leading force in the newly merged organization, it did not always follow her lead.  In 1893 the NAWSA voted over Anthony's objection to alternate the site of its annual conventions between Washington and various other parts of the country.  Anthony's pre-merger NWSA had always held its conventions in Washington to help maintain focus on a national suffrage amendment.  Arguing against this decision, she said she feared, accurately as it turned out, that the NAWSA would engage in suffrage work at the state level at the expense of national work.<ref>Flexner (1959), pp. 212\u201313</ref>\n\nStanton, elderly but still very much a radical, did not fit comfortably into the new organization, which was becoming more conservative. In 1895 she published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', a controversial best-seller that attacked the use of the [[Bible]] to relegate women to an inferior status. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with the book despite Anthony's objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful. Stanton afterwards grew increasingly alienated from the suffrage movement.<ref>Dubois, ed.

Catt began revitalizing the organization, establishing a plan of work with clear goals for every state every year. Anthony was impressed and arranged for Catt to succeed her when she retired from the presidency of the NAWSA in 1900. In her new post Catt continued her effort to transform the unwieldy organization into one that would be better prepared to lead a major suffrage campaign.<ref>Scott and Scott (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA24 pp. 24\u201325]</ref>\n\nCatt noted the rapidly growing  [[woman's club|women's club]] movement, which was taking up some of the slack left by the decline of the temperance movement.  Local women's clubs at first were mostly reading groups focused on literature, but they increasingly evolved into civic improvement organizations of middle-class women meeting in each other's homes weekly. Their national organization was the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC), founded in 1890. The clubs avoided controversial issues that would divide the membership, especially religion and prohibition.  In the South and East, suffrage was also highly divisive, while there was little resistance to it among clubwomen in the West.  In the Midwest, clubwomen had first avoided the suffrage issue out of caution, but after 1900 increasingly came to support it.<ref>Stephen M. Buechler, ''The Transformation of the Woman Suffrage Movement: The Case of Illinois, 1850-1920'' (1986) pp 154-57</ref> Catt implemented what was known as the \"society plan,\" a successful effort to recruit wealthy members of the women's club movement whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement.<ref>Graham (1996), pp. 36\u201337</ref>   By 1914 women's suffrage was endorsed by the national General Federation of Women's Clubs.<ref>Dubois, ed.

Authorized by the NAWSA to name her own executive board, which previously had been elected by the organization's annual convention, Catt quickly converted the loosely structured organization into one that was highly centralized.<ref>Graham (1996), pp. 81, 86</ref>\n\n===''MacKenzie v.

Society women in particular had personal access to powerful politicians, and were reluctant to surrender that advantage.

Its credo, as set down by its president [[Josephine Jewell Dodge]], was:\n\n<blockquote>We believe in every possible advancement to women.  We believe that this advancement should be along those legitimate lines of work and endeavor for which she is best fitted and for which she has now unlimited opportunities.  We believe this advancement will be better achieved through strictly non-partisan effort and without the limitations of the ballot.

They were very similar to the suffragists themselves, but used a counter-crusading style warning of the evils that suffrage would bring to women. They rejected leadership by men and stressed the importance of independent women in philanthropy and social betterment.  NYSAOWS was narrowly defeated in New York in 1916 and the state voted to give women the vote. The organization moved to Washington to oppose the federal constitutional amendment for suffrage, becoming the \"National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage\" (NAOWS), where it was taken over by men, and assumed a much harsher rhetorical tone, especially in attacking \"red radicalism\".

Green, ''Southern Strategies: Southern Women and the Woman Suffrage Question'' (1997) p 52</ref>\n\n[[Henry Browne Blackwell]], an officer of the AWSA before the merger and a prominent figure in the movement afterwards, urged the suffrage movement to follow a strategy of convincing southern political leaders that they could ensure [[white supremacy]] in their region without violating the Fifteenth Amendment by enfranchising educated women, who would predominantly be white. Shortly after Blackwell presented his proposal to the [[Mississippi]] delegation to the U.S. Congress, his plan was given serious consideration by the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1890, whose main purpose was to find legal ways of further curtailing the political power of African Americans.  Although the convention adopted other measures instead, the fact that Blackwell's ideas were taken seriously drew the interest of many suffragists.<ref>Wheeler (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA113 pp. 113\u201314]</ref>\n\nBlackwell's ally in this effort was [[Laura Clay]], who convinced the NAWSA to launch a state-by-state campaign in the South based on Blackwell's strategy.  Clay was one of several southern NAWSA members who opposed the idea of a national women's suffrage amendment on the grounds that it would impinge on [[states' rights]].  (A generation later Clay campaigned against the pending national amendment during the final battle for its ratification.) Amid predictions by some proponents of this strategy that the South would lead the way in the enfranchisement of women, suffrage organizations were established throughout the region.  Anthony, Catt and Blackwell campaigned for suffrage in the South in 1895, with the latter two calling for suffrage only for educated women.  With Anthony's reluctant cooperation, the NAWSA maneuvered to accommodate the politics of white supremacy in that region.  Anthony asked her old friend Frederick Douglass, a former slave, not to attend the NAWSA convention in Atlanta in 1895, the first to be held in a southern city.  Black NAWSA members were excluded from 1903 convention in the southern city of New Orleans, which marked the peak of this strategy's influence.<ref>Wheeler (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA114 pp.114\u201318, 177]</ref>\n\nThe leaders of the Southern movement were privileged upper-class belles with a strong position in high society and in church affairs.

Maud Wood Park had realized that women on college campuses had little interest or appreciation for the grueling decades of dedication Susan B.

Interest in a national suffrage amendment was revived primarily by [[Alice Paul]].<ref name=Gordon-in-Wheeler/> In 1910, she returned to the U.S. from England, where she had been part of the militant wing of the suffrage movement. Paul had been jailed there and had endured [[force-feeding|forced feedings]] after going on a hunger strike. In January 1913 she arrived in Washington as chair of the Congressional Committee of the NAWSA, charged with reviving the drive for a constitutional amendment that would enfranchise women. She and her coworker [[Lucy Burns]] organized a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s inauguration as president. Opponents of the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order. Public outrage over the incident, which cost the chief of police his job, brought publicity to the movement and gave it fresh momentum.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA256 pp. 255\u201357]</ref> In 1914 Paul and her followers began referring to the proposed suffrage amendment as the \"Susan B.

She and Burns formed a separate [[lobbying]] group called the [[Congressional Union]] to act on this approach.

The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect [[Al Smith]], while rural drys mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican [[Herbert Hoover]].  Catholic women were reluctant to vote in the early 1920s, but they registered in very large numbers for the 1928 election\u2014the first in which Catholicism was a major issue.<ref>Allan J. Lichtman, ''Prejudice and the Old Politics: The Presidential Election of 1928'' (1979)</ref>  A few women were elected to office, but none became especially prominent during this time period. Overall, the women's rights movement declined noticeably during the 1920s.\n\n====In U. S. territories====\nAt the time the 19th Amendment was passed, both [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] were territories of the United States.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=48}} Suffragists believed that women in the Virgin Islands had been enfranchised when the Danish extended suffrage in 1915, as at that time the [[Danish West Indies]] were their possession. Similarly, as Puerto Ricans were confirmed to be U. S. citizens in 1917, it was assumed that suffrage had been extended there as well with the passage of the 19th Amendment.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=49}} Upon questioning its applicability in Puerto Rico, Governor [[Arthur Yager]] received clarification from the [[Bureau of Insular Affairs]] that passage or ratification in the states would not grant women's suffrage in Puerto Rico, because of the [[Political status of Puerto Rico|island's unincorporated status]].{{sfn|Clark|1975|p=43}} In 1921, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that constitutional rights did not extend to residents in the two territories as they were defined in Puerto Rico by the [[Foraker Act|Organic Act of 1900]] and in the Virgin Islands by the Danish Colonial Law of 1906.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=49}}\n\nSuffragists and their supporters unsuccessfully introduced enfranchisement bills to the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|insular legislature]] in Puerto Rico in 1919, 1921, and 1923.{{sfn|Clark|1975|p=42}} In 1924, [[Milagros Benet de Mewton]] sued the electoral board for refusing to allow her to register.{{sfn|Torres Rivera|2009}}{{sfn|Rivera L\u00f3pez|2016|pp=536\u2013537}} Her case argued that as a U.S. citizen, she should be allowed to vote in accordance with the U.S. Constitution,{{sfn|Rivera Lass\u00e9n|2010|pp=42\u201343}} because territorial law was not allowed to contravene U.S. law. The [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]] ruled that the electoral law was not discriminatory because Puerto Ricans were not allowed to vote for federal electors,{{sfn|Rivera L\u00f3pez|2016|pp=525\u2013526}} and that the territory, like U.S. states, retained the right to define who was eligible to vote.{{sfn|Rivera Lass\u00e9n|2010|p=43}} Another failed bill, in 1927, led Benet and women involved in the Pan-American Women's Association to press the US Congress to enfranchise Puerto Rican women.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=50}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hull |first1=Harwood |title=Porto Rican Women Ask Aid of Congress in Getting Vote |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39101162/the_indianapolis_star/ |accessdate=17 November 2019 |date=28 May 1928 |newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |page=27 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> When in 1928, the bill passed out of committee and was scheduled for a vote the U. S. House of Representatives, the Puerto Rican legislature realized that if they did not extend suffrage the federal government would. They passed a limited suffrage bill on 16 April 1929 limiting voting rights to literate women.{{sfn|Clark|1975|pp=43-45}} Universal suffrage was finally achieved in Puerto Rico in 1936, when a bill submitted by the Socialist Party the previous year, gained approval in the insular legislature.{{sfn|Roy-F\u00e9qui\u00e8re|2004|p=75}}\n\nIn the Virgin Islands, voting was restricted to men who were literate and owned property. Teachers like [[Edith Williams (suffragist)|Edith Williams]] and Mildred V. Anduze pressed for women to gain the vote.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1987|pp=58-59}} In 1935 the [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] Teachers' Association filed a lawsuit challenging the applicability of the 19th amendment to Virgin Islanders. In November 1935, the court ruled that the Danish Colonial Law was unconstitutional as it conflicted with the 19th Amendment{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=53}} and that it had not been the intent to limit the franchise to men. To test the law, Williams attempted to register to vote and encouraged other teachers to do so, but their applications were refused. Williams, Eulalie Stevens and Anna M. Vessup, all literate, property owners, petitioned the court to open elections to qualified women.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1987|pp=59-60}} Judge [[Albert L\u00e9vitt]] ruled in favor of the women on 27 December, which led to mobilization to register to vote in [[Saint Croix]] and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]].{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=53}}\n\n====Changes in the voting population====\nAlthough restricting access to the polls because of sex was made unconstitutional in 1920, women did not turn out to the polls in the same numbers as men until 1980. A term commonly used that represents the push for equal representation in government is known as Mirror Representation. The amount of representation of sex in government should match the portion of that specific sex in the population. From 1980 until the present, women have voted in elections in at least the same percentage as have men, and often more. This difference in voting turnout and preferences between men and women is known as the [[voting gender gap]]. The voting gender gap has impacted political elections and, consequently, the way candidates campaign for office.\n\n====Changes in representation and government programs====\nAfter women gained the right to vote, the presence of women in Congress gradually increased since 1920, with an especially steady increase from 1981.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Today, women increasingly pursue politics as a career.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} At the state and national level, women have brought attention to gender-sensitive topics, gender equality, and children's rights.

The [[Sheppard\u2013Towner Act|Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921]], which expanded maternity care during the 1920s, was one of the first laws passed appealing to the female vote.<ref>Lynn Dumenil, ''The Modern Temper: American Culture and Society in the 1920s'', Hill and Wang, (1995)</ref>\n\n====Socio-economic effects====\nA paper by [[John Lott]] and Lawrence W. Kenny, published by the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', found that women generally voted along more [[liberalism|liberal]] political philosophies than men.  The paper concluded that women's voting appeared to be more risk-averse than men and favored candidates or policies that supported [[Redistribution of income and wealth|wealth transfer]], [[social insurance]], [[progressive taxation]], and larger government.<ref>[[John Lott|Lott, John]] and Lawrence W.

In 1848, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, passed a resolution in favor of women's suffrage despite opposition from some of its organizers, who believed the idea was too extreme.  By the time of the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1850, however, suffrage was becoming an increasingly important aspect of the movement's activities.\n\nThe first national [[suffrage]] organizations were established in 1869 when two competing organizations were formed, one led by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and the other by [[Lucy Stone]].  After years of rivalry, they merged in 1890 as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) with Anthony as its leading force. The [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), which was the largest women's organization at that time, was established in 1873 and also pursued women's suffrage, giving a huge boost to the movement.<ref name=\"MarionOliver2014\">{{cite book |last1=Marion |first1=Nancy E. |last2=Oliver |first2=Willard M. |title=Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law |date=2014 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781610695961 |pages=963 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=\"Burlingame2004\">{{cite book |last1=Burlingame |first1=Dwight |title=Philanthropy in America: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia |date=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781576078600 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/philanthropyinam00sant/page/511 511] |language=English |url=https://archive.org/details/philanthropyinam00sant/page/511 }}</ref>\n\nHoping that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] would rule that [[women]] had a constitutional right to vote, suffragists made several attempts to vote in the early 1870s and then filed [[lawsuits]] when they were turned away.  Anthony actually succeeded in voting in 1872 but was arrested for that act and found guilty in a widely publicized trial that gave the movement fresh momentum.  After the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled against them in the 1875 case ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'', suffragists began the decades-long campaign for an amendment to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] women.  Much of the movement's energy, however, went toward working for suffrage on a state-by-state basis.\n\nIn 1916 [[Alice Paul]] formed the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), a militant group focused on the passage of a national suffrage amendment. Over 200 NWP supporters, the [[Silent Sentinels]], were arrested in 1917 while picketing the [[White House]], some of whom went on [[hunger strike]] and endured [[Force-feeding|forced feeding]] after being sent to prison.  Under the leadership of [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], the two-million-member NAWSA also made a national suffrage amendment its top priority.  After a hard-fought series of votes in the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 18, 1920.<ref>{{ cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/amendment-19 | title=The 19th Amendment | publisher=National Archives | date=May 16, 2019 | accessdate=May 31, 2019 }}</ref>  It states, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\"\n\n==National history==\n{{See also|Women's suffrage in states of the United States}}\n\n===Early voting activity===\n\n[[Lydia Taft]] (1712\u20131778), a wealthy widow, was allowed to vote in town meetings in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1756.<ref name=\"address\">{{cite book|last= Chapin |first= Judge Henry|authorlink=|title=Address Delivered at the Unitarian Church in Uxbridge, 1864|pages= 172|year= 1881|location=Worcester, Massachusetts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ua-pgcKRY2QC&pg=PA172}}</ref> No other women in the colonial era are known to have voted.\n\nThe [[New Jersey]] constitution of 1776 enfranchised all adult inhabitants who owned a specified amount of property.

One barrier was strong opposition to women's involvement in public affairs, a practice that was not fully accepted even among reform activists.  Only after fierce debate were women accepted as members of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] at its convention of 1839, and the organization split at its next convention when women were appointed to committees.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 40, 45</ref>\n\nOpposition was especially strong against the idea of women speaking to audiences of both men and women. [[Frances Wright]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] woman, was subjected to sharp criticism for delivering public lectures in the U.S. in 1826 and 1827. When the [[Grimk\u00e9 sisters]], who had been born into a slave-holding family in [[South Carolina]], spoke against slavery throughout the northeast in the mid-1830s, the ministers of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], a major force in that region, published a statement condemning their actions. Despite the disapproval, in 1838 [[Angelina Grimk\u00e9]] spoke against slavery before the Massachusetts legislature, the first woman in the U.S. to speak before a legislative body.<ref>Flexner (1959),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA46 pp. 25\u201326, 42, 45\u201346]</ref>\n\nOther women began to give public speeches, especially in opposition to slavery and in support of [[women's rights]]. Early female speakers included [[Ernestine Rose]], a Jewish immigrant from Poland; Lucretia Mott, a [[Quaker]] minister and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]; and [[Abby Kelley Foster]], a Quaker abolitionist.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA40 p. 40]</ref> \nToward the end of the 1840s [[Lucy Stone]] launched her career as a public speaker, soon becoming the most famous female lecturer.<ref>McMillen (2008), p. 120</ref>\nSupporting both the abolitionist and women's rights movements, Stone played a major role in reducing the prejudice against women speaking in public.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 1, 91\u201392</ref>\n\nOpposition remained strong, however. A regional women's rights convention in Ohio in 1851 was disrupted by male opponents. [[Sojourner Truth]], who delivered her famous speech \"[[Ain't I a Woman?]]\" at the convention, directly addressed some of this opposition in her speech.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA85 p. 85]</ref> \nThe [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1852 was also disrupted, and mob action at the 1853 convention came close to violence.<ref>McMillen (2008), pp. 117\u201318</ref>\nThe World's Temperance Convention in New York City in 1853 bogged down for three days in a dispute about whether women would be allowed to speak there.<ref>Harper (1898\u20131908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n151/mode/2up, pp. 101\u201303]</ref>\n[[Susan B. Anthony]], a leader of the suffrage movement, later said, \"No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public. For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonized.\"<ref>Susan B.

New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-8129-2430-4}}</ref>\n\nLaws that sharply restricted the independent activity of married women also created barriers to the campaign for women's suffrage. According to [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', an authoritative commentary on the [[English common law]] on which the American legal system is modeled, \"by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage\",<ref>Quoted in Gordon (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjq1rbyN_IQC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref> referring to the legal doctrine of [[coverture]] that was introduced to England by the [[Normans]] in the [[Middle Ages]].

Gerrit Smith was a cousin and close friend of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]. Wellman says they spurred each other to develop ideas of inclusive politics and to publicly advocate voting rights for women, which Smith did before Stanton.</ref>\n\n===Early women's rights conventions===\n\nWomen's suffrage was not a major topic within the women's rights movement at that point.  Many of its activists were aligned with the [[William Lloyd Garrison|Garrisonian]] wing of the abolitionist movement, which believed that activists should avoid political activity and focus instead on convincing others of their views with \"moral suasion\".<ref>Wellman (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&pg=PA45 p.45]</ref>\nMany were Quakers whose traditions barred both men and women from participation in secular political activity.<ref>Wellman (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&pg=PA204 p. 204]</ref>\nA series of women's rights conventions did much to alter these attitudes.\n\n==== Seneca Falls convention ====\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]\n\nThe first women's rights convention was the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], a regional event held on July 19 and 20, 1848, in [[Seneca Falls (hamlet), New York|Seneca Falls]] in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Five women called the convention, four of whom were [[Quaker views on women|Quaker social activists]], including the well-known [[Lucretia Mott]]. The fifth was [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who had discussed the need to organize for women's rights with Mott several years earlier.<ref>McMillen (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TzVRlFXiYswC&pg=PA3 pp. 3, 72, 77, 84]</ref>\nStanton, who came from a family that was deeply involved in politics, became a major force in convincing the women's movement that political pressure was crucial to its goals, and that the right to vote was a key weapon.<ref>Dubois, ed.

When her husband, a well-known social reformer, learned that she intended to introduce this resolution, he refused to attend the convention and accused her of acting in a way that would turn the proceedings into a farce. Lucretia Mott, the main speaker, was also disturbed by the proposal. The resolution was adopted only after [[Frederick Douglass]], an abolitionist leader and a former slave, gave it his strong support.<ref>Wellman (2004), \n[https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&pg=PA193 pp. 193, 195, 203]</ref>\nThe convention's [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which was written primarily by Stanton, expressed an intent to build a women's rights movement, and it included a list of grievances, the first two of which protested the lack of women's suffrage.<ref>McMillen (2008), pp. 88\u201389, 238\u201339</ref> The grievances which were aimed at the United States government \"demanded government reform and changes in male roles and behaviors that promoted inequality for women.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/expref/crusader/seneca.html|title=Seneca Falls Convention - American Memory Timeline- Classroom Presentation|last=|first=|date=|website=Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis convention was followed two weeks later by the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848]], which featured many of the same speakers and likewise voted to support women's suffrage.

The conventions also discussed a variety of other issues, including dress reform and liberalization of divorce laws.</ref>\nAt the first national convention Stone gave a speech that included a call to petition state legislatures for the right of suffrage.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 109\u201310</ref>\n\nReports of this convention reached Britain, prompting [[Harriet Taylor Mill|Harriet Taylor]], soon to be married to philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], to write an essay called \"The Enfranchisement of Women,\" which was published in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''. Heralding the women's movement in the U.S., Taylor's essay helped to initiate a similar movement in Britain. Her essay was reprinted as a women's rights tract in the U.S. and was sold for decades.<ref>McMillen (2008), p. 115</ref><ref>Flexner (1959), p. 76</ref>\n\n[[File:Lucy stone.jpg|thumb|left| Lucy Stone]]\n \n[[Wendell Phillips]], a prominent abolitionist and women's rights advocate, delivered a speech at the second national convention in 1851 called \"Shall Women Have the Right to Vote?\" Describing women's suffrage as the cornerstone of the women's movement, it was later circulated as a women's rights tract.<ref>McMillen (2008), p. 116</ref>\n\nSeveral of the women who played leading roles in the national conventions, especially Stone, Anthony and Stanton, were also leaders in establishing women's suffrage organizations after the Civil War.<ref>The first national convention was organized primarily by Davis. The next several conventions were organized primarily by Stone. After the birth of her daughter in 1857, Stone withdrew from most public activity for several years.  Anthony shared responsibilities for the 1858 and 1859 conventions. Stanton was the primary organizer of the 1860 convention. For details, see Million (2003), pp. 105\u20136, 116, 174, 239, 250\u201352, 260, 263\u201369</ref>\nThey also included the demand for suffrage as part of their activities during the 1850s. In 1852 Stanton advocated women's suffrage in a speech at the New York State Temperance Convention.<ref>McMillen (2008), p. 123</ref>\nIn 1853 Stone became the first woman to appeal for women's suffrage before a body of lawmakers when she addressed the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 136\u201337.</ref>\nIn 1854 Anthony organized a petition campaign in New York State that included the demand for suffrage.  It culminated in a women's rights convention in the state capitol and a speech by Stanton before the state legislature.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 79\u201380</ref>\nIn 1857 Stone refused to pay taxes on the grounds that women were taxed without being able to vote on tax laws.  The [[constable]] sold her household goods at auction until enough money had been raised to pay her tax bill.<ref>Million (2003), p. 245.</ref>\n\nThe women's rights movement was loosely structured during this period, with few state organizations and no national organization other than a coordinating committee that arranged the annual national conventions.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 109, 121</ref>\nMuch of the organizational work for these conventions was performed by Stone, the most visible leader of the movement during this period.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 116, 173\u201374, 264</ref>\nAt the national convention in 1852, a proposal was made to form a national women's rights organization, but the idea was dropped after fears were voiced that such a move would create cumbersome machinery and lead to internal divisions.<ref>McMillen (2008), p. 113</ref>\n\n===Anthony\u2013Stanton collaboration===\n\n[[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] met in 1851 and soon became close friends and co-workers. Their decades-long collaboration was pivotal for the suffrage movement and contributed significantly to the broader struggle for women's rights, which Stanton called \"the greatest revolution the world has ever known or ever will know.\"<ref>Sigerman, Harriet, ''Elizabeth Cady Stanton: The Right Is Ours'', 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rLDKhn38wZYC&pg=PA95 p. 95].

Its drive for [[universal suffrage]], however, was resisted by some abolitionist leaders and their allies in the [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who wanted women to postpone their campaign for suffrage until it had first been achieved for male African Americans. [[Horace Greeley]], a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, \"This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is 'the negro's hour,' and your first duty now is to go through the State and plead his claims.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/270/mode/2up p. 270]. Greeley was referring to the 1867 AERA campaign in New York State for women's suffrage and the removal of discriminatory property requirements for black voters.</ref>\nThey and others, including Lucy Stone, refused to postpone their demands, however, and continued to push for [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn April 1867 Stone and her husband [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] opened the AERA campaign in [[Kansas]] in support of [[referendum|referenda]] in that state that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] both African Americans and women.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/232/mode/2up p. 232]</ref>\n[[Wendell Phillips]], an abolitionist leader who opposed mixing those two causes, surprised and angered AERA workers by blocking the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA105 p. 105]</ref>\nAfter an internal struggle, Kansas Republicans decided to support suffrage for black men only and formed an \"Anti-Female Suffrage Committee\" to oppose the AERA's efforts.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA124 pp. 124, 127]</ref> \nBy the end of summer the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted.\nAnthony and Stanton were harshly criticized by Stone and other AERA members for accepting help during the last days of the campaign from [[George Francis Train]], a wealthy businessman who supported women's rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party, which had won the loyalty of many reform activists,  and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA93 pp. 92\u201394].</ref>\n\nAfter the Kansas campaign, the AERA increasingly divided into two wings, both advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first, if necessary, and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Anthony and Stanton, insisted that women and black men be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a politically independent women's movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists for financial and other resources. \nThe acrimonious annual meeting of the AERA in May 1869 signaled the effective demise of the organization, in the aftermath of which two competing woman suffrage organizations were created.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA80 pp. 80\u201381, 189, 196]. The AERA held no further annual meetings and went out of existence a year later.

In November 1869, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Julia Ward Howe]], [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] and others, many of whom had helped to create the New England Woman Suffrage Association a year earlier, formed the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA).  The hostile rivalry between these two organizations created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades, affecting even professional historians of the women's movement.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA173 pp. 173, 189, 196].</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick Douglass as a younger man.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Douglass]]\n\nThe immediate cause for the split was the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], a [[reconstruction amendments|reconstruction amendment]] that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. Stanton and Anthony opposed its passage unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds.

[[Frederick Douglass]], a strong supporter of women's suffrage, said, \"The race to which I belong have not generally taken the right ground on this question.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=The Anniversaries |newspaper=New York Tribune |date=May 15, 1868}} Quoted in Dudden (2011), p. 149.</ref>\nDouglass, however, strongly supported the amendment, saying it was a matter of life and death for former slaves.  Lucy Stone, who became the AWSA's most prominent leader, supported the amendment but said she believed that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/382/mode/2up pp. 382\u2013384].

Stanton, for example, believed that a long process of education would be needed before what she called the \"lower orders\" of former slaves and immigrant workers would be able to participate meaningfully as voters.<ref name=\"Rakow-48\"/>\nIn an article in ''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'', Stanton wrote, \"American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.\"<ref>Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \"The Sixteenth Amendment,\" ''The Revolution'', April 29, 1869, p. 266.

Soon hundreds of women tried to vote in dozens of localities.\nIn some cases, actions like these preceded the New Departure strategy: in 1868 in Vineland, New Jersey, a center for radical [[spiritualism|spiritualists]], nearly 200 women placed their ballots into a separate box and attempted to have them counted, but without success.

Although she had little previous connection to the women's movement, she presented a modified version of the New Departure strategy. Instead of asking the courts to declare that women had the right to vote, she asked Congress itself to declare that the Constitution implicitly enfranchised women. The committee rejected her suggestion.<ref>DuBois (1998), pp. 100, 122</ref>\nThe NWSA at first reacted enthusiastically to Woodhull's sudden appearance on the scene.  Stanton in particular welcomed Woodhull's proposal to assemble a broad-based reform party that would support women's suffrage.  Anthony opposed that idea, wanting the NWSA to remain politically independent.  The NWSA soon had reason to regret its association with Woodhull. In 1872 she published details of a purported adulterous affair between Rev. [[Henry Ward Beecher]], president of the AWSA, and Elizabeth Tilton, wife of a leading NWSA member.<ref>DuBois, ed.

Originally envisioned as a modest publication that would be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years. Susan B. Anthony had been collecting material, such as newspaper articles and reports, during her time as a women's rights activist. Due to the amount of work required from the project, Susan B. Anthony would take their belonging, and materials related to their research to Stanton's household in 1876. Reviewing their past efforts was a strenuous activity for Anthony, as each letter or article gave her less hope that they'll be able to complete this retelling of history.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harper |first1=Ida Husted |title=The Life and Work of Susan B.

Lucy Stone is known to have little interest in Anthony and Stanton's book because she believed that history should be refrained from being recorded by the parties involved. Stone was concerned about the possible bias thoughts that could be included in the book, and only gave limited information about\u00a0 Stone's party (AWSA).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stanton |first1=Elizabeth Cady |title=The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press. {{ISBN|0-87049-836-3}}</ref> Work at the state level, however, also had its frustrations. Between 1870 and 1910, the suffrage movement conducted 480 campaigns in 33 states just to have the issue of women's suffrage brought before the voters, and those campaigns resulted in only 17 instances of the issue actually being placed on the ballot.<ref>Flexner (1959), p. 213</ref> These efforts led to women's suffrage in two states, Colorado and Idaho.\n\n[[Alice Stone Blackwell]], daughter of AWSA leaders Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell, was a major influence in bringing the rival suffrage leaders together, proposing a joint meeting in 1887 to discuss a merger. Anthony and Stone favored the idea, but opposition from several NWSA veterans delayed the move. In 1890 the two organizations merged as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).<ref>Dubois, ed. (1992) pp. 178\u201380</ref> Stanton was president of the new organization, and Stone was chair of its executive committee, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice, becoming president herself in 1892 when Stanton retired.<ref>McMillen (2008), pp. 228, 231</ref>\n\n===National American Woman Suffrage Association===\n\nAlthough Anthony was the leading force in the newly merged organization, it did not always follow her lead.  In 1893 the NAWSA voted over Anthony's objection to alternate the site of its annual conventions between Washington and various other parts of the country.  Anthony's pre-merger NWSA had always held its conventions in Washington to help maintain focus on a national suffrage amendment.  Arguing against this decision, she said she feared, accurately as it turned out, that the NAWSA would engage in suffrage work at the state level at the expense of national work.<ref>Flexner (1959), pp. 212\u201313</ref>\n\nStanton, elderly but still very much a radical, did not fit comfortably into the new organization, which was becoming more conservative. In 1895 she published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', a controversial best-seller that attacked the use of the [[Bible]] to relegate women to an inferior status. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with the book despite Anthony's objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful. Stanton afterwards grew increasingly alienated from the suffrage movement.<ref>Dubois, ed.

Catt began revitalizing the organization, establishing a plan of work with clear goals for every state every year. Anthony was impressed and arranged for Catt to succeed her when she retired from the presidency of the NAWSA in 1900. In her new post Catt continued her effort to transform the unwieldy organization into one that would be better prepared to lead a major suffrage campaign.<ref>Scott and Scott (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA24 pp. 24\u201325]</ref>\n\nCatt noted the rapidly growing  [[woman's club|women's club]] movement, which was taking up some of the slack left by the decline of the temperance movement.  Local women's clubs at first were mostly reading groups focused on literature, but they increasingly evolved into civic improvement organizations of middle-class women meeting in each other's homes weekly. Their national organization was the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC), founded in 1890. The clubs avoided controversial issues that would divide the membership, especially religion and prohibition.  In the South and East, suffrage was also highly divisive, while there was little resistance to it among clubwomen in the West.  In the Midwest, clubwomen had first avoided the suffrage issue out of caution, but after 1900 increasingly came to support it.<ref>Stephen M. Buechler, ''The Transformation of the Woman Suffrage Movement: The Case of Illinois, 1850-1920'' (1986) pp 154-57</ref> Catt implemented what was known as the \"society plan,\" a successful effort to recruit wealthy members of the women's club movement whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement.<ref>Graham (1996), pp. 36\u201337</ref>   By 1914 women's suffrage was endorsed by the national General Federation of Women's Clubs.<ref>Dubois, ed.

Shaw was an energetic worker and a talented orator but not an effective administrator. Between 1910 and 1916 the NAWSA's national board experienced a constant turmoil that endangered the existence of the organization.<ref>Scott and Scott (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA31 pp. 25, 31]</ref>\n\nAlthough its membership and finances were at all-time highs, the NAWSA decided to replace Shaw by bringing Catt back once again as president in 1915. Authorized by the NAWSA to name her own executive board, which previously had been elected by the organization's annual convention, Catt quickly converted the loosely structured organization into one that was highly centralized.<ref>Graham (1996), pp. 81, 86</ref>\n\n===''MacKenzie v.

Society women in particular had personal access to powerful politicians, and were reluctant to surrender that advantage.

Its credo, as set down by its president [[Josephine Jewell Dodge]], was:\n\n<blockquote>We believe in every possible advancement to women.  We believe that this advancement should be along those legitimate lines of work and endeavor for which she is best fitted and for which she has now unlimited opportunities.  We believe this advancement will be better achieved through strictly non-partisan effort and without the limitations of the ballot.

They were very similar to the suffragists themselves, but used a counter-crusading style warning of the evils that suffrage would bring to women. They rejected leadership by men and stressed the importance of independent women in philanthropy and social betterment.  NYSAOWS was narrowly defeated in New York in 1916 and the state voted to give women the vote. The organization moved to Washington to oppose the federal constitutional amendment for suffrage, becoming the \"National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage\" (NAOWS), where it was taken over by men, and assumed a much harsher rhetorical tone, especially in attacking \"red radicalism\".

Green, ''Southern Strategies: Southern Women and the Woman Suffrage Question'' (1997) p 52</ref>\n\n[[Henry Browne Blackwell]], an officer of the AWSA before the merger and a prominent figure in the movement afterwards, urged the suffrage movement to follow a strategy of convincing southern political leaders that they could ensure [[white supremacy]] in their region without violating the Fifteenth Amendment by enfranchising educated women, who would predominantly be white. Shortly after Blackwell presented his proposal to the [[Mississippi]] delegation to the U.S. Congress, his plan was given serious consideration by the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1890, whose main purpose was to find legal ways of further curtailing the political power of African Americans.  Although the convention adopted other measures instead, the fact that Blackwell's ideas were taken seriously drew the interest of many suffragists.<ref>Wheeler (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA113 pp. 113\u201314]</ref>\n\nBlackwell's ally in this effort was [[Laura Clay]], who convinced the NAWSA to launch a state-by-state campaign in the South based on Blackwell's strategy.  Clay was one of several southern NAWSA members who opposed the idea of a national women's suffrage amendment on the grounds that it would impinge on [[states' rights]].  (A generation later Clay campaigned against the pending national amendment during the final battle for its ratification.) Amid predictions by some proponents of this strategy that the South would lead the way in the enfranchisement of women, suffrage organizations were established throughout the region.  Anthony, Catt and Blackwell campaigned for suffrage in the South in 1895, with the latter two calling for suffrage only for educated women.  With Anthony's reluctant cooperation, the NAWSA maneuvered to accommodate the politics of white supremacy in that region.  Anthony asked her old friend Frederick Douglass, a former slave, not to attend the NAWSA convention in Atlanta in 1895, the first to be held in a southern city.  Black NAWSA members were excluded from 1903 convention in the southern city of New Orleans, which marked the peak of this strategy's influence.<ref>Wheeler (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA114 pp.114\u201318, 177]</ref>\n\nThe leaders of the Southern movement were privileged upper-class belles with a strong position in high society and in church affairs. They tried to use their upscale connections to convince powerful men that suffrage was a good idea to purify society. They also argued that giving white women the vote would more than counterbalance giving the vote to the smaller number of black women.<ref>Evelyn A. Kirkley, \"'This Work is God's Cause': Religion in the Southern Woman Suffrage Movement, 1880\u20131920.\" ''Church history'' (1990) 59#4 pp: 507-522 esp p 508</ref>  No southern state enfranchised women as a result of this strategy, however, and most southern suffrage societies that were established during this period lapsed into inactivity.  The NAWSA leadership afterwards said it would not adopt policies that \"advocated the exclusion of any race or class from the right of suffrage.\"<ref>Wheeler (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA120 pp.121, 120]</ref> Nonetheless NAWSA reflected its white membership's viewpoint by minimizing the role of black suffragists.

Paul had been jailed there and had endured [[force-feeding|forced feedings]] after going on a hunger strike. In January 1913 she arrived in Washington as chair of the Congressional Committee of the NAWSA, charged with reviving the drive for a constitutional amendment that would enfranchise women. She and her coworker [[Lucy Burns]] organized a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s inauguration as president. Opponents of the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order.

In November 1935, the court ruled that the Danish Colonial Law was unconstitutional as it conflicted with the 19th Amendment{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=53}} and that it had not been the intent to limit the franchise to men. To test the law, Williams attempted to register to vote and encouraged other teachers to do so, but their applications were refused. Williams, Eulalie Stevens and Anna M. Vessup, all literate, property owners, petitioned the court to open elections to qualified women.{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1987|pp=59-60}} Judge [[Albert L\u00e9vitt]] ruled in favor of the women on 27 December, which led to mobilization to register to vote in [[Saint Croix]] and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]].{{sfn|Terborg-Penn|1998|p=53}}\n\n====Changes in the voting population====\nAlthough restricting access to the polls because of sex was made unconstitutional in 1920, women did not turn out to the polls in the same numbers as men until 1980. A term commonly used that represents the push for equal representation in government is known as Mirror Representation. The amount of representation of sex in government should match the portion of that specific sex in the population. From 1980 until the present, women have voted in elections in at least the same percentage as have men, and often more. This difference in voting turnout and preferences between men and women is known as the [[voting gender gap]]. The voting gender gap has impacted political elections and, consequently, the way candidates campaign for office.\n\n====Changes in representation and government programs====\nAfter women gained the right to vote, the presence of women in Congress gradually increased since 1920, with an especially steady increase from 1981.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Today, women increasingly pursue politics as a career.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} At the state and national level, women have brought attention to gender-sensitive topics, gender equality, and children's rights. Women's participation rate is higher at local levels of government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} \n\nIn 1972, [[Shirley Chisholm]] became the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.\n\nIn 1984, [[Geraldine Ferraro]] became the first woman vice presidential candidate to be nominated by a major party.\n\nIn 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] became the first female presidential candidate to be nominated by a major party.\n\nIn 2019, 25 out of 100 senators were women, and 102 out of 435 representatives were women.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers |title=Current Numbers |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> This resembles the global average; around the world, in 2018, just under a quarter of national-level parliament representatives were women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm|title=Women in National Parliaments|website=ipu.org|publisher=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]}}</ref> \u00a0\n\n====Notable legislation====\nImmediately following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, many legislators feared a powerful women's bloc would emerge as a result of female enfranchisement. The [[Sheppard\u2013Towner Act|Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921]], which expanded maternity care during the 1920s, was one of the first laws passed appealing to the female vote.<ref>Lynn Dumenil, ''The Modern Temper: American Culture and Society in the 1920s'', Hill and Wang, (1995)</ref>\n\n====Socio-economic effects====\nA paper by [[John Lott]] and Lawrence W. Kenny, published by the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', found that women generally voted along more [[liberalism|liberal]] political philosophies than men.  The paper concluded that women's voting appeared to be more risk-averse than men and favored candidates or policies that supported [[Redistribution of income and wealth|wealth transfer]], [[social insurance]], [[progressive taxation]], and larger government.<ref>[[John Lott|Lott, John]] and Lawrence W.

The club started the season with [[John Sillett]] in charge, three years after he and [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] had managed the club to victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]]. Sillett left the club in November after a run of poor results, and was replaced by [[Terry Butcher]] who arrived as a player-manager from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nCoventry's league form in the season was a contrast between a solid home record and poor away form, as they recorded only one win away from [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]]. In the FA Cup they suffered a defeat to Southampton in the fourth round, but the highlight of the season was their run in [[1991 League Cup|the League Cup]]. They beat holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 5\u20134 in the fourth round, before losing to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-final.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1990\u201391 season was [[Coventry City]]'s 24th consecutive campaign in the [[Football League First Division]], following their promotion from the Second Division in 1967.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} The club had achieved its first major trophy a few seasons earlier, with victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]] Final under the joint management of [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] and [[John Sillett]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/coventry-city-1987-fa-cup-11336205 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Coventry City's 1987 FA Cup final victory over Tottenham Hotspur 32 years on |author=Andy Turner |date=16 May 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> and Sillett remained manager at the beginning of 1990\u201391. Their league form in the seasons following the cup win was solid with tenth, seventh,{{sfn|Brassington|1989|p=125}} and twelfth place finishes,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} although the 1989\u201390 season finished disappointingly as they won just won of their final nine games.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}} They failed to defend the FA Cup in 1987\u201388, exiting in the fourth round,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=108}} and they suffered one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history in 1989\u201390, as they [[Sutton United 2\u20131 Coventry City (1989)|lost 2\u20131]] to non-league [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] in the third round.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/03/vault-sutton-united-coventry-city-fa-cup-1989-giantkilling |work=The Guardian |date=3 January 2014 |author=Paul Campbell |title=From the Vault: Sutton United knock Coventry City out of the FA Cup in 1989}}</ref> They suffered another embarrassing FA Cup defeat the following season, this time to Third Division [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]], but fared better in [[1989\u201390 Football League Cup|the League Cup]], reaching the semi-final with a 5\u20130 win over Sunderland before losing to eventual winners [[Nottingham Forest]] in the semi-final.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nSillett did not buy or sell very heavily in the summer of 1990, before the start of the season. Supporters were calling for a strong midfield player to be bought to bolster the team, but defender [[Andy Pearce]] was the only major signing, bought from [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] for \u00a315,000. [[Greg Downs]], who had been part of the Cup winning squad, moved to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer. Despite this lack of transfer activity and the poor finish to the previous season, Sillett was optimistic that the club could challenge for a top six finish or even the league title.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}}\n\n==Season summary==\n===Football League First Division===\nThe season started poorly, with a win against a struggling [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] side the only highlight of the opening games. Under pressure to change something, and with regulars [[Dean Emerson]] and [[Lloyd McGrath]] injured, Sillett signed players from Europe to add depth to the team. Winger [[Zolt\u00e1n Csucs\u00e1nszky]] came from Hungary for a trial, but sustained an injury in his first game, a friendly.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}} Uruguayan [[Jos\u00e9 Perdomo]] had more success, arriving on loan from [[Genoa F.C.|Genoa]] and impressing Sillett in six games for Coventry. The club were unable to sign him permanently, however.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}}\n\nResults did not improve significantly as the autumn progressed, and morale was poor. Star striker [[David Speedie]] was dropped from the team after a run of poor performances, and by November the club were in sixteenth position.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> In November, the club announced that Sillett was leaving his post as manager. Historians do not know if he resigned or was sacked, although he was not working due to sickness at the time and had been planning to leave at the end of the season anyway. The club appointed [[Terry Butcher]] as Sillett's replacement.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Butcher was still an active player for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the time, and had been captain of the [[England national football team|England team]] during their World Cup semi-final against West Germany in the summer, so he arrived as [[player\u2013manager]] and the club had to pay a transfer fee of up to \u00a3450,000 for him. His first game, at home to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], ended in a defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/2019/november/supremos-a-look-at-the-career-of-terry-butcher/ |work=Coventry City F.C. |title=SUPREMOS: A look at the career of Terry Butcher |date=20 November 2019 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDespite success in the League Cup, Butcher had to wait more than a month before the club won a league game under his management and supporters feared that the club would be dragged into a relegation battle. Butcher bought [[Ray Woods (footballer)|Ray Woods]] from Wigan Athletic, but was forced to sell the promising young players [[Steve Livingstone]] and [[Tony Dobson]], who both left for Blackburn Rovers. Speedie was also sold, moving to Liverpool for \u00a3675,000, following a series of sub-par performances and a poor relationship with Butcher. Butcher then signed [[Kenny Sansom]] and [[Stewart Robson]], and the club began to record some better results,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} recording home wins against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea, amongst others. By mid-April, with three games remaining, Coventry had moved up to ninth place in the table, but two defeats from their last three games saw them finish in sixteenth.<ref name=\"Statto\"/>\n\nThe league season had been a contrast between excellent form at [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]], where the side won ten of nineteen games and were unbeaten after the November defeat to Liverpool, and a poor away record with just one win,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} at Sheffield United early in the season.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> The player of the year was [[Kevin Gallacher]], who scored eleven league goals.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=307}} As a player, Terry Butcher had only started seven games, six in the league, as a result of injury. [[Cyrille Regis]] played well throughout the season, but did not score heavily and was released by Coventry at the end of the season, moving to rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.]]{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}}\n\n===FA Cup===\nFollowing defeats to lower-division and non-league opposition in the previous two seasons, Coventry faced the possibility of another upset in the third round against [[Wigan Athletic]].{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Wigan had some future top-flight players in their team including [[Peter Atherton]], who later signed for Coventry, but were having a poor season, being in seventeenth place in [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]]. The first match, played at Highfield Road on 5 January 1991, ended in a 1\u20131 draw as [[Micky Gynn]]'s opener in the 66th minute was cancelled out by a last minute equaliser by Wigan's [[Darren Patterson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockneylatic.co.uk/match-reports/1990-1991/943-coventry-city-1-wigan-athletic-1 |title=1990-1991 - Coventry City 1 Wigan Athletic 1 |author=John Patrick Heeley |work=Cockney Latic |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> The replay at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]] was four days later and was won 1\u20130 by Coventry courtesy of another Gynn goal.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=11v11 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/wigan-athletic-v-coventry-city-09-january-1991-216384/ |title=Wigan Athletic v Coventry City, 09 January 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth round in late January, a few days after their defeat in the League Cup quarter final, City again drew 1\u20131 at home against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] with [[Alan Shearer]] equalising after Brian Kilcline's opener.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} In the replay at [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]] City had eight players out through injury,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} and lost [[Steve Ogrizovic]] after 24 minutes. Southampton went on to win 2\u20130.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}}\n\n===Football League Cup===\nAfter reaching the semi-final in the 1989\u201390 season,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=300}} Coventry again performed well in the [[1990\u201391 Football League Cup]], also known as the Rumbelow's Cup. The campaign began in September with a two-legged second-round tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], in which City won both their home and away games by scores of 4\u20132 and 3\u20132 respectively. In the third round, on 31 October, they played at home to [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]]. The visitors dominated the first half but were unable to score, and then suffered the set-back of losing former Coventry player [[Dave Bamber]]. Coventry improved after half-time, and won the game 3\u20130 with goals from Speedie, Livingstone and Regis.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}}\n\nIn the fourth round on 28 November,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} Coventry faced [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in Butcher's third match as manager. Forest had won the tournament in both of the previous two seasons, beating City on each occasion, and started the match as favourites. After 35 minutes, Coventry had moved into a 4\u20130 lead with Gallacher claiming a [[hat-trick]] and [[Steve Livingstone]] also scoring. Forest responded, however, and [[Nigel Clough]], son of manager [[Brian Clough]], stunned Highfield Road with a hat-trick of his own, scored in just seven minutes and leaving the score 4\u20133 at half time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/flashback-coventry-citys-famous-5-4-8194722 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Flashback: Coventry City's famous 5-4 League Cup victory over Nottingham Forest on this day in 1990 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=28 November 2014 |author=Aidan McCartney}}</ref> Forest levelled the match through a [[Garry Parker]] goal after half-time, but Livingstone's goal with half an hour remaining won the game for Coventry by a 5\u20134 scoreline.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=124}}\n\nCity had to wait almost two months for their next match in the competition, the quarter-final tie at home to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] of the Second Division. Coventry created few chances in the game, with player-manager Terry Butcher sustaining an injury as well, and [[Nigel Pearson]]'s 9th minute goal was enough to win the

The club started the season with [[John Sillett]] in charge, three years after he and [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] had managed the club to victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]]. Sillett left the club in November after a run of poor results, and was replaced by [[Terry Butcher]] who arrived as a player-manager from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nCoventry's league form in the season was a contrast between a solid home record and poor away form, as they recorded only one win away from [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]]. In the FA Cup they suffered a defeat to Southampton in the fourth round, but the highlight of the season was their run in [[1991 League Cup|the League Cup]]. They beat holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 5\u20134 in the fourth round, before losing to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-final.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1990\u201391 season was [[Coventry City]]'s 24th consecutive campaign in the [[Football League First Division]], following their promotion from the Second Division in 1967.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} The club had achieved its first major trophy a few seasons earlier, with victory in the [1986\u201387 FA Cup]] Final under the joint management of [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] and [[John Sillett]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/coventry-city-1987-fa-cup-11336205 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Coventry City's 1987 FA Cup final victory over Tottenham Hotspur 32 years on |author=Andy Turner |date=16 May 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> and Sillett remained manager at the beginning of 1990\u201391. Their league form in the seasons following the cup win was solid with tenth, seventh,{{sfn|Brassington|1989|p=125}} and twelfth place finishes,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} although the 1989\u201390 season finished disappointingly as they won just won of their final nine games.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}} They failed to defend the FA Cup in 1987\u201388, exiting in the fourth round,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=108}} and they suffered one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history in 1989\u201390, as they [[Sutton United 2\u20131 Coventry City (1989)|lost 2\u20131]] to non-league [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] in the third round.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/03/vault-sutton-united-coventry-city-fa-cup-1989-giantkilling |work=The Guardian |date=3 January 2014 |author=Paul Campbell |title=From the Vault: Sutton United knock Coventry City out of the FA Cup in 1989}}</ref> They suffered another embarrassing FA Cup defeat the following season, this time to Third Division [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]], but fared better in [[1989\u201390 Football League Cup|the League Cup]], reaching the semi-final with a 5\u20130 win over Sunderland before losing to eventual winners [[Nottingham Forest]] in the semi-final.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nSillett did not buy or sell very heavily in the summer of 1990, before the start of the season. Supporters were calling for a strong midfield player to be bought to bolster the team, but defender [[Andy Pearce]] was the only major signing, bought from [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] for \u00a315,000. [[Greg Downs]], who had been part of the Cup winning squad, moved to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer. Despite this lack of transfer activity and the poor finish to the previous season, Sillett was optimistic that the club could challenge for a top six finish or even the league title.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}}\n\n==Season summary==\n===Football League First Division===\nThe season started poorly, with a win against a struggling [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] side the only highlight of the opening games. Under pressure to change something, and with regulars [[Dean Emerson]] and [[Lloyd McGrath]] injured, Sillett signed players from Europe to add depth to the team. Winger [[Zolt\u00e1n Csucs\u00e1nszky]] came from Hungary for a trial, but sustained an injury in his first game, a friendly.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}} Uruguayan [[Jos\u00e9 Perdomo]] had more success, arriving on loan from [[Genoa F.C.|Genoa]] and impressing Sillett in six games for Coventry. The club were unable to sign him permanently, however.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}}\n\nResults did not improve significantly as the autumn progressed, and morale was poor. Star striker [[David Speedie]] was dropped from the team after a run of poor performances, and by November the club were in sixteenth position.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> In November, the club announced that Sillett was leaving his post as manager. Historians do not know if he resigned or was sacked, although he was not working due to sickness at the time and had been planning to leave at the end of the season anyway. The club appointed [[Terry Butcher]] as Sillett's replacement.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Butcher was still an active player for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the time, and had been captain of the [[England national football team|England team]] during their World Cup semi-final against West Germany in the summer, so he arrived as [[player\u2013manager]] and the club had to pay a transfer fee of up to \u00a3450,000 for him. His first game, at home to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], ended in a defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/2019/november/supremos-a-look-at-the-career-of-terry-butcher/ |work=Coventry City F.C. |title=SUPREMOS: A look at the career of Terry Butcher |date=20 November 2019 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDespite success in the League Cup, Butcher had to wait more than a month before the club won a league game under his management and supporters feared that the club would be dragged into a relegation battle. Butcher bought [[Ray Woods (footballer)|Ray Woods]] from Wigan Athletic, but was forced to sell the promising young players [[Steve Livingstone]] and [[Tony Dobson]], who both left for Blackburn Rovers. Speedie was also sold, moving to Liverpool for \u00a3675,000, following a series of sub-par performances and a poor relationship with Butcher. Butcher then signed [[Kenny Sansom]] and [[Stewart Robson]], and the club began to record some better results,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} recording home wins against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea, amongst others. By mid-April, with three games remaining, Coventry had moved up to ninth place in the table, but two defeats from their last three games saw them finish in sixteenth.<ref name=\"Statto\"/>\n\nThe league season had been a contrast between excellent form at [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]], where the side won ten of nineteen games and were unbeaten after the November defeat to Liverpool, and a poor away record with just one win,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} at Sheffield United early in the season.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> The player of the year was [[Kevin Gallacher]], who scored eleven league goals.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=307}} As a player, Terry Butcher had only started seven games, six in the league, as a result of injury. [[Cyrille Regis]] played well throughout the season, but did not score heavily and was released by Coventry at the end of the season, moving to rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.]]{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}}\n\n===FA Cup===\nFollowing defeats to lower-division and non-league opposition in the previous two seasons, Coventry faced the possibility of another upset in the third round against [[Wigan Athletic]].{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Wigan had some future top-flight players in their team including [[Peter Atherton]], who later signed for Coventry, but were having a poor season, being in seventeenth place in [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]]. The first match, played at Highfield Road on 5 January 1991, ended in a 1\u20131 draw as [[Micky Gynn]]'s opener in the 66th minute was cancelled out by a last minute equaliser by Wigan's [[Darren Patterson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockneylatic.co.uk/match-reports/1990-1991/943-coventry-city-1-wigan-athletic-1 |title=1990-1991 - Coventry City 1 Wigan Athletic 1 |author=John Patrick Heeley |work=Cockney Latic |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> The replay at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]] was four days later and was won 1\u20130 by Coventry courtesy of another Gynn goal.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=11v11 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/wigan-athletic-v-coventry-city-09-january-1991-216384/ |title=Wigan Athletic v Coventry City, 09 January 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth round in late January, a few days after their defeat in the League Cup quarter final, City again drew 1\u20131 at home against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] with [[Alan Shearer]] equalising after Brian Kilcline's opener.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} In the replay at [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]] City had eight players out through injury,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} and lost [[Steve Ogrizovic]] after 24 minutes.

The campaign began in September with a two-legged second-round tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], in which City won both their home and away games by scores of 4\u20132 and 3\u20132 respectively. In the third round, on 31 October, they played at home to [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]]. The visitors dominated the first half but were unable to score, and then suffered the set-back of losing former Coventry player [[Dave Bamber]]. Coventry improved after half-time, and won the game 3\u20130 with goals from Speedie, Livingstone and Regis.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}}\n\nIn the fourth round on 28 November,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} Coventry faced [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in Butcher's third match as manager. Forest had won the tournament in both of the previous two seasons, beating City on each occasion, and started the match as favourites. After 35 minutes, Coventry had moved into a 4\u20130 lead with Gallacher claiming a [[hat-trick]] and [[Steve Livingstone]] also scoring. Forest responded, however, and [[Nigel Clough]], son of manager [[Brian Clough]], stunned Highfield Road with a hat-trick of his own, scored in just seven minutes and leaving the score 4\u20133 at half time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/flashback-coventry-citys-famous-5-4-8194722 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Flashback: Coventry City's famous 5-4 League Cup victory over Nottingham Forest on this day in 1990 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=28 November 2014 |author=Aidan McCartney}}</ref> Forest levelled the match through a [[Garry Parker]] goal after half-time, but Livingstone's goal with half an hour remaining won the game for Coventry by a 5\u20134 scoreline.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=124}}\n\nCity had to wait almost two months for their next match in the competition, the quarter-final tie at home to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] of the Second Division. Coventry created few chances in the game, with player-manager Terry Butcher sustaining an injury as well, and [[Nigel Pearson]]'s 9th minute goal was enough to win the
