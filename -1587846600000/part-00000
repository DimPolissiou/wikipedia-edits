It entered service in 1997 as the second aircraft designed to have advanced stealth technology after the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] attack aircraft. Though designed originally as primarily a nuclear bomber, the B-2 was first used in combat dropping conventional, non-nuclear [[aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] in the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. It later served in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], and [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libya]].<ref name = B-2_AF_fact_sheet/>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nBy the mid-1970s, military aircraft designers had learned of a new method to avoid missiles and interceptors, known today as \"[[Stealth aircraft|stealth]]\". The concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed [[radar]] signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having radar stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although other detection measures existed, such as human observation, [[Infrared search and track|infrared scanners]], [[Acoustic location|acoustic locators]], their relatively short detection range or poorly-developed technology allowed most aircraft to fly undetected, or at least untracked, especially at night.<ref>Rao, G.A. and S.P. Mahulikar. \"Integrated review of stealth technology and its role in airpower\". ''Aeronautical Journal'', v. 106 (1066), 2002, pp. 629\u2013641.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[DARPA]] requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest [[radar cross-section]] of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars.<ref>Crickmore and Crickmore 2003, p. 9.</ref> Initially, [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] were selected for further development. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] had experience in this field due to developing the [[Lockheed A-12]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]], which included a number of stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in [[Radar-absorbent material|radar-absorbing paint]]. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a \"faceted\" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with \"the [[Lockheed Have Blue|Hopeless Diamond]]\", a model Lockheed built to test the concept.<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm \"Stealth Aircraft.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035221/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm |date=21 July 2011}} ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'', 2003. Retrieved: 5 November 2012.</ref>\n\nPlans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed (XST) project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing. Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the [[Have Blue]] program and eventually the [[F-117]] stealth attack aircraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffin|Kinnu|2007|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Northrop also had a classified technology demonstration aircraft, the [[Tacit Blue]] in development in 1979 at [[Area 51]]. It developed stealth technology, LO (low observables), [[fly-by-wire]], curved surfaces, composite materials, electronic intelligence (ELINT), and Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental (BSAX). \"The stealth technology developed from the program was later incorporated into other operational aircraft designs, including the B-2 stealth bomber\".<ref>[the integrator, Northrop Grumman (newspaper), Volume 8, No. 12, 30 June 2006, page 8 article author: Carol Ilten].</ref>\n\n===ATB program===\nBy 1976, these programs had progressed to a position in which a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter became aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled.<ref>{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=7}}</ref> Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] campaign in 1979, [[Ronald Reagan]] repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In response, on 22 August 1980 the [[Carter administration]] publicly disclosed that the [[United States Department of Defense]] was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.<ref name=goodall>Goodall 1992, {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B2 bomber initial rollout ceremony 1988.jpg|thumb|left|The B-2's first public display in 1988 at Palmdale, California: In front of the B-2 is a star shape formed with five B-2 silhouettes. |alt=Front view of tailless aircraft parked in front of building.

The ATB project continued during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program.

It entered service in 1997 as the second aircraft designed to have advanced stealth technology after the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] attack aircraft. Though designed originally as primarily a nuclear bomber, the B-2 was first used in combat dropping conventional, non-nuclear [[aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] in the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. It later served in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], and [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libya]].<ref name = B-2_AF_fact_sheet/>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nBy the mid-1970s, military aircraft designers had learned of a new method to avoid missiles and interceptors, known today as \"[[Stealth aircraft|stealth]]\". The concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed [[radar]] signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having radar stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although other detection measures existed, such as human observation, [[Infrared search and track|infrared scanners]], [[Acoustic location|acoustic locators]], their relatively short detection range or poorly-developed technology allowed most aircraft to fly undetected, or at least untracked, especially at night.<ref>Rao, G.A. and S.P. Mahulikar. \"Integrated review of stealth technology and its role in airpower\". ''Aeronautical Journal'', v. 106 (1066), 2002, pp. 629\u2013641.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[DARPA]] requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest [[radar cross-section]] of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars.<ref>Crickmore and Crickmore 2003, p. 9.</ref> Initially, [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] were selected for further development. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] had experience in this field due to developing the [[Lockheed A-12]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]], which included a number of stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in [[Radar-absorbent material|radar-absorbing paint]]. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a \"faceted\" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with \"the [[Lockheed Have Blue|Hopeless Diamond]]\", a model Lockheed built to test the concept.<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm \"Stealth Aircraft.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035221/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm |date=21 July 2011}} ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'', 2003. Retrieved: 5 November 2012.</ref>\n\nPlans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed (XST) project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing. Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the [[Have Blue]] program and eventually the [[F-117]] stealth attack aircraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffin|Kinnu|2007|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Northrop also had a classified technology demonstration aircraft, the [[Tacit Blue]] in development in 1979 at [[Area 51]]. It developed stealth technology, LO (low observables), [[fly-by-wire]], curved surfaces, composite materials, electronic intelligence (ELINT), and Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental (BSAX). \"The stealth technology developed from the program was later incorporated into other operational aircraft designs, including the B-2 stealth bomber\".<ref>[the integrator, Northrop Grumman (newspaper), Volume 8, No. 12, 30 June 2006, page 8 article author: Carol Ilten].</ref>\n\n===ATB program===\nBy 1976, these programs had progressed to a position in which a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter became aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled.<ref>{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=7}}</ref> Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] campaign in 1979, [[Ronald Reagan]] repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In response, on 22 August 1980 the [[Carter administration]] publicly disclosed that the [[United States Department of Defense]] was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.<ref name=goodall>Goodall 1992, {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B2 bomber initial rollout ceremony 1988.jpg|thumb|left|The B-2's first public display in 1988 at Palmdale, California: In front of the B-2 is a star shape formed with five B-2 silhouettes. |alt=Front view of tailless aircraft parked in front of building.

In 1996, the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] (GAO) disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers \"will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis\", costing over three times as much as the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] (US$9.6&nbsp;million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8&nbsp;million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's {{convert|172|ft|m|abbr=on}} wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, particularly its \"low-observable\" stealthy skins.<ref>Capaccio, Tony. \"The B-2's Stealthy Skins Need Tender, Lengthy Care.\" ''Defense Week'', 27 May 1997, p. 1.</ref><ref>''US General Accounting Office'' September 1996, pp. 53, 56.</ref> Maintenance costs are about $3.4&nbsp;million a month for each aircraft.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20100614.aspx \"The Gold Plated Hangar Queen Survives.\"] ''Strategyworld.com'', 14 June 2010.
