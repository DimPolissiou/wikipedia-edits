In the 1960's, Zeoli was an early organizer of what would become Baseball Chapel, a Christian organization that provides professional Baseball players, and other athletes, Sunday church services in their locker rooms before sporting events. Zeoli was perhaps most remembered as the long-standing president of Gospel Films Inc, later becoming Gospel Communications Inc, a leading Christian media company that distributed media and promoted ministry outreach around the world. Zeoli held the position from 1962 until he retired from the organization in 2006. \n\n=== White House Chaplain ===\nGerald Ford was elected the Congressional representative of the 5th District of Michigan from 1949 to the time of his Presidency.  Zeoli lived in Grand Rapids, MI and was introduced to Ford by a friend. The two men became friends and Zeoli started sending Ford a devotional once every month in the early 1970's (these devotionals would later become a book called \"God's Got a Better Idea\", a twist on the Ford political slogan, \"Ford has a better idea\"). Ford and Zeoli would meet in Washington and frequent events such as the Presidential Prayer Breakfast, and at sporting events where Zeoli was preaching. It was in Washington D.C. at a pre-game chapel service for the Washington Redskins football team that Zeoli convinced then representative Gerald R. Ford to become a Christian.<ref>http://geraldrfordfoundation.org/centennial/oralhistory/richard-devos/ \"Richard Devos\". The Gerald R. Ford Foundation.</ref>  Ford would later become Vice-President of the United States when Spiro Agnew resigned on October 10, 1973.  While Zeoli was vacationing in Oberammergau, Germany, Ford called Zeoli and informed him that Richard Nixon had resigned and that Ford was now the 38th President of the United States. For the remainder of Ford's Presidency, Zeoli would visit the White House and counsel on spiritual matters with the President. Zeoli's book \"God's Got a Better Idea\" described the many issues that the two discussed including; clemency for draft evaders, the U. S. withdrawal from Vietnam, the Mayaguez incident, and the difficult question of issuing a [[pardon]] to former [[Richard M. Nixon|U.S. President Richard Nixon]], who had resigned following the [[Watergate scandal]] and the administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Billy-Zeoli/e/B001KHF912 ''Billy Zeoli''. Amazon.com</ref>\n\n=== Sports Ministry and Media ===\nZeoli was well-known as a preacher to professional sports teams and celebrities. He was one of the early advocates of the practice of preaching to professional athletes that were working on Sunday. The subject was controversial at the time in Zeoli's community of West Michigan, where he took criticism from many in the Christian Reformed church community. Working with Baseball Chapel founder Watson Spoelstra, and New York Yankee great Bobby Richardson, Zeoli helped to increase the frequency of these services in baseball, football and other sports. Zeoli was the minister for several Super Bowls, World Series, and All-Star Games services and received recognition as a minister for several American major league professional sport teams and athletes.\n\n=== Gospel Films and Gospel Communications ===\nZeoli was working as the director for Indianapolis Youth For Christ when he was hired to lead a fledgling Christian film company in Muskegon, MI called Gospel Films. Under his 44-year tenure, Zeoli would come to be known as an innovator in para-church ministry. He appealed to the youth movement and was a devote of McLuhan, utilizing the media of the era to reach into new territory. He created a free film program for American schools, prisons and the military, while leveraging the power of media for evangelizing the globe though the use of indigenous clergy. Gospel Films and Zeoli were the executive producers of ''[[How Should We Then Live?|How Should We Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture]].'' The 1977 documentary film series was hosted by the American philosopher and missionary theologian [[Francis Schaeffer]] of [[L'Abri]] fame. The American distribution of the film, an accompanying book, and subsequent film tour in the United States by the Schaeffers' was responsible for bringing many evangelical [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]] into the then largely [[Roman Catholic]] public protest movement against the [[United States Supreme Court]] ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision, {{ussc|410|113|1973}} that supported [[abortion|legal abortion]] in the United States. Francis Schaeffer's son, [[Frank Schaeffer]], with the help of wealthy American evangelical donors (such as [[Amway]] co-founder [[Richard DeVos]]) would go on to make a successful follow-up, entitled ''Whatever Happened to the Human Race''. \n\nOver the decades, Zeoli would helm the many technological transitions in media format, from film to video to DVD and in 1995, launched GospelCom, an innovative Christian website and partnership and hosting portal, where ministries could work together to reach out to their constituencies. In 1998, Gospel Films became Gospel Communications International Inc.  Gospel Communications International developed the [[BibleGateway.com]] web site and also trained and hosted hundreds of evangelical ministries on the World Wide Web beginning in 1995. By the mid 2000's, Zeoli stepped away from day-to-day operations of Gospel Communications and eventually, the 2008 financial crisis contributed to the shuttering of the organization.   \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zeoli, Billy}}\n[[Category:People from Muskegon, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Presidency of Gerald Ford]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Michigan Republicans]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox person\n| honorific_prefix          = \n| name                      = Billy Zeoli\n| honorific_suffix          = \n| native_name               = \n| native_name_lang          = \n| image                     = BillyZeoli.png\n| caption = Billy Zeoli speaking from the podium at the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] Annual Congressional Breakfast, January 28, 1975.

{"title_page": "Bahshamiyya", "text_new": "'''Bahshamiyya''' (also known as \"Ba Hashimiyya\"<ref>Humanism in the renaissance of Islam: the cultural revival during the Buyid Age, by Joel Kramer,{{ISBN|90-04-07259-4}}, {{ISBN|978-90-04-07259-6}}</ref>) is a school of Mu'tazili thought, rivaling the school of [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]], based primarily on the earlier teaching of Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i,<ref>Frank, Richard M. \"The Autonomy of the Human Agent in the Teaching of 'Abd al-Gabbar.\" Le Mus\u00e9on 95(1982): 323\u2013355</ref> the son of [[al-Jubba'i|Abu 'Ali Muhammad al-Jubba'i]].\n\n== Borne from Mu'tazila ==\n[[Mu'tazila]] was a school of rationalist [[Islamic theology]] known as Kalam. Practitioners, Mu'tazil\u00ees, stressed the supremacy of human reason and free-will ''(similar to [[Qadariyya]])'' and went on to develop an epistemology, ontology and psychology which provide a basis for explaining the nature of the world, God, man and religion.  According to Mu'tazilis, good and evil are easily reconciled through human reason without esoteric methods.\n{{Muslim Beliefs|Other}}  \nThe [[Mu'tazila]] school started in the 8th century; its iterative refinement continued from the late 10th century until mid-11th century CE. Mu'tazila was briefly the official theology of the Abbasid caliphs in the 9th century.  Mu'tazila lost out to the al-Maliki School of Sunni Islam and had all but disappeared by the 14th century. The impact of Mu'tazila doctrine impact continued to be felt in primarily three groups: [[Shi'a]] ''([[Ismai'li]])'' Islam, [[Karaite Judaism]], and to a much lesser extent [[Rabbanite]] [[Judaism]] of the ''[[Sephardic]] Rite'' and ''Yemenite rite''.\n\n=== Two Schools ===\n\n{{Location map many | Iraq\n|caption=[[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylon - Centers of Ancient scholarship]]\n| label1=[[Baghdad]]   \n| pos1=right\n| lat1=33.325  | long1= 44.422\n| label2=[[Basra]]   \n| pos2=left\n| lat2=30.5  | long2= 47.816 \n| width=120 | float=right\n}}\nBy the end of the 9th century Mu'tazila had split into two schools:\n\n:1. the ''Baghdad school''  '''Ikhsh\u012bdiyya''' -  followed modifications by ''Abu Yaqub Yusuf al-Shahham'', who adopted the idea of \"acquisition\" (kasb, iktisab), applied it only to involuntary human actions, God-being, in their view, in no way the \"cause\" of free human actions; for al-Jubbai, on the contrary, God retains Supreme Power even over the actions which man performs freely.  But, unlike the later [[Ashari]] notion, [[Al-Jubba'i]] refuses to apply the theory of the kasb to free actions; and he calls man the \"creator\" (Khalik) of his actions, in the sense that man acts, or his actions proceed from him, with a determination (Qadar) which comes from God.  Al-Jubbai had two pupils who later became celebrated 1) his son Abu Hashim and 2) [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Abu'l-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] who, after breaking away, was to devote himself to refuting Mu'tazila and to become the \"founder\" of the so-called school of the [[Ashariyya]]. The traditions of the ''ilm al-kalam'' take pleasure in recounting the dialogue reputed to have brought ''[[Al-Ashari]]'' and his teacher into conflict on the subject of the fate of the \"three brothers\"-one pious, one impious and one who died infans.  In this issue was posed the problem of the rational justification of the divine Decree.  Al-Jubbai was unable to reply with a coherent answer and al-Ashari left him to start his own school.\n\n:2. the ''Basra School''  '''Bahshamiyya''' - see below\n\n===Bahshamiyya ascendance===\nThe Basra school was led by ''Ab\u016b 'Al\u012b al-Jubb\u0101'\u012b'' and his son ''Ab\u016b H\u0101shim''.  Students and followers of ''Ab\u00fb H\u00e2shim'' formed a sub-school known as '''''the Bahshamiyya'''''.  The most noteworthy practitioners were:\n\n1. ''Ab\u016b 'Al\u012b ibn Khall\u0101d''\n\n2. ''Ab\u016b 'Abd All\u0101h al-Basr\u012b''\n\n3. ''Ab\u016b Ish\u0101q ibn 'Ayy\u0101sh''\n\n''[[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad|Abd al-Jabb\u0101r al-Hamad\u0101n\u012b]]'', a judge, was a student of ''Ab\u00fb 'Abd All\u00e2h'' and ''Ab\u00fb Ish\u00e2q'' and a very prolific author of Mu'tazili doctrine. One of '''Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r's'' own students, ''[[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri|Abu'l Husayn al-Basr\u012b]]'', was once thought to establish the last creative school of thought among the Mu'tazila - '''''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'''''.\n\n===Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila and Judaism===\nIn Judaism (Rabbanite and Karaite) ''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'' was adopted in Sura and Pumbeditha Academies of Babylon, in varying degrees, from the 9th century onwards.  Jewish Gaonim composed works which reflected Mu'tazila influence as well as translated many of the Arabic Mu'tazila texts into Hebrew (i.e. Y\u00fbsuf al-Bas\u00eer's ''al-Kit\u00e2b al-Muhtaw\u00ee'' and ''Kit\u00e2b al-Tamy\u00eez'').  The influence of ''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'' quickly became central to Jewish religious and intellectual life in the East - slowly migrating across North Africa with the Fatmimids and making it way to al-Andalus.  Gaonim who embraced ''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'' included ''[[Samuel ben Hofni|Samuel ben Hofni Gaon]]'' who was familiar with the works of ''Ibn Khall\u00e2d'' and ''Ab\u00fb 'Abd All\u00e2h al-Basr\u00ee'' as well as ''[[Saadia Gaon|Saadiah Gaon]]''.\n\nMu'tazil\u00ee doctrines and terminology provided a basis for discussion and polemical exchanges between Jewish and Shi'a scholars.  Virtually banned from Sunn\u00ee Islam, Mu'tazila doctrine remains an integral part of Islamic intellectual history.  The rationalistic approach of Mu'tazila towards reasoned theological issues led to the classification of Mu'tazil\u00ees as ''freethinkers'' within Islam who had been deeply influenced by Greek philosophical thought and thus practiced apostasy and heresy.  A similar attitude was assumed by Tosafists and Kabbalists towards \"[[Jewish Kalam]]\"\n\n===Discovery in Yemen===\nIn the 1950s a number of manuscripts were discovered in the library of the Great Mosque in Sana'a, Yemen.  These contained texts by ''Ab\u00fb H\u00e2shim al-Jubb\u00e2'\u00ee,'' the Bahshamiyya; they also included 14 of 20 volumes of the encyclopedic ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mughn\u00ee f\u00ee abw\u00e2b al-tawh\u00eed wa-l-'adl'' of [[Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r al-Hamadh\u00e2n\u00ee]].  Further writings by followers of the Bahshamiyya School that were found included ''Ta'l\u00eeq sharh al-us\u00fbl al-khamsa'', a recension of the ''Sharh us\u00fbl al-khamsa'' of ''Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r'' by one of his followers, ''M\u00e2nakd\u00eem,'' as well as ''al-Kit\u00e2b al-Majm\u00fb' f\u00ee l-muh\u00eet bi-l-takl\u00eef,'' a recension of Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r's ''al-Kit\u00e2b al-Muh\u00eet bi-l-takl\u00eef'' by ''Ibn Mattawayh.''  However, no texts prior to ''Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r'' were discovered; the same applies to rival groups to the Bahshamiyya such as the Ikhsh\u00eediyya, or the school of Baghdad, whose doctrines were to a large extent formulated by ''Ab\u00fb l-Q\u00e2sim al-Ka'b\u00ee al-Balkh\u00ee.''\n\nIn the Yemen discovery, the Bahshamiyya School was erroneously believed to have constituted the last innovative and dynamic school within Mu'tazilism; Wilferd Madelung and Martin MacDermott discovered fragments of [[Ibn al-Malahimi|Rukn al-Din Mahmud ibn Muhammad al-Mal\u00e2him\u00ee]]'s ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mu'tamad f\u00ee us\u00fbl al-d\u00een''.  Ibn al-Mal\u00e2him\u00ee was a follower of ''[[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri|Ab\u00fb'l-Husayn al-Basr\u00ee]]''.  Examination of ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mu'tamad'' proves that [[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri|Ab\u00fb'l-Husayn al-Basr\u00ee]]'s views differed from those of his teacher ''[[Qadi Abd al-Jabbar]].'' Ibn al-Mal\u00e2him\u00ee's ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mu'tamad'' was published in 1991; ''Kit\u00e2b al-F\u00e2'iq f\u00ee us\u00fbl al-[[D\u012bn]]'' was recently published.\n\n== Opponents of Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Dhammiyya===\nThe ''[[Dhammiyya Shia]]'' was a [[Ghulat]] sect of [[Shia Islam]]. The name ''Dhammiyya'' was derived from the Arabic word ''dhamm'' (to blame).  Therefore, the Arabic name ''Dhammiyya'' is translated as ''The Blamers''.   The \"Blamers\" was used for ''Dhammiyya Shia'' because they believed that:\n\n1. Ali was God, and,\n\n2. Muhammad was his Messenger and Prophet, and,\n\n3.

Practitioners, Mu'tazil\u00ees, stressed the supremacy of human reason and free-will ''(similar to [[Qadariyya]])'' and went on to develop an epistemology, ontology and psychology which provide a basis for explaining the nature of the world, God, man and religion.  According to Mu'tazilis, good and evil are easily reconciled through human reason without esoteric methods.\n{{Muslim Beliefs|Other}}  \nThe [[Mu'tazila]] school started in the 8th century; its iterative refinement continued from the late 10th century until mid-11th century CE. Mu'tazila was briefly the official theology of the Abbasid caliphs in the 9th century.  Mu'tazila lost out to the al-Maliki School of Sunni Islam and had all but disappeared by the 14th century. The impact of Mu'tazila doctrine impact continued to be felt in primarily three groups: [[Shi'a]] ''([[Ismai'li]])'' Islam, [[Karaite Judaism]], and to a much lesser extent [[Rabbanite]] [[Judaism]] of the ''[[Sephardic]] Rite'' and ''Yemenite rite''.\n\n=== Two Schools ===\n\n{{Location map many | Iraq\n|caption=[[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylon - Centers of Ancient scholarship]]\n| label1=[[Baghdad]]   \n| pos1=right\n| lat1=33.325  | long1= 44.422\n| label2=[[Basra]]   \n| pos2=left\n| lat2=30.5  | long2= 47.816 \n| width=120 | float=right\n}}\nBy the end of the 9th century Mu'tazila had split into two schools:\n\n:1. the ''Baghdad school''  '''Ikhsh\u012bdiyya''' -  followed modifications by ''Abu Yaqub Yusuf al-Shahham'', who adopted the idea of \"acquisition\" (kasb, iktisab), applied it only to involuntary human actions, God-being, in their view, in no way the \"cause\" of free human actions; for al-Jubbai, on the contrary, God retains Supreme Power even over the actions which man performs freely.  But, unlike the later [[Ashari]] notion, [[Al-Jubba'i]] refuses to apply the theory of the kasb to free actions; and he calls man the \"creator\" (Khalik) of his actions, in the sense that man acts, or his actions proceed from him, with a determination (Qadar) which comes from God.  Al-Jubbai had two pupils who later became celebrated 1) his son Abu Hashim and 2) [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Abu'l-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] who, after breaking away, was to devote himself to refuting Mu'tazila and to become the \"founder\" of the so-called school of the [[Ashariyya]]. The traditions of the ''ilm al-kalam'' take pleasure in recounting the dialogue reputed to have brought ''[[Al-Ashari]]'' and his teacher into conflict on the subject of the fate of the \"three brothers\"-one pious, one impious and one who died infans.  In this issue was posed the problem of the rational justification of the divine Decree.  Al-Jubbai was unable to reply with a coherent answer and al-Ashari left him to start his own school.\n\n:2. the ''Basra School''  '''Bahshamiyya''' - see below\n\n===Bahshamiyya ascendance===\nThe Basra school was led by ''Ab\u016b 'Al\u012b al-Jubb\u0101'\u012b'' and his son ''Ab\u016b H\u0101shim''.  Students and followers of ''Ab\u00fb H\u00e2shim'' formed a sub-school known as '''''the Bahshamiyya'''''.  The most noteworthy practitioners were:\n\n1. ''Ab\u016b 'Al\u012b ibn Khall\u0101d''\n\n2. ''Ab\u016b 'Abd All\u0101h al-Basr\u012b''\n\n3. ''Ab\u016b Ish\u0101q ibn 'Ayy\u0101sh''\n\n''[[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad|Abd al-Jabb\u0101r al-Hamad\u0101n\u012b]]'', a judge, was a student of ''Ab\u00fb 'Abd All\u00e2h'' and ''Ab\u00fb Ish\u00e2q'' and a very prolific author of Mu'tazili doctrine. One of '''Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r's'' own students, ''[[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri|Abu'l Husayn al-Basr\u012b]]'', was once thought to establish the last creative school of thought among the Mu'tazila - '''''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'''''.\n\n===Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila and Judaism===\nIn Judaism (Rabbanite and Karaite) ''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'' was adopted in Sura and Pumbeditha Academies of Babylon, in varying degrees, from the 9th century onwards.  Jewish Gaonim composed works which reflected Mu'tazila influence as well as translated many of the Arabic Mu'tazila texts into Hebrew (i.e. Y\u00fbsuf al-Bas\u00eer's ''al-Kit\u00e2b al-Muhtaw\u00ee'' and ''Kit\u00e2b al-Tamy\u00eez'').  The influence of ''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'' quickly became central to Jewish religious and intellectual life in the East - slowly migrating across North Africa with the Fatmimids and making it way to al-Andalus.  Gaonim who embraced ''Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila'' included ''[[Samuel ben Hofni|Samuel ben Hofni Gaon]]'' who was familiar with the works of ''Ibn Khall\u00e2d'' and ''Ab\u00fb 'Abd All\u00e2h al-Basr\u00ee'' as well as ''[[Saadia Gaon|Saadiah Gaon]]''.\n\nMu'tazil\u00ee doctrines and terminology provided a basis for discussion and polemical exchanges between Jewish and Shi'a scholars.  Virtually banned from Sunn\u00ee Islam, Mu'tazila doctrine remains an integral part of Islamic intellectual history.  The rationalistic approach of Mu'tazila towards reasoned theological issues led to the classification of Mu'tazil\u00ees as ''freethinkers'' within Islam who had been deeply influenced by Greek philosophical thought and thus practiced apostasy and heresy.  A similar attitude was assumed by Tosafists and Kabbalists towards \"[[Jewish Kalam]]\"\n\n===Discovery in Yemen===\nIn the 1950s a number of manuscripts were discovered in the library of the Great Mosque in Sana'a, Yemen.  These contained texts by ''Ab\u00fb H\u00e2shim al-Jubb\u00e2'\u00ee,'' the Bahshamiyya; they also included 14 of 20 volumes of the encyclopedic ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mughn\u00ee f\u00ee abw\u00e2b al-tawh\u00eed wa-l-'adl'' of [[Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r al-Hamadh\u00e2n\u00ee]].  Further writings by followers of the Bahshamiyya School that were found included ''Ta'l\u00eeq sharh al-us\u00fbl al-khamsa'', a recension of the ''Sharh us\u00fbl al-khamsa'' of ''Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r'' by one of his followers, ''M\u00e2nakd\u00eem,'' as well as ''al-Kit\u00e2b al-Majm\u00fb' f\u00ee l-muh\u00eet bi-l-takl\u00eef,'' a recension of Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r's ''al-Kit\u00e2b al-Muh\u00eet bi-l-takl\u00eef'' by ''Ibn Mattawayh.''  However, no texts prior to ''Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r'' were discovered; the same applies to rival groups to the Bahshamiyya such as the Ikhsh\u00eediyya, or the school of Baghdad, whose doctrines were to a large extent formulated by ''Ab\u00fb l-Q\u00e2sim al-Ka'b\u00ee al-Balkh\u00ee.''\n\nIn the Yemen discovery, the Bahshamiyya School was erroneously believed to have constituted the last innovative and dynamic school within Mu'tazilism; Wilferd Madelung and Martin MacDermott discovered fragments of ''Rukn al-Din Mahmud ibn Muhammad al-Mal\u00e2him\u00ee'''s ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mu'tamad f\u00ee us\u00fbl al-d\u00een''.  ''Ibn al-Mal\u00e2him\u00ee'' was a follower of ''[[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri|Ab\u00fb'l-Husayn al-Basr\u00ee]]''.  Examination of ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mu'tamad'' proves that [[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri|Ab\u00fb'l-Husayn al-Basr\u00ee]]'s views differed from those of his teacher ''[[Qadi Abd al-Jabbar]].'' Ibn al-Mal\u00e2him\u00ee's ''Kit\u00e2b al-Mu'tamad'' was published in 1991; ''Kit\u00e2b al-F\u00e2'iq f\u00ee us\u00fbl al-[[D\u012bn]]'' was recently published.\n\n== Opponents of Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Dhammiyya===\nThe ''[[Dhammiyya Shia]]'' was a [[Ghulat]] sect of [[Shia Islam]]. The name ''Dhammiyya'' was derived from the Arabic word ''dhamm'' (to blame).  Therefore, the Arabic name ''Dhammiyya'' is translated as ''The Blamers''.   The \"Blamers\" was used for ''Dhammiyya Shia'' because they believed that:\n\n1. Ali was God, and,\n\n2. Muhammad was his Messenger and Prophet, and,\n\n3. Muhammad was to be blamed because he was sent by Ali to call the people to Ali, but called them to himself instead.\n\n''Dhammiyya Shia'' was one of the sects that was considered derived from the ''Saba'iyya'' followers of ''Abdullah Ibn Saba''. The sect was also known as the ''Ulyaniyya'' or ''Alya'iyya,'' named after ''Ulyan'' or ''Alya ibn Dhira al-Asdi,'' and appear to have been active around 800 CE.\n\n===Ikhsh\u00eediyya===\nBaghdadi Mu'tazili who fled Sunni Arabia to Egypt for safety under umbra of Shi'a Fatimid protection.\n\n===Kafuriyya===\nIndigenous North African Fatimids who were good enough to be recruited and die as soldiers yet excluded from Arab culture and society due to their skin-color.\n\n===Ka'biyya===\nKa'biyya trace their name and origin to ''Abu'l-Qasim al-Ka'bi'', a native of Baghdad.

It is a relatively large inventory by Lowland Amazonian standards.

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare, /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold, for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories are stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.)

Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* [t\u0361\u0283] alternates with [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare, /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold, for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories are stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.' (Definite)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Mily Crevels (2012). Language Endangerment in South America: The Clock is Ticking In Lyle Campbell & Ver\u00f3nica Grondona.

The series is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]], in association with [[Berlanti Productions]] and Archie Comics. Aguirre-Sacasa and [[Greg Berlanti]] serve as executive producers, alongside [[Sarah Schechter]], Jon Goldwater, and [[Lee Toland Krieger]].\n\nThe series is centered on the [[Archie Comics]] character [[Sabrina Spellman]], portrayed by [[Kiernan Shipka]], and also stars [[Ross Lynch]], [[Lucy Davis]], [[Chance Perdomo]], [[Michelle Gomez]], [[Jaz Sinclair]], [[Tati Gabrielle]], Adeline Rudolph, [[Richard Coyle]], and [[Miranda Otto]]. Originally in development during September 2017 at [[The CW]], the series was intended to be a companion series to ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''; however, in December 2017, the project was moved to Netflix with a straight-to-series order, consisting of twenty episodes. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe first half of the first season, consisting of ten episodes, was released on October 26, 2018. The series received positive reviews, with critics praising Shipka's performance, as well as the premise, visuals, and directing. A [[Christmas special]] episode was released on December 14, 2018, and the second half of the first season was released on April 5, 2019. In December 2018, Netflix renewed the series for a second season consisting of 16 episodes, split into two equal parts, the first of which was released on January 24, 2020.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n[[Sabrina Spellman]] must reconcile her dual nature as a half-Witch, half-mortal while fighting the evil forces that threaten her, her family and the daylight world humans inhabit.<ref name=\"Shipka\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Kiernan Shipka]] as [[Sabrina Spellman]]: A half-human, half-witch teenager attending Baxter High, who is just beginning her dark education, while trying to maintain a normal life.<ref name=\"Shipka\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kiernan-shipka-star-as-sabrina-netflix-riverdale-spinoff-1072044 |title=Kiernan Shipka to Star as Sabrina in Netflix 'Riverdale' Spinoff |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 5, 2018 |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref> [[Mckenna Grace]] plays a young Sabrina Spellman in flashbacks.<ref name=\"McKennaDenisofGoodacre\" />\n* [[Ross Lynch]] as Harvey Kinkle: Sabrina's charming, dreamy boyfriend<!-- Do not change to \"ex-boyfriend\".

He also stated that since both series were already established, a crossover could happen in a standalone film with both casts, potentially titled ''Afterlife with Archie'', based on the [[Archie

People who live as these gender roles have traditionally been accepted by Kiribati society, and are not perceived as immoral or disordered, but as belonging to a third gender alongside male and female.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thirdgendertable.blogspot.com|title=Third Gender Table, A summary of cultures recognizing a third gender, by \"There's a cure for that\"|work=thirdgendertable.blogspot.com|date=8 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://guides.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/Pacificsexualidentity|title=Gender identity and Sexual Identity in the Pacific and Hawai'i: Introduction|work=University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa Library|last=Kleiber|first=Eleanor}}</ref>\n\n==Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity==\nSections 153, 154, and 155 of the Penal Code outlaw [[anal intercourse]] regardless of sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/ki/legis/consol_act/pc66/|title=Kiribati Penal Code|work=paclii.org}}</ref> There are no reports of prosecutions directed against LGBT people under these laws.<ref name=\"Erasing\"/>\n\n153.
