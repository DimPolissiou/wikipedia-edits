The family returned to [[Eltham, London]], in 1907 where he attended Gordon School.  He began playing football as a youth, turning professional in 1924 with [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], where he became the club's regular keeper and made 131 league appearances in four seasons.

He was not initially the Gunners' first team goalkeeper, instead mainly playing as understudy to [[Dan Lewis (footballer)|Dan Lewis]], Arsenal's regular keeper. Preedy made his Arsenal debut on 7 September 1929, against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], and kept a clean sheet as Arsenal won 2-0.\n\nPreedy kept his place after that match but was dropped after a 2-5 defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in November. After that, he was often left out of the team in favour of Lewis, but after Lewis was injured in a 6-6 draw against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], Preedy was picked to play in the [[FA Cup]] Final against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].  Preedy kept a clean sheet and Arsenal won the match 2-0 in front of 100,000 spectators, the first of Arsenal's many successes over the years. He was presented with his winner's medal by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].\n\nArsenal manager [[Herbert Chapman]] was never happy with any of his goalkeepers and in an attempt to fill the role signed both [[Gerard Keizer]] and [[Bill Harper (footballer, born 1897)|Bill Harper]] in the 1930 close season, and then [[Frank Moss (goalkeeper)|Frank Moss]] a year later. Despite intense competition for the goalkeeper's place, Preedy made 25 appearances in the [[1930-31 in English football|1930-31]] and [[1931-32 in English football|1931-32]] seasons, but not enough to win a [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] medal in the former. After an entire season spent as Moss's understudy, Preedy left Arsenal for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in 1933, having played 40 matches for the Gunners. After a season with Rovers he moved to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and finished his career with non-league [[Margate F.C.|Margate]] in 1935. He then followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Jack, and became a London [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver.

It is operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n==History==\nThe beginnings (1986\u20131997)\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled Opportunities in Chemistry. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n===The early years (1997\u20132001)===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n===A maturing program (2001\u20132009)===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultrasensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n===Building for the future (2009 to present)===\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package, NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production.

It is operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n==History==\nThe beginnings (1986\u20131997)\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled Opportunities in Chemistry. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n===The early years (1997\u20132001)===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n===A maturing program (2001\u20132009)===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultrasensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n===Building for the future (2009 to present)===\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package, NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

He was also the last governor of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and duke of Luxembourg. An able soldier, his ambition led to conflicts that limited his ultimate dynastic achievements.\n\nHe was born in Munich to [[Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria]] and [[Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy]] (d.1676). His maternal grandparents were [[Victor Amadeus I of Savoy]] and [[Christine Marie of France]], daughter of King [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]].\n\n==War against the Ottoman Empire==\nMaximilian inherited the elector's mantle while still a minor in 1679 and remained under his uncle [[Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus, Prince of Bavaria|Maximilian Philipp]]'s regency until 1680. By 1683 he was already embarked on a military career, fighting in the defense of Vienna against the attempt of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to extend their possessions further into Europe. He returned to court for long enough to marry [[Maria Antonia of Austria (1669-1692)|Maria Antonia]], daughter of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Margaret Theresa of Spain]], on 15 July 1685 in Vienna, Austria. This marriage was very unhappy since the couple disliked each other, but it was successful in producing a desired heir for both Bavaria and the Spanish monarchy.  Maximilian Emanuel's fame was assured when, in 1688, he led the [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|capture of Belgrade]] from the Turks, with the full support of Serbian insurgents under the command of Jovan Monasterlija.<ref name=\"Wilson2002\">{{cite book|author=Peter Wilson|title=German Armies: War and German Society, 1648-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_WNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA363|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-37053-4|pages=68\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"MSc2014\">{{cite book|author1=Derek Mckay|author2=H.M.

In October 1698, [[William III of England]] and [[Louis XIV of France]] concluded the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|First Partition Treaty]], which gave the Spanish crown with the Indies to Joseph Ferdinand, Milan to Emperor Joseph's younger son Archduke Charles, and the rest of Spanish Italy to France.

However, when Theresa Kunegunda had found love letters of the Countess of Arco, a mistress of Max Emanuel, she left Munich to see her mother in Venice. The army would not allow her to return. In the ensuing evacuation of his court to the Netherlands, Maximilian Emanuel's family became separated and his sons were held prisoners for several years in Austria, Klemens August being brought up by [[Jesuits]]. Bavaria was partitioned between Austria and [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine]].

He was also the last governor of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and duke of Luxembourg. An able soldier, his ambition led to conflicts that limited his ultimate dynastic achievements.\n\nHe was born in Munich to [[Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria]] and [[Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy]] (d.1676). His maternal grandparents were [[Victor Amadeus I of Savoy]] and [[Christine Marie of France]], daughter of King [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]].\n\n==War against the Ottoman Empire==\nMaximilian inherited the elector's mantle while still a minor in 1679 and remained under his uncle [[Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus, Prince of Bavaria|Maximilian Philipp]]'s regency until 1680. By 1683 he was already embarked on a military career, fighting in the defense of Vienna against the attempt of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to extend their possessions further into Europe. He returned to court for long enough to marry [[Maria Antonia of Austria (1669-1692)|Maria Antonia]], daughter of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Margaret Theresa of Spain]], on 15 July 1685 in Vienna, Austria. This marriage was very unhappy since the couple disliked each other, but it was successful in producing a desired heir for both Bavaria and the Spanish monarchy.  Maximilian Emanuel's fame was assured when, in 1688, he led the [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|capture of Belgrade]] from the Turks, with the full support of Serbian insurgents under the command of Jovan Monasterlija.<ref name=\"Wilson2002\">{{cite book|author=Peter Wilson|title=German Armies: War and German Society, 1648-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_WNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA363|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-37053-4|pages=68\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"MSc2014\">{{cite book|author1=Derek Mckay|author2=H.M.

One year after his appointment as governor, Maria Antonia died in Vienna, having given birth to a son, [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria|Joseph Ferdinand]], who was appointed heir to the Spanish monarchy, but died before acceding thereto in 1699. An alternative avenue for Maximilian Emanuel's ambition was offered by his marriage on 12 January 1694 to [[Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska]], the death of whose father, the elected King of Poland [[John III of Poland|John III Sobieski]], two years later, offered a potential avenue of influence in Polish affairs.<ref name=\"Kruedener2020\">{{cite book|author=Claudia von Kruedener|title=Kurf\u00fcrstin Therese Kunigunde von Bayern (1676\u20131730): und ihre Friedenspolitik in europ\u00e4ischen Dimensionen zwischen Papst und Kaiser|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyTYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA401|date=23 March 2020|publisher=Verlag Friedrich Pustet|isbn=978-3-7917-7281-3|pages=61\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, he concentrated his interests in [[Western Europe]], making his sons by Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, [[Charles VII Albert|Charles Albert]] and [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], the principal beneficiaries of his ambitions.\n\nThe unsuccessful siege and [[bombardment of Brussels]] in 1695 during the [[Nine Years' War]] by French troops and the resulting fire during Max Emanuel's rule were together the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels.<ref name=\"MSc2014\"/>\n\n==War of the Spanish Succession==\n[[Image:Max II Emanuel family v2.png|left|thumbnail|300px|Family tree]]\nMaximilian Emanuel, who had married [[Maria Antonia of Austria|Archduchess Maria Antonia]], the sole child of Emperor Leopold's Spanish marriage, was one of the more serious claimants to the Spanish inheritance of [[Charles II of Spain]], and the birth of his son [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria|Joseph Ferdinand]] in October 1692 immediately created a new pretender to the Spanish throne. In October 1698, [[William III of England]] and [[Louis XIV of France]] concluded the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|First Partition Treaty]], which gave the Spanish crown with the Indies to Joseph Ferdinand, Milan to Emperor Joseph's younger son Archduke Charles, and the rest of Spanish Italy to France. The unexpected death of Joseph Ferdinand four months later voided this plan and in the [[Treaty of London (1700)|Second Partition Treaty]], the Bavarian portion of the inheritance was allotted to Archduke Charles.<ref>Joachim Whaley, ''Germany and the Holy Roman Empire'', volume II, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 108\u2013109.</ref> By the outbreak of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701, Maximilian Emanuel, who had long-term imperial aspirations, had hoped that his governorship of the Spanish Netherlands might yet reap the reward of a share of the Spanish inheritance from either Leopold or, failing him, Louis XIV.<ref>Joachim Whaley, p. 115.</ref> Allying himself with the French against Austria, his campaign against [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] in 1703 did not have success and his plans were then frustrated by the disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704.\n\nIn 1704\u201305, following the evacuation of the Bavarian court to the Spanish Netherlands after the defeat at the Battle of Blenheim, Max Emanuel's consort apparently was in charge of the government in the Stewardship of Munich of the Electorate of Bavaria as Regent Princess. However, when Theresa Kunegunda had found love letters of the Countess of Arco, a mistress of Max Emanuel, she left Munich to see her mother in Venice. The army would not allow her to return. In the ensuing evacuation of his court to the Netherlands, Maximilian Emanuel's family became separated and his sons were held prisoners for several years in Austria, Klemens August being brought up by [[Jesuits]]. Bavaria was partitioned between Austria and [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine]].

In 1712, Luxemburg and [[County of Namur|Namur]] were ceded to Maximilian Emanuel by his French allies, a cession that was not definitive since France was only the occupant of what was still the Spanish Netherlands.
