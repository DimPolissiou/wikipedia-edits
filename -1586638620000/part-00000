This article mainly concerns novels, written in English, by [[novelist]]s who were born or have spent a significant part of their lives in England, or Scotland, or Wales, or [[Northern Ireland]] (or Ireland before 1922). However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to novels in other languages or novelists who are not primarily [[British people|British]] where appropriate.\n\n==Early novels in English==\n{{Main|First novel in English}}\nThe English novel has generally been seen as beginning with [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' (1722),<ref>\"Defoe\", ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxforsd University Press,1996), p. 265.</ref> though John Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) and [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Oroonoko]]'' (1688) are also contenders, while earlier works such as [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'', and even the \"Prologue\" to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' have been suggested.<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1984), pp. 433, 434.</ref> Another important early novel is ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726, amended 1735), by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and clergyman [[Jonathan Swift]], which is both a [[satire]] of human nature, as well as a [[parody]] of travellers' tales like ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.<ref>http://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/gullivers-travels/author/dean-swift/sortby/3/</ref> The rise of the novel as an important literary genre is generally associated with the growth of the middle class in England.\n\n'''''First novel Pamela or Virtue Rewarded'''''.\n\nOther major 18th-century English novelists are [[Samuel Richardson]] (1689\u20131761), author of the [[epistolary novel]]s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1747\u201348); [[Henry Fielding]] (1707\u20131754), who wrote ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' (1749); [[Laurence Sterne]] (1713\u20131768), who published ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' in parts between 1759 and 1767;<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 947.</ref> [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (1728\u20131774), author of ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766); [[Tobias Smollett]] (1721\u20131771), a Scottish novelist best known for his comic [[picaresque novel]]s, such as ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'' (1751) and ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' (1771), who influenced [[Charles Dickens]];<ref>{{citation|title= British Literature 1640\u20131789: An Anthology|author= Robert DeMaria|year= 2001|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|isbn= 0-631-21769-X|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/britishliteratur0000unse}}</ref> and [[Fanny Burney]] (1752\u20131840), whose novels \"were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen,\" wrote ''[[Evelina]]'' (1778), ''Cecilia'' (1782) and ''[[Camilla (Burney novel)|Camilla]]'' (1796).<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p. 151.</ref>\n\nA noteworthy aspect of both the 18th- and 19th- century novel is the way the novelist directly addressed the reader. For example, the author might interrupt his or her narrative to pass judgment on a character, or pity or praise another, and inform or remind the reader of some other relevant issue.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Romantic period==\n{{Main|Romantic literature in English}}\n[[File:Walter Scott - Project Gutenberg eText 18396.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Walter Scott]]\nThe phrase Romantic novel has several possible meanings. Here it refers to novels written during the [[Romantic era]] in literary history, which runs from the late 18th century until the beginning of the Victorian era in 1837. But to complicate matters there are novels written in the romance tradition by novelists like [[Walter Scott]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[George Meredith]].<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth:Penguin Books, 1984), p. 582.</ref> In addition the phrase today is mostly used to refer to the popular [[pulp-fiction]] genre that focusses on romantic love. The Romantic period is especially associated with the poets [[William Blake]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[George Byron]], [[Percy Shelley]] and [[John Keats]], though two major novelists, [[Jane Austen]] and [[Walter Scott]], also published in the early 19th century.\n\n[[Horace Walpole]]'s 1764 novel, ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', invented the [[Gothic fiction]] genre. The word gothic was originally used in the sense of [[medieval]].<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 289.</ref> This genre combines \"the macabre, fantastic, and supernatural\" and usually involves haunted castles, graveyards and various picturesque elements.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p. 411.</ref> Later novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic [[villain]] which developed into the [[Byronic hero]]. Her most popular and influential work, ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), is frequently described as the archetypal Gothic novel. ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], and ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796), by [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], were further notable early works in both the Gothic and horror genres.\n\n[[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), as another important [[Gothic novel]] as well as being an early example of [[science fiction]].<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 886.</ref> \nThe [[vampire literature|vampire genre]] fiction began with [[John William Polidori]]'s ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of [[Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. An important later work is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the \"sympathetic vampire\", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.<ref>Skal, David J. (1996). ''V is for Vampire'', p. 99. New York: Plume. {{ISBN|0-452-27173-8}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley Rothwell.tif|left|thumb|upright|[[Mary Shelley]]]]\nAmong more minor novelists in this period [[Maria Edgeworth]] (1768\u20131849) and [[Thomas Love Peacock]] (1785\u20131866) are worthy of comment. Edgeworth's novel ''[[Castle Rackrent]]'' (1800) is \"the first fully developed regional novel in English\" as well as \"the first true [[historical novel]] in English\" and an important influence on Walter Scott.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 310.</ref> Peacock was primarily a satirist in novels such as ''[[Nightmare Abbey]]'' (1818) and ''[[The Misfortunes of Elphin]]'' (1829).\n\n[[Jane Austen]]'s (1775\u20131817) works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism.<ref>Litz, pp. 3\u201314; Grundy, \"Jane Austen and Literary Traditions\", ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', pp. 192\u2013193; Waldron, \"Critical Responses, Early\", ''Jane Austen in Context'', pp. 83, 89\u201390; Duffy, \"Criticism, 1814\u20131870\", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', pp. 93\u201394.</ref> Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.<ref>A. Walton Litz, ''Jane Austen: A Study of Her Development''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1965. p. 142; Oliver MacDonagh, ''Jane Austen: Real and Imagined Worlds''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. pp. 66\u201375; Collins, 160\u2013161.</ref> Austen brings to light the hardships women faced, who usually did not inherit money, could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married. She reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day, but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow. This she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters, good or bad, receive exactly what they deserve.  Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a [[Janeite]] fan culture. Austen's  works include ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]''. \n\nThe other major novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was [[Sir Walter Scott]] (1771\u20131832), who was not only a highly successful British novelist but \"the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century ... [and] a European figure\".<ref>J. A. Cuddon, p. 435.</ref> Scott established the genre of the [[historical novel]] with his series of  [[Waverley Novels]], including ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814), ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (1816), and ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818).<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 890.</ref> However, Austen is today widely read and the source for films and television series, while Scott is less often read.\n\n==Victorian novel==\n\nIt was in the [[Victorian era]] (1837\u20131901) that the novel became the leading [[literary genre]] in English. Another important fact is the number of women novelists who were successful in the 19th century, even though they often had to use a masculine pseudonym. At the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes. However, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens' ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'' in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837. Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers' interest. Both Dickens and Thackeray frequently published this way.<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), pp. 97\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe 1830s and 1840s saw the rise of [[social novel]], also known as social problem novel,  that \"arose out of the social and political upheavals which followed the [[Reform Act of 1832]]\".<ref>''Bloomsbury Guide'', p. 101.</ref> This was in many ways a reaction to  rapid [[industrialization]], and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and was a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England's economic prosperity.<ref>\"James, Louis(2006)\"</ref> Stories of the working class poor were directed toward middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. An early example is [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837\u201338).\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens 3.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Charles Dickens]]]]\n[[Charles Dickens]] emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and struggles of the poor,  but in a good-humoured fashion, accessible to readers of all classes. One of his most popular works to this day is  ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843). In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846\u201348), ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1860\u201361), ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852\u201353) and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' (1855\u201357) and ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (1864\u201365). An early rival to Dickens was [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1847). In that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch. It features his most memorable character, the engagingly roguish Becky Sharp. \n\nThe [[Bront\u00eb]] sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published but were subsequently accepted as classics. They had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published, at their own expense in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The sisters returned to prose, producing a novel each the following year: Charlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and Anne's ''[[Agnes Grey]]''. Later, Anne's ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) and Charlotte's ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' (1853) were published. [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] was also a successful writer and first novel, ''[[Mary Barton]]'', was published anonymously in 1848. Gaskell's ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, Gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes: her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She always emphasised the role of women, with complex narratives and dynamic female characters.<ref>Abrams, M.H., et al. (Eds.) \"Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810\u20131865\".

LC PR1109.N6.</ref> \n\n[[Anthony Trollope]] (1815\u201382) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era.  Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary county of [[Barsetshire]], including ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855) and ''[[Barchester Towers]]'' (1857). He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters, including ''The Way with Live Now'' (1875). Trollope's novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England. \n\n[[George Eliot]]'s (Mary Ann Evans (1819\u201380) first novel ''[[Adam Bede]]'' was published in 1859. Her works, especially ''[[Middlemarch]]'' 1871\u201372), are important examples of [[literary realism]], and are admired for their combination of high [[Victorian literature|Victorian literary]] detail combined with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict.\n\n[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|H. G. Wells studying in London, taken c. 1890]]\nAn interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of [[Thomas Hardy]] (1840\u20131928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of [[George Eliot]], he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by [[Romanticism]], especially by [[William Wordsworth]].<ref>Dennis Taylor, \"Hardy and Wordsworth\". Victorian Poetry, vol.24, no.4, Winter, 1986.</ref> [[Charles Darwin]] is another important influence on Thomas Hardy.<ref>Gillian Beer, ''Darwin's Plots''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009.</ref> Like Charles Dickens he was also highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focussed more on a declining rural society. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life, and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898, so that initially he gained fame as the author of such novels as, ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886),  ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), and ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' (1895). He ceased writing novels following adverse criticism of this last novel. In novels such as ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' and ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' Hardy attempts to create modern works in the genre of [[tragedy]], that are modelled on the Greek drama, especially [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], though in prose, not poetry, a novel not drama, and with characters of low social standing, not nobility.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/pva187.html  \"Aristotelian Tragedy and the Novels of Thomas Hardy\"]</ref> Another significant late 19th-century novelist is [[George Gissing]] (1857\u20131903) who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best known novel is ''[[New Grub Street]]'' (1891).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nImportant developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866\u20131946) writing career began in the 1890s with [[science fiction]] novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828\u20131905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).\n\n==20th century==\nThe major novelists writing in Britain at the start of the 20th century were an Irishman [[James Joyce]] (1882\u20131941) and two immigrants, American [[Henry James]] (1843\u20131916) and Pole [[Joseph Conrad]] (1857\u20131924){{Citation needed|reason=Joyce's first novel was not published until 1914, nor was he even living - let alone writing - in Britain during the early 20th century.|date=July 2018}}. The modernist tradition in the novel, with its emphasis \"towards the ever more minute and analytic exposition of mental life\", begins with James and Conrad, in novels such as ''[[The Ambassadors]]'' (1903), ''[[The Golden Bowl]]'' (1907) and ''[[Lord Jim]]'' (1900).<ref>John Carruthers, ''Scheherazade: or the Future of the English Novel'' (1928), quoted in Randall Stevenson,''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction''. (Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992) pp. 18, 19, 22.</ref> Other important early modernists were [[Dorothy Richardson]] (1873\u20131957), whose novel ''Pointed Roof'' (1915), is one of the earliest example of the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique and [[D. H. Lawrence]] (1885\u20131930), who wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes, and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'' (1913), is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915), though it was immediately seized by the police, and its sequel ''[[Women in Love]]'' published in 1920.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'',  p. 562.</ref> Lawrence attempted to explore human emotions more deeply than his contemporaries and challenged the boundaries of the acceptable treatment of sexual issues, most notably in ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which was privately published in Florence in 1928. However, the unexpurgated version of this novel was not published until 1959.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 562.</ref> Then in 1922 Irishman [[James Joyce]]'s important modernist novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' appeared.

(New York: Prentice Hall, 19900, p. 644.</ref>\n\nAnother significant modernist in the 1920s was [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882\u20131941), who was an influential feminist and a major stylistic innovator associated with the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] technique. Her novels include ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925), ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' (1927), and ''[[The Waves]]'' (1931). Her essay collection ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) contains her famous dictum; \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\".<ref>''The Cambridge companion to Virginia Woolf''.

This include [[E.M. Forster]] ((1879\u20131970), [[John Galsworthy]] ((1867\u20131933) ([[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, 1932), whose novels include ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'', [[Arnold Bennett]] (1867\u20131931) author of ''[[The Old Wives' Tale]]'', and [[H. G. Wells]] (1866\u20131946). Though Forster's work is \"frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements\".<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davies (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 118.</ref>   [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924), reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier works such as ''[[A Room with a View]]'' (1908) and ''[[Howards End]]'' (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of [[Edwardian]] society in England. The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably [[Rudyard Kipling]] ((1865\u20131936), a highly versatile [[writer of novels]], short stories and poems and to date the youngest ever recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (1907).\n\nA significant English writer in the 1930s and 1940s was [[George Orwell]] (1903\u201350), who is especially remembered for his satires of totalitarianism, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945). [[Evelyn Waugh]] (1903\u201366) satirised the \"bright young things\" of the 1920s and 1930s, notably in ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'' (1934), and ''[[Decline and Fall]]'' (1928), while  ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1945) has a theological basis, setting out to examine the effect of divine grace on its main characters.<ref>Memo dated 18 February 1947 from Evelyn Waugh to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], reproduced in {{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/22/classics.film#down | title = Waugh versus Hollywood | date = 22 May 2004 | author = [[Giles Foden]] | newspaper = The Guardian | page = 34 }}</ref> [[Aldous Huxley]] (1894\u20131963) published his famous [[dystopia]] ''[[Brave New World]]'' in 1932, the same year as [[John Cowper Powys]]'s (1872\u20131963) ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]''. [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906\u201389) published his first major work, the novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'' in 1938.

Greene was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include, ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' (1948), ''[[A Burnt-Out Case]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Human Factor (Graham Greene book)|The Human Factor]]'' (1978). [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s (1903\u201366) career also continued after World War II, and in \"1961 he completed his most considerable work, a trilogy about the war entitled ''[[Sword of Honour]]''.<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed.

Her works including ''[[Under the Net]]'' (1954), ''The Black Prince'' (1973) and ''The Green Knight'' (1993). Scottish writer [[Muriel Spark]]'s also began publishing in the 1950s. She pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels.

[[Anthony Burgess]] is especially remembered for his [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]] ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of [[Gothic fantasy]] [[Mervyn Peake]] (1911\u201368) published his highly successful [[Gormenghast trilogy]] between 1946 and 1959.\n\nImmigrant authors played a major role in post-war literature. [[Doris Lessing]] (1919) from [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), published her first novel ''The Grass is Singing'' in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the Nobel prize for literature in 2007. [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947) is another among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' 1981, which was awarded both the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and [[Booker prize]], and named [[The Best of the Booker|Booker of Bookers]] in 1993. His most controversial novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1989), was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. [[V. S. Naipaul]] (born 1932), born in [[Trinidad]], was another immigrant, who wrote among other things ''A House for Mr Biswas'' (1961) and ''[[A Bend in the River]]'' (1979). Naipaul won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=\"nobelweb\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2001/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2001|publisher=Nobelprize.org}}</ref> Also from the [[West Indies]] [[George Lamming]] (born 1927) is best remembered for ''In the Castle of the Skin'' (1953).

This article mainly concerns novels, written in English, by [[novelist]]s who were born or have spent a significant part of their lives in England, or Scotland, or Wales, or [[Northern Ireland]] (or Ireland before 1922). However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to novels in other languages or novelists who are not primarily [[British people|British]] where appropriate.\n\n==Early novels in English==\n{{Main|First novel in English}}\nThe English novel has generally been seen as beginning with [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' (1722),<ref>\"Defoe\", ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxforsd University Press,1996), p. 265.</ref> though John Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) and [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Oroonoko]]'' (1688) are also contenders, while earlier works such as [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'', and even the \"Prologue\" to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' have been suggested.<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1984), pp. 433, 434.</ref> Another important early novel is ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726, amended 1735), by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and clergyman [[Jonathan Swift]], which is both a [[satire]] of human nature, as well as a [[parody]] of travellers' tales like ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.<ref>http://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/gullivers-travels/author/dean-swift/sortby/3/</ref> The rise of the novel as an important literary genre is generally associated with the growth of the middle class in England.\n\n'''''First novel Pamela or Virtue Rewarded'''''.\n\nOther major 18th-century English novelists are [[Samuel Richardson]] (1689\u20131761), author of the [[epistolary novel]]s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1747\u201348); [[Henry Fielding]] (1707\u20131754), who wrote ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' (1749); [[Laurence Sterne]] (1713\u20131768), who published ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' in parts between 1759 and 1767;<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 947.</ref> [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (1728\u20131774), author of ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766); [[Tobias Smollett]] (1721\u20131771), a Scottish novelist best known for his comic [[picaresque novel]]s, such as ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'' (1751) and ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' (1771), who influenced [[Charles Dickens]];<ref>{{citation|title= British Literature 1640\u20131789: An Anthology|author= Robert DeMaria|year= 2001|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|isbn= 0-631-21769-X|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/britishliteratur0000unse}}</ref> and [[Fanny Burney]] (1752\u20131840), whose novels \"were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen,\" wrote ''[[Evelina]]'' (1778), ''Cecilia'' (1782) and ''[[Camilla (Burney novel)|Camilla]]'' (1796).<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p. 151.</ref>\n\nA noteworthy aspect of both the 18th- and 19th- century novel is the way the novelist directly addressed the reader. For example, the author might interrupt his or her narrative to pass judgment on a character, or pity or praise another, and inform or remind the reader of some other relevant issue.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Romantic period==\n{{Main|Romantic literature in English}}\n[[File:Walter Scott - Project Gutenberg eText 18396.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Walter Scott]]\nThe phrase Romantic novel has several possible meanings. Here it refers to novels written during the [[Romantic era]] in literary history, which runs from the late 18th century until the beginning of the Victorian era in 1837. But to complicate matters there are novels written in the romance tradition by novelists like [[Walter Scott]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[George Meredith]].<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth:Penguin Books, 1984), p. 582.</ref> In addition the phrase today is mostly used to refer to the popular [[pulp-fiction]] genre that focusses on romantic love. The Romantic period is especially associated with the poets [[William Blake]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[George Byron]], [[Percy Shelley]] and [[John Keats]], though two major novelists, [[Jane Austen]] and [[Walter Scott]], also published in the early 19th century.\n\n[[Horace Walpole]]'s 1764 novel, ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', invented the [[Gothic fiction]] genre. The word gothic was originally used in the sense of [[medieval]].<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 289.</ref> This genre combines \"the macabre, fantastic, and supernatural\" and usually involves haunted castles, graveyards and various picturesque elements.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p. 411.</ref> Later novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic [[villain]] which developed into the [[Byronic hero]]. Her most popular and influential work, ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), is frequently described as the archetypal Gothic novel. ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], and ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796), by [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], were further notable early works in both the Gothic and horror genres.\n\n[[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), as another important [[Gothic novel]] as well as being an early example of [[science fiction]].<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 886.</ref> \nThe [[vampire literature|vampire genre]] fiction began with [[John William Polidori]]'s ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of [[Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. An important later work is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the \"sympathetic vampire\", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.<ref>Skal, David J. (1996). ''V is for Vampire'', p. 99. New York: Plume. {{ISBN|0-452-27173-8}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley Rothwell.tif|left|thumb|upright|[[Mary Shelley]]]]\nAmong more minor novelists in this period [[Maria Edgeworth]] (1768\u20131849) and [[Thomas Love Peacock]] (1785\u20131866) are worthy of comment. Edgeworth's novel ''[[Castle Rackrent]]'' (1800) is \"the first fully developed regional novel in English\" as well as \"the first true [[historical novel]] in English\" and an important influence on Walter Scott.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 310.</ref> Peacock was primarily a satirist in novels such as ''[[Nightmare Abbey]]'' (1818) and ''[[The Misfortunes of Elphin]]'' (1829).\n\n[[Jane Austen]]'s (1775\u20131817) works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism.<ref>Litz, pp. 3\u201314; Grundy, \"Jane Austen and Literary Traditions\", ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', pp. 192\u2013193; Waldron, \"Critical Responses, Early\", ''Jane Austen in Context'', pp. 83, 89\u201390; Duffy, \"Criticism, 1814\u20131870\", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', pp. 93\u201394.</ref> Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.<ref>A. Walton Litz, ''Jane Austen: A Study of Her Development''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1965. p. 142; Oliver MacDonagh, ''Jane Austen: Real and Imagined Worlds''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. pp. 66\u201375; Collins, 160\u2013161.</ref> Austen brings to light the hardships women faced, who usually did not inherit money, could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married. She reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day, but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow. This she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters, good or bad, receive exactly what they deserve.  Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a [[Janeite]] fan culture. Austen's  works include ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]''. \n\nThe other major novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was [[Sir Walter Scott]] (1771\u20131832), who was not only a highly successful British novelist but \"the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century ... [and] a European figure\".<ref>J. A. Cuddon, p. 435.</ref> Scott established the genre of the [[historical novel]] with his series of  [[Waverley Novels]], including ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814), ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (1816), and ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818).<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 890.</ref> However, Austen is today widely read and the source for films and television series, while Scott is less often read.\n\n==Victorian novel==\n\nIt was in the [[Victorian era]] (1837\u20131901) that the novel became the leading [[literary genre]] in English. Another important fact is the number of women novelists who were successful in the 19th century, even though they often had to use a masculine pseudonym. At the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes. However, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens' ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'' in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837. Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers' interest. Both Dickens and Thackeray frequently published this way.<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), pp. 97\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe 1830s and 1840s saw the rise of [[social novel]], also known as social problem novel,  that \"arose out of the social and political upheavals which followed the [[Reform Act of 1832]]\".<ref>''Bloomsbury Guide'', p. 101.</ref> This was in many ways a reaction to  rapid [[industrialization]], and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and was a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England's economic prosperity.<ref>\"James, Louis(2006)\"</ref> Stories of the working class poor were directed toward middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. An early example is [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837\u201338).\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens 3.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Charles Dickens]]]]\n[[Charles Dickens]] emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and struggles of the poor,  but in a good-humoured fashion, accessible to readers of all classes. One of his most popular works to this day is  ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843). In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846\u201348), ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1860\u201361), ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852\u201353) and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' (1855\u201357) and ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (1864\u201365). An early rival to Dickens was [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1847). In that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch. It features his most memorable character, the engagingly roguish Becky Sharp. \n\nThe [[Bront\u00eb]] sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published but were subsequently accepted as classics. They had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published, at their own expense in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The sisters returned to prose, producing a novel each the following year: Charlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and Anne's ''[[Agnes Grey]]''. Later, Anne's ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) and Charlotte's ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' (1853) were published. [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] was also a successful writer and first novel, ''[[Mary Barton]]'', was published anonymously in 1848. Gaskell's ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, Gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes: her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She always emphasised the role of women, with complex narratives and dynamic female characters.<ref>Abrams, M.H., et al. (Eds.) \"Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810\u20131865\".

LC PR1109.N6.</ref> \n\n[[Anthony Trollope]] (1815\u201382) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era.  Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary county of [[Barsetshire]], including ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855) and ''[[Barchester Towers]]'' (1857). He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters, including ''The Way with Live Now'' (1875). Trollope's novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England. \n\n[[George Eliot]]'s (Mary Ann Evans (1819\u201380) first novel ''[[Adam Bede]]'' was published in 1859. Her works, especially ''[[Middlemarch]]'' 1871\u201372), are important examples of [[literary realism]], and are admired for their combination of high [[Victorian literature|Victorian literary]] detail combined with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict.\n\n[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|H. G. Wells studying in London, taken c. 1890]]\nAn interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of [[Thomas Hardy]] (1840\u20131928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of [[George Eliot]], he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by [[Romanticism]], especially by [[William Wordsworth]].<ref>Dennis Taylor, \"Hardy and Wordsworth\". Victorian Poetry, vol.24, no.4, Winter, 1986.</ref> [[Charles Darwin]] is another important influence on Thomas Hardy.<ref>Gillian Beer, ''Darwin's Plots''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009.</ref> Like Charles Dickens he was also highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focussed more on a declining rural society. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life, and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898, so that initially he gained fame as the author of such novels as, ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886),  ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), and ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' (1895). He ceased writing novels following adverse criticism of this last novel. In novels such as ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' and ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' Hardy attempts to create modern works in the genre of [[tragedy]], that are modelled on the Greek drama, especially [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], though in prose, not poetry, a novel not drama, and with characters of low social standing, not nobility.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/pva187.html  \"Aristotelian Tragedy and the Novels of Thomas Hardy\"]</ref> Another significant late 19th-century novelist is [[George Gissing]] (1857\u20131903) who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best known novel is ''[[New Grub Street]]'' (1891).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nImportant developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866\u20131946) writing career began in the 1890s with [[science fiction]] novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828\u20131905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).\n\n==20th century==\nThe major novelists writing in Britain at the start of the 20th century were an Irishman [[James Joyce]] (1882\u20131941) and two immigrants, American [[Henry James]] (1843\u20131916) and Pole [[Joseph Conrad]] (1857\u20131924){{Citation needed|reason=Joyce's first novel was not published until 1914, nor was he even living - let alone writing - in Britain during the early 20th century.|date=July 2018}}. The modernist tradition in the novel, with its emphasis \"towards the ever more minute and analytic exposition of mental life\", begins with James and Conrad, in novels such as ''[[The Ambassadors]]'' (1903), ''[[The Golden Bowl]]'' (1907) and ''[[Lord Jim]]'' (1900).<ref>John Carruthers, ''Scheherazade: or the Future of the English Novel'' (1928), quoted in Randall Stevenson,''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction''. (Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992) pp. 18, 19, 22.</ref> Other important early modernists were [[Dorothy Richardson]] (1873\u20131957), whose novel ''Pointed Roof'' (1915), is one of the earliest example of the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique and [[D. H. Lawrence]] (1885\u20131930), who wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes, and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'' (1913), is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915), though it was immediately seized by the police, and its sequel ''[[Women in Love]]'' published in 1920.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'',  p. 562.</ref> Lawrence attempted to explore human emotions more deeply than his contemporaries and challenged the boundaries of the acceptable treatment of sexual issues, most notably in ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which was privately published in Florence in 1928. However, the unexpurgated version of this novel was not published until 1959.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 562.</ref> Then in 1922 Irishman [[James Joyce]]'s important modernist novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' appeared.

Her novels include ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925), ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' (1927), and ''[[The Waves]]'' (1931). Her essay collection ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) contains her famous dictum; \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\".<ref>''The Cambridge companion to Virginia Woolf''.

This include [[E.M. Forster]] ((1879\u20131970), [[John Galsworthy]] ((1867\u20131933) ([[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, 1932), whose novels include ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'', [[Arnold Bennett]] (1867\u20131931) author of ''[[The Old Wives' Tale]]'', and [[H. G. Wells]] (1866\u20131946). Though Forster's work is \"frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements\".<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davies (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 118.</ref>   [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924), reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier works such as ''[[A Room with a View]]'' (1908) and ''[[Howards End]]'' (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of [[Edwardian]] society in England. The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably [[Rudyard Kipling]] ((1865\u20131936), a highly versatile [[writer of novels]], short stories and poems and to date the youngest ever recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (1907).\n\nA significant English writer in the 1930s and 1940s was [[George Orwell]] (1903\u201350), who is especially remembered for his satires of totalitarianism, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945). [[Evelyn Waugh]] (1903\u201366) satirised the \"bright young things\" of the 1920s and 1930s, notably in ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'' (1934), and ''[[Decline and Fall]]'' (1928), while  ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1945) has a theological basis, setting out to examine the effect of divine grace on its main characters.<ref>Memo dated 18 February 1947 from Evelyn Waugh to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], reproduced in {{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/22/classics.film#down | title = Waugh versus Hollywood | date = 22 May 2004 | author = [[Giles Foden]] | newspaper = The Guardian | page = 34 }}</ref> [[Aldous Huxley]] (1894\u20131963) published his famous [[dystopia]] ''[[Brave New World]]'' in 1932, the same year as [[John Cowper Powys]]'s (1872\u20131963) ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]''. [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906\u201389) published his first major work, the novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'' in 1938. This same year [[Graham Greene]]'s (1904\u201391) first major novel ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'' was published. Then in 1939 [[James Joyce]] published ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

H. Lawrence]], 1906]]\n[[Graham Greene]] was an important novelist whose works span the 1930s to the 1980s. Greene was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include, ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' (1948), ''[[A Burnt-Out Case]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Human Factor (Graham Greene book)|The Human Factor]]'' (1978). [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s (1903\u201366) career also continued after World War II, and in \"1961 he completed his most considerable work, a trilogy about the war entitled ''[[Sword of Honour]]''.<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 1008.</ref> In 1947 [[Malcolm Lowry]] published ''Under the Volcano'', while [[George Orwell]]'s satire of totalitarianism, ''1984'', was published in 1949. One of the most influential novels of the immediate post-war period was [[William Cooper (novelist)|William Cooper]]'s (1910\u20132002) naturalistic ''Scenes from Provincial Life'' (1950), which was a conscious rejection of the modernist tradition.<ref>Bradbury, Malcolm. \"Introduction to ''Scenes from Provincial Life''.

Her works including ''[[Under the Net]]'' (1954), ''The Black Prince'' (1973) and ''The Green Knight'' (1993). Scottish writer [[Muriel Spark]]'s also began publishing in the 1950s. She pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels. Her first, ''[[The Comforters]]'' (1957), concerns a woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel; ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' (1961), at times takes the reader briefly into the distant future to see the various fates that befall its characters. [[Anthony Burgess]] is especially remembered for his [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]] ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of [[Gothic fantasy]] [[Mervyn Peake]] (1911\u201368) published his highly successful [[Gormenghast trilogy]] between 1946 and 1959.\n\nImmigrant authors played a major role in post-war literature. [[Doris Lessing]] (1919) from [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), published her first novel ''The Grass is Singing'' in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the Nobel prize for literature in 2007. [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947) is another among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' 1981, which was awarded both the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and [[Booker prize]], and named [[The Best of the Booker|Booker of Bookers]] in 1993. His most controversial novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1989), was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. [[V. S. Naipaul]] (born 1932), born in [[Trinidad]], was another immigrant, who wrote among other things ''A House for Mr Biswas'' (1961) and ''[[A Bend in the River]]'' (1979).

Australia is vulnerable to the [[effects of global warming]] projected for the next 50 to 100 years because of its extensive arid and semi-arid areas, an already warm climate, high annual rainfall variability, and existing pressures on water supply. The continent's high fire risk increases this susceptibility to change in temperature and climate. Additionally, Australia's population is highly concentrated in coastal areas, and its important tourism industry depends on the health of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and other fragile ecosystems. The impacts of climate change in Australia will be complex and to some degree uncertain, but increased foresight may enable the country to safeguard its future through planned [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]]. Mitigation may reduce the ultimate extent of climate change and its impacts, but requires global solutions and cooperation, while adaptation can be performed at national and local levels.<ref>{{cite book |title=Climate Change: An Australian Guide to the Science and Potential Impacts |editor-first=Barrie |editor-last=Pittock |publisher=[[Australian Greenhouse Office]] |location=Commonwealth of Australia |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-920840-12-9 |url=http://www.ccma.vic.gov.au/soilhealth/climate_change_literature_review/documents/organisations/ago/science-guide.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Pre-instrumental climate change ==\n[[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatic]] records indicate that during glacial maxima Australia was extremely arid,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/new_australasia.html|title=Australasia}}</ref> with plant [[pollen]] fossils showing deserts as far as northern Tasmania and a vast area of less than 12% vegetation cover over all of [[South Australia]] and adjacent regions of other states. Forest cover was largely limited to sheltered areas of the east coast and the extreme southwest of Western Australia.\n\nDuring these glacial maxima the climate was also much colder and windier than today.<ref>[[Tim Flannery|Flannery, Tim]], ''The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People''; p. 115 {{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}}</ref> Minimum temperatures in winter in the centre of the continent were as much as 9&nbsp;\u00b0C (16&nbsp;\u00b0F) lower than they are today. Hydrological evidence for dryness during glacial maxima can also be seen at major lakes in Victoria's Western District, which dried up between around 20,000 and 15,000 years ago and re-filled from around 12,000 years ago.<ref>Water Research Foundation of Australia; ''1975 symposium: the 1973-4 floods in rural and urban communities''; seminar held in August 1976 by the Victorian Branch of the Water Research Foundation of Australia.</ref>\n\nDuring the early [[Holocene]], there is evidence from [[Lake Frome]] in South Australia and Lake Woods near [[Tennant Creek]] that the climate between 8,000 and 9,500 years ago and again from 7,000 to 4,200 years ago was considerably wetter than over the period of instrumental recording since about 1885.<ref>Allen, R. J.; ''The Australasian Summer Monsoon, Teleconnections, and Flooding in the Lake Eyre Basin''; pp. 41\u201342. {{ISBN|0-909112-09-6}}</ref> The research that gave these records also suggested that the rainfall flooding Frome was certainly [[Monsoon|summer-dominant rainfall]] because of pollen counts from grass species.

The onset of modern conditions with periodic wet season failure is dated at around 4,000 years before the present.\n\nIn southern Victoria, there is evidence for generally wet conditions except for a much drier spell between about 3,000 and 2,100 years before the present,<ref>Water Research Foundation of Australia; ''1975 symposium''</ref> when it is believed [[Lake Corangamite]] fell to levels well below those observed between European settlement and the 1990s. After this dry period, Western District lakes returned to their previous levels fairly quickly and by 1800 they were at their highest levels in the forty thousand years of record available.\n\nElsewhere, data for most of the Holocene are deficient, largely because methods used elsewhere to determine past climates (like tree-ring data) cannot be used in Australia owing to the character of its soils and climate. Recently, however, [[coral]] cores have been used to examine rainfall over those areas of [[Queensland]] draining into the [[Great Barrier Reef]].<ref>Lough, J. M.

These suggest that, for the period beginning with [http://www.koalanet.com.au/european-settlement.html the first European settlement], the first thirty-five years or so were wet and were followed by a much drier period up to the mid-1860s,<ref>Warner, R.

Rain gauges were gradually installed at other major centres across the continent, with the present gauges in Melbourne and Sydney dating from 1858 and 1859 respectively.\n\nIn eastern Australia, where the continent's first large-scale agriculture began, a large number of rain gauges were installed during the 1860s and by 1875 a comprehensive network had been developed in the \"settled\" areas of that state.<ref>Green, H.J.; ''Results of rainfall observations made in South Australia and the Northern Territory: including all available annual rainfall totals from 829 stations for all years of recording up to 1917, with maps and diagrams: also appendices, presenting monthly and yearly meteorological elements for Adelaide and Darwin''; published 1918 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology</ref> With the spread of the [[Pastoral farming|pastoral industry]] to the north of the continent during this period, [[rain gauge]]s were established extensively in newly settled areas, reaching [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] by 1869, [[Alice Springs]] by 1874, and the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]], [[Channel Country]] and [[Gulf Savannah]] by 1880.\n\nBy 1885,<ref>Gibbs, W.J. and Maher, J. V.; ''Rainfall deciles as drought indicators''; published 1967 by Australian Bureau of Meteorology</ref> most of Australia had a network of rainfall reporting stations adequate to give a good picture of climatic variability over the continent. The exceptions were remote areas of western Tasmania, the ''extreme'' southwest of Western Australia, [[Cape York Peninsula]],<ref>Hunt, H.A. ''Results of rainfall observations made in Queensland: including all available annual rainfall totals from 1040 stations for all years of record up to 1913, together with maps and diagrams''; published 1914 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology</ref> the northern Kimberley and the deserts of northwestern South Australia and southeastern Western Australia. In these areas good-quality climatic data were not available for quite some time after that.\n\nTemperature measurements, although made at major population centres from days of the earliest rain gauges, were generally not established when rain gauges spread to more remote locations during the 1870s and 1880s. Although they gradually caught up in number with rain gauges, many places which have had rainfall data for over 125 years have only a few decades of temperature records.\n\n=== Climate history based on instrumental records ===\nAustralia's instrumental record from 1885 to the present shows the following broad picture:\n\nConditions from 1885 to 1898 were generally fairly wet, though less so than in the period since 1968.

Two major [[El Ni\u00f1o]] events in 1902 and 1905 produced the two driest years across the whole continent, whilst 1919 was similarly dry in the eastern States apart from the Gippsland.\n\nThe period from 1922 to 1938 was ''[[Drought in Australia#Drought in the 20th century|exceptionally dry]]'', with only 1930 having Australia-wide rainfall above the long-term mean and the Australia-wide average rainfall for these seventeen years being 15 to 20 per cent below that for other periods since 1885. This dry period is attributed in some sources to a weakening of the Southern Oscillation<ref>Allan, R.J.; Lindesay, J. and Parker, D.E.; ''El Ni\u00f1o, Southern Oscillation and Climate Variability''; p. 70. {{ISBN|0-643-05803-6}}</ref> and in others to reduced sea surface temperatures.<ref>[http://www.clw.csiro.au/publications/technical99/tr22-99.pdf Soils and landscapes near Narrabri and Edgeroi, NSW, with data analysis using fuzzy k-means]</ref> Temperatures in these three periods were generally cooler than they are currently, with 1925 having the coolest minima of any year since 1910. However, the dry years of the 1920s and 1930s were also often quite warm, with 1928 and 1938 having particularly high maxima.\n\nThe period from 1939 to 1967 began with an increase in rainfall: 1939, 1941 and 1942 were the first close-together group of relatively wet years since 1921. From 1943 to 1946, generally dry conditions returned, and the two decades from 1947 saw fluctuating rainfall. 1950, 1955 and 1956 were exceptionally wet except 1950 and 1956 over arid and wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. 1950 saw [[1950 Australian rainfall records|extraordinary rains]] in central [[New South Wales]] and most of [[Queensland]]: [[Dubbo]]'s 1950 rainfall of 1,329&nbsp;mm (52&nbsp;inches) can be estimated to have a [[return period]] of ''between 350 and 400 years'', whilst [[Lake Eyre]] filled for the first time in thirty years. In contrast, 1951, 1961 and 1965 were very dry, with complete monsoon failure in 1951/1952 and extreme drought in the interior during 1961 and 1965. Temperatures over this period initially fell to their lowest levels of the 20th century, with 1949 and 1956 being particularly cool, but then began a rising trend that has continued with few interruptions to the present.\n\nSince 1968, Australia's rainfall has been 15 per cent higher than between 1885 and 1967. The wettest periods have been from 1973 to 1975 and 1998 to 2001, which comprise ''seven of the thirteen wettest years'' over the continent since 1885. Overnight minimum temperatures, especially in winter, have been markedly higher than before the 1960s, with 1973, 1980, 1988, 1991, 1998 and 2005 outstanding in this respect.

In addition, the MCG would be located precariously close to the wider Yarra River and be subject to flooding. Such a rise would displace roughly 200,000 people in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula, excluding Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula.\n\n====Transportation====\nA sea level rise of 1&nbsp;m would affect roadways near the coast and pose a threat to the Stony Point rail line and West Melbourne dock and cargo lines and yards.

The ERF, and other policies, will need further funding to achieve our climate targets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BriefingBook45p/EmissionsReduction|title=Climate change\u2014reducing Australia\u2019s emissions|last=Hanna|first=Emily|website=Parliament of Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Morrison Government]], Australia experienced some criticism as it plans to use a carbon accounting [[loophole]] from the expiring Kyoto Protocol agreement to fulfill its (already modest) Paris commitments. According to Climate Analytics, Australia pledged in Paris to cut its emissions between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 but it is currently on track for a 7% cut.<ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/as-fires-rage-australia-pushes-to-emit-more-carbon/ As Fires Rage, Australia Pushes to Emit More Carbon]</ref>\n\n==== State ====\n\n===== Victoria =====\n[[File:Victorian_Central_Highlands_log_dump_03_Pengo.jpg|thumb|A protest on [[World Environment Day]] in Victoria]]\nThe state of Victoria, in particular, has been proactive in pursuing reductions in GHG through a range of initiatives. In 1989 it produced the first state climate change strategy, \"The Greenhouse Challenge\". Other states have also taken a more proactive stance than the federal government. One such initiative undertaken by the Victorian Government is the 2002 Greenhouse Challenge for Energy Policy package, which aims to reduce Victorian emissions through a mandated renewable energy target. Initially, it aimed to have a 10 per cent share of Victoria's energy consumption being produced by renewable technologies by 2010, with 1000 MW of wind power under construction by 2006. The government legislated to ensure that by 2016 electricity retailers in Victoria purchase 10 per cent of their energy from renewables. This was ultimately overtaken by the national Renewable Energy Target (RET). By providing a market incentive for the development of renewables, the government helps foster the development of the renewable energy sector. A Green Paper and White Paper on Climate Change was produced in 2010, including funding for a number of programs. A Climate Change Act was passed including targets for 50% reduction in emissions. A recent review of this Act has recommended further changes.\n\nThe supreme court of Australia stopped a logging project in Victoria because it will be particularly destructive after the bushfires. The premier of Victoria [[Daniel Andrews]] announced that by 2030 [[logging]] in the state will be banned.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davidson |first1=Jordan |title=Australian Supreme Court Halts Logging Project as Animals Seek New Habitat Amid Fire Destruction |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/fire-in-australia-court-stops-logging-2644976905.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |agency=Ecowatch |date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===== South Australia =====\nFormer Premier [[Mike Rann]] (2002\u20132011) was Australia's first Climate Change Minister and passed legislation committing South Australia to renewable energy and emissions reduction targets.  Announced in March 2006, this was the first legislation passed anywhere in Australia committed to cutting emissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationsa.org.au/media-releases/293-ranns-climate-change-laws-a-first-for-australia.html|title=Rann's climate change laws a first for Australia|date=3 March 2006|work=Conservation Council of South Australia|access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref> By the end of 2011, 26% of South Australia's electricity generation derived from wind power, edging out coal-fired power for the first time. Although only 7.2% of Australia's population live in South Australia, in 2011, it had 54% of Australia's installed wind capacity. Following the introduction of solar feed-in tariff legislation South Australia also had the highest per-capita take up of household rooftop photo-voltaic installations in Australia. In an educative program, the Rann government invested in installing rooftop solar arrays on the major public buildings including the Parliament, Museum, Adelaide Airport, Adelaide Showgrounds pavilion and public schools. About 31% of South Australia's total power is derived from renewables. In the five years to the end of 2011, South Australia experienced a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong employment and economic growth during this period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnponline.org/ht/d/ViewBloggerThread/i/37261|title=What States Can Do \u2013 Part I: Climate Change Policy|last=Rann|first=Mike|date=4 April 2012|work=The Center for National Policy|access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Solar art prize|Solar Art Prize]] was created by Pip Fletcher, and has run annually since, inviting artists from South Australia to reflect subjects of climate change and environmentalism in their work. Some winning artists receive renewable energy service prizes which can be redeemed as solar panels, solar hot water or battery storage systems.\n\n===== Western Australia =====\nOn 6 May 2007, the Premier of Western Australia, Alan Carpenter announced the formation of a new Climate Change Office responsible to a Minister, with a plan that included:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.environment.wa.gov.au/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DOE_ADMIN/GREENHOUSE_REPOSITORY/TAB6327544/2007006CLIMATECHANGE.PDF|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028185009/http://portal.environment.wa.gov.au/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DOE_ADMIN/GREENHOUSE_REPOSITORY/TAB6327544/2007006CLIMATECHANGE.PDF|archive-date=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=11 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n* a target to reduce emissions by at least 60% below 2000 levels by 2050\n* a $36.5 million Low Emission Energy Development Fund\n* a target to increase renewable energy generation on the [[South West Interconnected System]] to 15% by 2020 and 20% by 2025\n* a clean energy target of 50% by 2010 and 60% by 2020\n* State Government purchase of 20% renewable energy by 2010\n* a mandatory energy efficiency program that will require large and medium energy users to invest in cost effective energy efficiency measures\n* tripling the successful solar schools program so that over 350 schools will be using renewable energy by 2010\n* a new $1.5 million Household Sustainability Audit and Education program that will provide practical information to households about how they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n* investing 8.625 million to help businesses and communities adapt to the impacts of climate change\n* the development of new climate change legislation\n* a commitment to establishment of a national emissions trading scheme\n\nThis plan has been criticised by Greens MP Paul Llewellyn who stated that short-term programmatic targets rather than aspirational targets to greenhouse gas emissions were needed, and that renewable energy growth in the state was still being driven entirely by federal government policy and incentives, not by measures being made by the state government.\n\n=== Youth Climate Movement ===\n{{Main|Youth Climate Movement}}\n{{See also|Australian Youth Climate Coalition}}\n\n==== Australian Student Environment Network ====\n[[Australian Student Environment Network]] (ASEN) is a non-profit, grassroots network of student activists from universities, TAFEs and secondary schools across Australia. The network aims to create a generation of change-agents actively working to achieve environmental and social justice within the Australian and world context. The network has a strong focus on equipping young people with organising and facilitation skills and provides first-hand campaigning experience in environmental advocacy and grassroots organising. Annually, the ASEN summer training camp brings together students for one week of facilitated skill sharing, workshopping, campaign planning and strategising.\n\nASEN has multiple campaign foci including climate change, coal mining, green jobs, campus sustainability (energy/emissions & recycled paper), nuclear power, Gold and Uranium mining and the genocide of Indigenous peoples. In addition, the network builds and lives-out alternative ideas and lifestyles through community projects such as co-operatives (food, housing and transport), on-campus permaculture gardens and by investing in community supported agriculture.\n\n=== Campaigns and events ===\n\n==== Youth ====\n\n* Adopt a Politician\n\nThe AYCC supports numerous projects by harnessing the knowledge, skills and experience of its coalition member groups. In August 2007, the AYCC launched their federal election campaign \"Adopt a Politician\" providing young voters and non-voters a platform on which to engage with their local community on the issue and pressure their federal candidates to save their future by committing to better policies.\n\n* Switched On\n\nIn October 2007, the AYCC and ASEN organised the largest gathering of young climate activists from around the country at the conference \"Switched On\" in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. The conferenced aimed to facilitate critical thinking on climate change and its solutions, share knowledge and skills for organising around climate change and provide support and networking opportunities for the growing youth climate movement in Australia.\n\n* Kyoto\n\nIn November 2007, youth delegates from the AYCC attended the Kyoto negotiations in Bali where they collaborated with other national youth networks and young climate activists from around the world.\n\n* Community awareness\n\nSYCAN-the Sydney Youth Climate Action Network was founded at OzGreen's Youth Leading Australia Congress in 2009. SYCAN is working in local communities to reduce emissions through education and practical solutions. SYCAN is a non-profit, non-partisan group of youth volunteers. SYCAN as of January 2011 currently has two branches (Northern Beaches and Inner-West areas).\n\n==== Non-youth ====\n[[File:Climate_Rally_flows_down_Swanston_street.jpg|thumb|Walk against warming in Melbourne, December 2009]]\n\n* '''Walk Against Warming''': annual community event supported by several NGOs and Australian Conservation Councils.

In late 2006, Queensland Conservation lodged an objection to the greenhouse gas emissions from a large coal mine expansion proposed by Xstrata Coal Queensland Pty Ltd. QC's action aimed to have the true costs of the greenhouse gas emissions from coal mining recognised. The Newlands Coal Mine Expansion will produce 28.5&nbsp;million tonnes of coal over its fifteen years of operation. The mining, transport and use of this coal will emit 84 million tonnes of C02 into the atmosphere. Queensland Conservation aims to have reasonable and practical measures imposed on new mines to avoid, reduce or offset the emissions from the mining, transport and use of their coal. The Land and Resources Tribunal ruled against the case.<ref>Kathryn Roberts (16 February 2007)[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s1849776.htm Mining giant wins global warming court case]/ World Today.

Australia is vulnerable to the [[effects of global warming]] projected for the next 50 to 100 years because of its extensive arid and semi-arid areas, an already warm climate, high annual rainfall variability, and existing pressures on water supply. The continent's high fire risk increases this susceptibility to change in temperature and climate. Additionally, Australia's population is highly concentrated in coastal areas, and its important tourism industry depends on the health of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and other fragile ecosystems. The impacts of climate change in Australia will be complex and to some degree uncertain, but increased foresight may enable the country to safeguard its future through planned [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]]. Mitigation may reduce the ultimate extent of climate change and its impacts, but requires global solutions and cooperation, while adaptation can be performed at national and local levels.<ref>{{cite book |title=Climate Change: An Australian Guide to the Science and Potential Impacts |editor-first=Barrie |editor-last=Pittock |publisher=[[Australian Greenhouse Office]] |location=Commonwealth of Australia |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-920840-12-9 |url=http://www.ccma.vic.gov.au/soilhealth/climate_change_literature_review/documents/organisations/ago/science-guide.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Pre-instrumental climate change ==\n[[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatic]] records indicate that during glacial maxima Australia was extremely arid,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/new_australasia.html|title=Australasia}}</ref> with plant [[pollen]] fossils showing deserts as far as northern Tasmania and a vast area of less than 12% vegetation cover over all of [[South Australia]] and adjacent regions of other states. Forest cover was largely limited to sheltered areas of the east coast and the extreme southwest of Western Australia.\n\nDuring these glacial maxima the climate was also much colder and windier than today.<ref>[[Tim Flannery|Flannery, Tim]], ''The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People''; p. 115 {{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}}</ref> Minimum temperatures in winter in the centre of the continent were as much as 9&nbsp;\u00b0C (16&nbsp;\u00b0F) lower than they are today. Hydrological evidence for dryness during glacial maxima can also be seen at major lakes in Victoria's Western District, which dried up between around 20,000 and 15,000 years ago and re-filled from around 12,000 years ago.<ref>Water Research Foundation of Australia; ''1975 symposium: the 1973-4 floods in rural and urban communities''; seminar held in August 1976 by the Victorian Branch of the Water Research Foundation of Australia.</ref>\n\nDuring the early [[Holocene]], there is evidence from [[Lake Frome]] in South Australia and Lake Woods near [[Tennant Creek]] that the climate between 8,000 and 9,500 years ago and again from 7,000 to 4,200 years ago was considerably wetter than over the period of instrumental recording since about 1885.<ref>Allen, R. J.; ''The Australasian Summer Monsoon, Teleconnections, and Flooding in the Lake Eyre Basin''; pp. 41\u201342. {{ISBN|0-909112-09-6}}</ref> The research that gave these records also suggested that the rainfall flooding Frome was certainly [[Monsoon|summer-dominant rainfall]] because of pollen counts from grass species.

The onset of modern conditions with periodic wet season failure is dated at around 4,000 years before the present.\n\nIn southern Victoria, there is evidence for generally wet conditions except for a much drier spell between about 3,000 and 2,100 years before the present,<ref>Water Research Foundation of Australia; ''1975 symposium''</ref> when it is believed [[Lake Corangamite]] fell to levels well below those observed between European settlement and the 1990s. After this dry period, Western District lakes returned to their previous levels fairly quickly and by 1800 they were at their highest levels in the forty thousand years of record available.\n\nElsewhere, data for most of the Holocene are deficient, largely because methods used elsewhere to determine past climates (like tree-ring data) cannot be used in Australia owing to the character of its soils and climate. Recently, however, [[coral]] cores have been used to examine rainfall over those areas of [[Queensland]] draining into the [[Great Barrier Reef]].<ref>Lough, J. M.

These suggest that, for the period beginning with [http://www.koalanet.com.au/european-settlement.html the first European settlement], the first thirty-five years or so were wet and were followed by a much drier period up to the mid-1860s,<ref>Warner, R.

No. 168; pp. 327\u2013338, 1987.</ref> when usable instrumental records started.\n\n== Instrumental climate records ==\n\n=== Development of an instrumental network ===\nAlthough [[rain gauge]]s were installed privately by some of the earliest settlers, the first [[Instrumental temperature record|instrumental climate records]] in Australia were not compiled until 1840 at [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales|Port Macquarie]]. Rain gauges were gradually installed at other major centres across the continent, with the present gauges in Melbourne and Sydney dating from 1858 and 1859 respectively.\n\nIn eastern Australia, where the continent's first large-scale agriculture began, a large number of rain gauges were installed during the 1860s and by 1875 a comprehensive network had been developed in the \"settled\" areas of that state.<ref>Green, H.J.; ''Results of rainfall observations made in South Australia and the Northern Territory: including all available annual rainfall totals from 829 stations for all years of recording up to 1917, with maps and diagrams: also appendices, presenting monthly and yearly meteorological elements for Adelaide and Darwin''; published 1918 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology</ref> With the spread of the [[Pastoral farming|pastoral industry]] to the north of the continent during this period, [[rain gauge]]s were established extensively in newly settled areas, reaching [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] by 1869, [[Alice Springs]] by 1874, and the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]], [[Channel Country]] and [[Gulf Savannah]] by 1880.\n\nBy 1885,<ref>Gibbs, W.J. and Maher, J. V.; ''Rainfall deciles as drought indicators''; published 1967 by Australian Bureau of Meteorology</ref> most of Australia had a network of rainfall reporting stations adequate to give a good picture of climatic variability over the continent. The exceptions were remote areas of western Tasmania, the ''extreme'' southwest of Western Australia, [[Cape York Peninsula]],<ref>Hunt, H.A. ''Results of rainfall observations made in Queensland: including all available annual rainfall totals from 1040 stations for all years of record up to 1913, together with maps and diagrams''; published 1914 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology</ref> the northern Kimberley and the deserts of northwestern South Australia and southeastern Western Australia. In these areas good-quality climatic data were not available for quite some time after that.\n\nTemperature measurements, although made at major population centres from days of the earliest rain gauges, were generally not established when rain gauges spread to more remote locations during the 1870s and 1880s. Although they gradually caught up in number with rain gauges, many places which have had rainfall data for over 125 years have only a few decades of temperature records.\n\n=== Climate history based on instrumental records ===\nAustralia's instrumental record from 1885 to the present shows the following broad picture:\n\nConditions from 1885 to 1898 were generally fairly wet, though less so than in the period since 1968. The only noticeably dry years in this era were 1888 and 1897.

Two major [[El Ni\u00f1o]] events in 1902 and 1905 produced the two driest years across the whole continent, whilst 1919 was similarly dry in the eastern States apart from the Gippsland.\n\nThe period from 1922 to 1938 was ''[[Drought in Australia#Drought in the 20th century|exceptionally dry]]'', with only 1930 having Australia-wide rainfall above the long-term mean and the Australia-wide average rainfall for these seventeen years being 15 to 20 per cent below that for other periods since 1885.

However, the dry years of the 1920s and 1930s were also often quite warm, with 1928 and 1938 having particularly high maxima.\n\nThe period from 1939 to 1967 began with an increase in rainfall: 1939, 1941 and 1942 were the first close-together group of relatively wet years since 1921. From 1943 to 1946, generally dry conditions returned, and the two decades from 1947 saw fluctuating rainfall. 1950, 1955 and 1956 were exceptionally wet except 1950 and 1956 over arid and wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. 1950 saw [[1950 Australian rainfall records|extraordinary rains]] in central [[New South Wales]] and most of [[Queensland]]: [[Dubbo]]'s 1950 rainfall of 1,329&nbsp;mm (52&nbsp;inches) can be estimated to have a [[return period]] of ''between 350 and 400 years'', whilst [[Lake Eyre]] filled for the first time in thirty years. In contrast, 1951, 1961 and 1965 were very dry, with complete monsoon failure in 1951/1952 and extreme drought in the interior during 1961 and 1965. Temperatures over this period initially fell to their lowest levels of the 20th century, with 1949 and 1956 being particularly cool, but then began a rising trend that has continued with few interruptions to the present.\n\nSince 1968, Australia's rainfall has been 15 per cent higher than between 1885 and 1967. The wettest periods have been from 1973 to 1975 and 1998 to 2001, which comprise ''seven of the thirteen wettest years'' over the continent since 1885. Overnight minimum temperatures, especially in winter, have been markedly higher than before the 1960s, with 1973, 1980, 1988, 1991, 1998 and 2005 outstanding in this respect.

There was a slight increase in rainfall from 1916 to 1934 and then a decline to 1901\u20131910 levels from 1936 to 1948, before a return to the pre-1900 \"flood-dominated\" climate regime occurred in 1949.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n* In northwestern Australia, rainfall was moderate from 1885 to about 1925, then declined from the late 1920s to the late 1960s (with very dry conditions during the 1950s), followed by rapid increases since then. In Darwin, six of the seven wettest wet seasons have occurred since 1995, and the major droughts that once affected the region frequently have virtually disappeared since 1971.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n== Current effects of climate change on Australia ==\n[[File:ClimateSummitParliament.jpg|thumb|Protesters from the Climate Action Summit outside of [[Parliament House, Canberra]]]]\nAccording to the [[CSIRO]] and [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]], climate change is expected to have numerous adverse effects on many species, regions, activities and much infrastructure and areas of the economy and public health in Australia.

In addition, the MCG would be located precariously close to the wider Yarra River and be subject to flooding. Such a rise would displace roughly 200,000 people in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula, excluding Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula.\n\n====Transportation====\nA sea level rise of 1&nbsp;m would affect roadways near the coast and pose a threat to the Stony Point rail line and West Melbourne dock and cargo lines and yards.

In 1989 it produced the first state climate change strategy, \"The Greenhouse Challenge\". Other states have also taken a more proactive stance than the federal government. One such initiative undertaken by the Victorian Government is the 2002 Greenhouse Challenge for Energy Policy package, which aims to reduce Victorian emissions through a mandated renewable energy target. Initially, it aimed to have a 10 per cent share of Victoria's energy consumption being produced by renewable technologies by 2010, with 1000 MW of wind power under construction by 2006. The government legislated to ensure that by 2016 electricity retailers in Victoria purchase 10 per cent of their energy from renewables. This was ultimately overtaken by the national Renewable Energy Target (RET). By providing a market incentive for the development of renewables, the government helps foster the development of the renewable energy sector. A Green Paper and White Paper on Climate Change was produced in 2010, including funding for a number of programs. A Climate Change Act was passed including targets for 50% reduction in emissions. A recent review of this Act has recommended further changes.\n\nThe supreme court of Australia stopped a logging project in Victoria because it will be particularly destructive after the bushfires. The premier of Victoria [[Daniel Andrews]] announced that by 2030 [[logging]] in the state will be banned.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davidson |first1=Jordan |title=Australian Supreme Court Halts Logging Project as Animals Seek New Habitat Amid Fire Destruction |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/fire-in-australia-court-stops-logging-2644976905.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |agency=Ecowatch |date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===== South Australia =====\nFormer Premier [[Mike Rann]] (2002\u20132011) was Australia's first Climate Change Minister and passed legislation committing South Australia to renewable energy and emissions reduction targets.

Although only 7.2% of Australia's population live in South Australia, in 2011, it had 54% of Australia's installed wind capacity. Following the introduction of solar feed-in tariff legislation South Australia also had the highest per-capita take up of household rooftop photo-voltaic installations in Australia. In an educative program, the Rann government invested in installing rooftop solar arrays on the major public buildings including the Parliament, Museum, Adelaide Airport, Adelaide Showgrounds pavilion and public schools. About 31% of South Australia's total power is derived from renewables. In the five years to the end of 2011, South Australia experienced a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong employment and economic growth during this period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnponline.org/ht/d/ViewBloggerThread/i/37261|title=What States Can Do \u2013 Part I: Climate Change Policy|last=Rann|first=Mike|date=4 April 2012|work=The Center for National Policy|access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Solar art prize|Solar Art Prize]] was created by Pip Fletcher, and has run annually since, inviting artists from South Australia to reflect subjects of climate change and environmentalism in their work.

They shared this style with only five other monarchs in [[Europe]]: the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the Kings of [[France]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Aragon]] and [[Portugal]]. Around 1519, however, the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of France assumed the style \"Majesty\"; [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] copied them. The style \"Majesty\" had previously appeared in England, but did not become common until Henry VIII's reign.\n\n\"Majesty\", however, was not used exclusively; it arbitrarily alternated with both \"Highness\" and \"Grace\", even in official documents. For example, one legal judgment issued by Henry VIII uses all three indiscriminately; Article 15 begins with \"the Kinges Highness hath ordered\", Article 16 with \"the Kinges Majestie\" and Article 17 with \"the Kinges Grace\".\n\nScottish sovereigns were addressed as \"Your Grace\", rather than \"Majesty\", in pre-Union Scotland. During the reign of [[James I of England|James VI of Scots and I of England and Ireland]], however, \"Majesty\" became the official title, to the exclusion of others.\n\nIn full the sovereign is referred to as \"[[Most Gracious Majesty|His [Her] Most Gracious Majesty]]\". In [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] the phrase \"[[Most Excellent Majesty|The King's [Queen's] Most Excellent Majesty]]\" is used in the [[List of enacting formulae|enacting clause]]. In [[treaties]] and on [[British passport]]s, the sovereign is referred to as \"[[Britannic Majesty|His [Her] Britannic Majesty]]\" as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns.\n\n==Style of the sovereign==\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon kings]] of [[England]] used numerous different styles, including \"King of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]\" and \"King of the English\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=H. Munro |authorlink=Hector Munro Chadwick|title=The Origin of the English Nation|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.264231|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=1924|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.264231/page/n64 54]}}</ref> Grander variations were adopted by some monarchs; for example, [[Edred of England|Edred]] used \"King of the Anglo-Saxons, [[Northumbria]]ns, [[Danelaw|pagans]] and [[Cornwall|Britons]]\". These styles were sometimes accompanied by extravagant epithets; for instance, [[Athelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]] was \"King of the English, raised by the right hand of the Almighty to the Throne of the whole Kingdom of Britain\".\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign saw the use of five different royal styles.]]\n\nIn Scotland the preferred title of the monarch was \"King/Queen of Scots\" rather than \"of Scotland\" (although the latter was by no means unknown).\n\n[[William I of England|William I]], the first Norman monarch of England, used the simple \"King of the English\". His successor, [[William II of England|William II]], was the first consistently to use \"by the Grace of God\". [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] added \"[[Duke of Normandy|Duke of the Normans]]\" in 1121, though he had seized [[Normandy]] from his brother [[Robert Curthose|Robert]] in 1106. In 1152 [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] acquired many further French possessions through his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]; soon thereafter, he added \"[[Duke of Aquitaine|Duke of the Aquitanians]]\" and \"[[Count of Anjou|Count of the Angevins]]\" to his style.\n\n\"King of the English\", \"Duke of the Normans\", \"Duke of the Aquitanians\" and \"Count of the Angevins\" remained in use until [[John of England|King John]] ascended the Throne in 1199, when they changed to \"King of England\", \"Duke of Normandy\", \"Duke of Aquitaine\" and \"Count of Anjou\", respectively. John, furthermore, was already the titular ruler of Ireland; therefore, he added \"[[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]]\" to his style.\n\nIn 1204 England lost both Normandy and Anjou. Nevertheless, they did not renounce the associated titles until 1259. French territory once again became the subject of dispute after the death of the French King [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1328. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] claimed the French Throne, arguing that it was to pass to him through his mother [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], Charles IV's sister. In France, however, it was asserted that the Throne could not pass to or through a woman. Edward III began to use the title \"[[English claims to the French throne|King of France]]\" (dropping \"Duke of Aquitaine\") after 1337. In 1340 he entered France, where he was publicly proclaimed King. In 1360, however, he agreed to relinquish his title to the French claimant. Though he stopped using the title in legal documents, he did not formally exchange letters confirming the renunciation with the French King. In 1369 Edward III resumed the title, claiming that the French had breached their treaty.\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France, but agreed to the [[Treaty of Troyes]], whereby he was recognised as the [[Heir Apparent|Heir]] and [[Regent]] of France, in 1420. He died in 1422, to be succeeded by his infant son, who became [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. Shortly after his accession, Henry VI also inherited the French Throne. By the 1450s, however, England had lost all its territories in France, with the exception of [[Calais]]. The claim to the title of \"King of France\" was nonetheless not relinquished until the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801, by which time the French monarchy had been overthrown by the [[French Revolution]].\n\nAfter 1422 the royal style remained unchanged for almost a century. Numerous amendments, however, were effected during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign. After Henry wrote a book against the Protestant [[Martin Luther]], [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded him by granting the title \"[[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]\". After disagreements with the Papacy over his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], Henry VIII broke away from the [[Roman Catholic Church]], establishing the [[Church of England]] in 1533. [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but Henry continued to use it. In 1535 Henry added \"of the Church of England in Earth, under Jesus Christ, Supreme Head\" to his style in 1535; a reference to the [[Church of Ireland]] was added in 1536. Meanwhile, advised that many Irish people regarded the pope as the true temporal authority in their nation, with the king of England acting as a mere representative, Henry VIII changed \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" in 1542.<ref>[[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]] ''The Rights of Persons, According to the Text of Blackstone: Incorporating the Alterations Down to the Present Time'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] and James Stewart, 1839, p.92</ref> All changes made by Henry VIII were confirmed by an English Act of Parliament passed in 1544.<ref>(35 Hen VIII c. 3) ''The Rights of Persons, According to the Text of Blackstone:Incorporating the Alterations Down to the Present Time'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] and James Stewart, 1839, p.92</ref>\n\n[[Image:Queen Victoria 1887.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Queen Victoria]] was the first British monarch to use the style \"Empress of India\".]]\n\n[[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, omitted \"of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" in 1553, replacing it with \"etc.\", but the phrase remained part of the official style until an Act of Parliament to the contrary was passed in 1555. In the meantime Mary had married the Spanish prince [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]]. The monarchs adopted a joint style, \"King and Queen of England and France, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], Archdukes of [[Archduke of Austria|Austria]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Count and Countess of [[Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]\", acknowledging both Mary's and Philip's titles. Further changes were made after Philip became King of Spain and Sicily upon his father's abdication.\n\nWhen the Protestant [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] ascended the Throne, she used the simpler \"Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\". The \"etc.\" was added in anticipation of a restoration of the supremacy phrase, which never actually occurred.\n\nAfter [[James I of England|James VI]], who was already King in [[Scotland]], ascended the English Throne, the official style changed to \"King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\"; his mother [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had already laid claim to these titles (in a different order, jointly with [[Francis II of France]], then with the King's father, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]]), but she was beheaded by her Protestant opponent, Elizabeth I. In 1604 James VI made a proclamation permitting the use of \"King of [[Great Britain]]\" instead of \"King of England and Scotland\". This new style, though commonly used to refer to the King, was never statutory; therefore, it did not appear on legal instruments. It did, however, appear on the inscriptions on [[coin]]s.\n\nThe kingdoms of England and Scotland were formally united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 by the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] consequently assumed the style \"Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\". It remained in use until 1801, when Great Britain and Ireland combined to become the United Kingdom. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] used the opportunity to drop both the reference to France and \"etc.\" from the style. It was suggested to him that he assume the title \"[[British Emperor|Emperor]]\", but he rejected the proposal. Instead, the style became \"King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith\".\n\nIn 1876 \"[[Empress of India]]\" was added to [[Queen Victoria]]'s titles by the [[Royal Titles Act 1876]], so that the Queen of the United Kingdom, the ruler of a vast empire, would not be outranked by her own [[Victoria, Princess Royal|daughter]] who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|heir to the German Empire]] (an empire by the necessity of establishing a [[federalism|federal]] monarchy in which several kings wished to retain their royal titles despite their subjugation to a different monarchy). Her successor, [[Edward VII]], changed the style to reflect the United Kingdom's other colonial possessions, adding \"and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas\" after \"Ireland\". In general usage the monarch came to be called the [[King-Emperor]], especially in the [[The Crown|Crown]]'s overseas possessions and in [[British India]] and the [[princely state]]s.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:76-834.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of King George V, marked in Latin <small>GEORGIVS V DEI GRA: BRITT: OMN: REX / FID\u00b7 DEF IND\u00b7 IMP</small> (to be read in full ''Georgius quintus, Dei grati\u00e2 Britanniarum omnium rex, fidei defensor, Indiae imperator''), in English \"George the Fifth, [[by the grace of God]], king of all the Britains, [[defender of the faith]], [[Emperor of India]]\". \"All the Britains\" was used instead of the official \"Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas\".]] -->\n\nIn 1922 the [[Irish Free State]] gained independence. In 1927 the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] changed the description \"of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas\" to \"of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas\". The 1927 Act was also significant for opening the door to [[dominion]]s (later [[Commonwealth realm]]s) having the right to determine their own style and title for the sovereign, a right which was first exercised in 1953.\n\nThe designation \"Emperor of India\" was dropped from the royal style in 1948 after the independence of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] a year earlier,<ref name=gazette1948-06-22a>{{London Gazette |issue=38330 |date=22 June 1948 |page=3647 }} Royal Proclamation of 22 June 1948, made in accordance with the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1947/30/pdfs/ukpga_19470030_en.pdf Indian Independence Act 1947, 10 & 11 GEO. 6. CH. 30.]('Section 7: ...(2)The assent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is hereby given to the omission from the Royal Style and Titles of the words \" Indiae Imperator \" and the words \" Emperor of India \" and to the issue by His Majesty for that purpose of His Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of the Realm.'). According to this Royal Proclamation, the King retained the Style and Titles 'George VI by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith', and he thus remained King of the various Dominions, including India and Pakistan, though these two (and others) eventually chose to abandon their monarchies and became republics.</ref> even though King George VI remained king of the [[dominion of India]] until 1950, when it became a republic within the Commonwealth. The [[dominion of Pakistan]] existed between 1947 and 1956, when it too became a republic within the Commonwealth. Similarly, although the [[republic of Ireland]] was constituted in 1949, \"Great Britain and Ireland\" was not replaced with \"Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" until 1953. In the same year the phrase \"[[Head of the Commonwealth]]\" was also added, and \"British Dominions beyond the Seas\" was replaced with \"other Realms and Territories\". Thus, the style of the present sovereign is \"By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".\n\nAlso in 1953, separate styles were adopted for each of the realms over which the sovereign reigned. Most realms used the form, \"Queen of ... and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth\", omitting the title \"Defender of the Faith\". [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]] all included a reference to the United Kingdom as well as \"Defender of the Faith\", but only Canada still uses this form. (Australia dropped both the reference to the United Kingdom and \"Defender of the Faith\" in 1973; New Zealand dropped the former in 1974.) Grenada's style also includes reference to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". Curiously, the style used in Pakistan made mention of the United Kingdom, but not of Pakistan, perhaps because the nation was a Dominion only in the interim, whilst a [[republic]]an constitution was being prepared.

information|Grace (style)|Highness}}\n\nFrom about the 12th century onwards, English sovereigns used the style \"Highness\". They shared this style with only five other monarchs in [[Europe]]: the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the Kings of [[France]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Aragon]] and [[Portugal]]. Around 1519, however, the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of France assumed the style \"Majesty\"; [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] copied them. The style \"Majesty\" had previously appeared in England, but did not become common until Henry VIII's reign.\n\n\"Majesty\", however, was not used exclusively; it arbitrarily alternated with both \"Highness\" and \"Grace\", even in official documents. For example, one legal judgment issued by Henry VIII uses all three indiscriminately; Article 15 begins with \"the Kinges Highness hath ordered\", Article 16 with \"the Kinges Majestie\" and Article 17 with \"the Kinges Grace\".\n\nScottish sovereigns were addressed as \"Your Grace\", rather than \"Majesty\", in pre-Union Scotland. During the reign of [[James I of England|James VI of Scots and I of England and Ireland]], however, \"Majesty\" became the official title, to the exclusion of others.\n\nIn full the sovereign is referred to as \"[[Most Gracious Majesty|His [Her] Most Gracious Majesty]]\". In [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] the phrase \"[[Most Excellent Majesty|The King's [Queen's] Most Excellent Majesty]]\" is used in the [[List of enacting formulae|enacting clause]]. In [[treaties]] and on [[British passport]]s, the sovereign is referred to as \"[[Britannic Majesty|His [Her] Britannic Majesty]]\" as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns.\n\n==Style of the sovereign==\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon kings]] of [[England]] used numerous different styles, including \"King of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]\" and \"King of the English\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=H. Munro |authorlink=Hector Munro Chadwick|title=The Origin of the English Nation|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.264231|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=1924|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.264231/page/n64 54]}}</ref> Grander variations were adopted by some monarchs; for example, [[Edred of England|Edred]] used \"King of the Anglo-Saxons, [[Northumbria]]ns, [[Danelaw|pagans]] and [[Cornwall|Britons]]\". These styles were sometimes accompanied by extravagant epithets; for instance, [[Athelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]] was \"King of the English, raised by the right hand of the Almighty to the Throne of the whole Kingdom of Britain\".\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign saw the use of five different royal styles.]]\n\nIn Scotland the preferred title of the monarch was \"King/Queen of Scots\" rather than \"of Scotland\" (although the latter was by no means unknown).\n\n[[William I of England|William I]], the first Norman monarch of England, used the simple \"King of the English\". His successor, [[William II of England|William II]], was the first consistently to use \"by the Grace of God\". [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] added \"[[Duke of Normandy|Duke of the Normans]]\" in 1121, though he had seized [[Normandy]] from his brother [[Robert Curthose|Robert]] in 1106. In 1152 [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] acquired many further French possessions through his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]; soon thereafter, he added \"[[Duke of Aquitaine|Duke of the Aquitanians]]\" and \"[[Count of Anjou|Count of the Angevins]]\" to his style.\n\n\"King of the English\", \"Duke of the Normans\", \"Duke of the Aquitanians\" and \"Count of the Angevins\" remained in use until [[John of England|King John]] ascended the Throne in 1199, when they changed to \"King of England\", \"Duke of Normandy\", \"Duke of Aquitaine\" and \"Count of Anjou\", respectively. John, furthermore, was already the titular ruler of Ireland; therefore, he added \"[[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]]\" to his style.\n\nIn 1204 England lost both Normandy and Anjou. Nevertheless, they did not renounce the associated titles until 1259. French territory once again became the subject of dispute after the death of the French King [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1328. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] claimed the French Throne, arguing that it was to pass to him through his mother [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], Charles IV's sister. In France, however, it was asserted that the Throne could not pass to or through a woman. Edward III began to use the title \"[[English claims to the French throne|King of France]]\" (dropping \"Duke of Aquitaine\") after 1337. In 1340 he entered France, where he was publicly proclaimed King. In 1360, however, he agreed to relinquish his title to the French claimant. Though he stopped using the title in legal documents, he did not formally exchange letters confirming the renunciation with the French King. In 1369 Edward III resumed the title, claiming that the French had breached their treaty.\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France, but agreed to the [[Treaty of Troyes]], whereby he was recognised as the [[Heir Apparent|Heir]] and [[Regent]] of France, in 1420. He died in 1422, to be succeeded by his infant son, who became [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. Shortly after his accession, Henry VI also inherited the French Throne. By the 1450s, however, England had lost all its territories in France, with the exception of [[Calais]]. The claim to the title of \"King of France\" was nonetheless not relinquished until the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801, by which time the French monarchy had been overthrown by the [[French Revolution]].\n\nAfter 1422 the royal style remained unchanged for almost a century. Numerous amendments, however, were effected during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign. After Henry wrote a book against the Protestant [[Martin Luther]], [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded him by granting the title \"[[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]\". After disagreements with the Papacy over his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], Henry VIII broke away from the [[Roman Catholic Church]], establishing the [[Church of England]] in 1533. [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but Henry continued to use it. In 1535 Henry added \"of the Church of England in Earth, under Jesus Christ, Supreme Head\" to his style in 1535; a reference to the [[Church of Ireland]] was added in 1536. Meanwhile, advised that many Irish people regarded the pope as the true temporal authority in their nation, with the king of England acting as a mere representative, Henry VIII changed \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" in 1542.<ref>[[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]] ''The Rights of Persons, According to the Text of Blackstone: Incorporating the Alterations Down to the Present Time'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] and James Stewart, 1839, p.92</ref> All changes made by Henry VIII were confirmed by an English Act of Parliament passed in 1544.<ref>(35 Hen VIII c. 3) ''The Rights of Persons, According to the Text of Blackstone:Incorporating the Alterations Down to the Present Time'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] and James Stewart, 1839, p.92</ref>\n\n[[Image:Queen Victoria 1887.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Queen Victoria]] was the first British monarch to use the style \"Empress of India\".]]\n\n[[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, omitted \"of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" in 1553, replacing it with \"etc.\", but the phrase remained part of the official style until an Act of Parliament to the contrary was passed in 1555. In the meantime Mary had married the Spanish prince [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]]. The monarchs adopted a joint style, \"King and Queen of England and France, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], Archdukes of [[Archduke of Austria|Austria]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Count and Countess of [[Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]\", acknowledging both Mary's and Philip's titles. Further changes were made after Philip became King of Spain and Sicily upon his father's abdication.\n\nWhen the Protestant [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] ascended the Throne, she used the simpler \"Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\". The \"etc.\" was added in anticipation of a restoration of the supremacy phrase, which never actually occurred.\n\nAfter [[James I of England|James VI]], who was already King in [[Scotland]], ascended the English Throne, the official style changed to \"King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\"; his mother [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had already laid claim to these titles (in a different order, jointly with [[Francis II of France]], then with the King's father, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]]), but she was beheaded by her Protestant opponent, Elizabeth I. In 1604 James VI made a proclamation permitting the use of \"King of [[Great Britain]]\" instead of \"King of England and Scotland\". This new style, though commonly used to refer to the King, was never statutory; therefore, it did not appear on legal instruments. It did, however, appear on the inscriptions on [[coin]]s.\n\nThe kingdoms of England and Scotland were formally united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 by the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] consequently assumed the style \"Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\". It remained in use until 1801, when Great Britain and Ireland combined to become the United Kingdom. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] used the opportunity to drop both the reference to France and \"etc.\" from the style. It was suggested to him that he assume the title \"[[British Emperor|Emperor]]\", but he rejected the proposal. Instead, the style became \"King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith\".\n\nIn 1876 \"[[Empress of India]]\" was added to [[Queen Victoria]]'s titles by the [[Royal Titles Act 1876]], so that the Queen of the United Kingdom, the ruler of a vast empire, would not be outranked by her own [[Victoria, Princess Royal|daughter]] who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|heir to the German Empire]] (an empire by the necessity of establishing a [[federalism|federal]] monarchy in which several kings wished to retain their royal titles despite their subjugation to a different monarchy). Her successor, [[Edward VII]], changed the style to reflect the United Kingdom's other colonial possessions, adding \"and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas\" after \"Ireland\". In general usage the monarch came to be called the [[King-Emperor]], especially in the [[The Crown|Crown]]'s overseas possessions and in [[British India]] and the [[princely state]]s.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:76-834.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of King George V, marked in Latin <small>GEORGIVS V DEI GRA: BRITT: OMN: REX / FID\u00b7 DEF IND\u00b7 IMP</small> (to be read in full ''Georgius quintus, Dei grati\u00e2 Britanniarum omnium rex, fidei defensor, Indiae imperator''), in English \"George the Fifth, [[by the grace of God]], king of all the Britains, [[defender of the faith]], [[Emperor of India]]\". \"All the Britains\" was used instead of the official \"Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas\".]] -->\n\nIn 1922 the [[Irish Free State]] gained independence. In 1927 the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] changed the description \"of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas\" to \"of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas\". The 1927 Act was also significant for opening the door to [[dominion]]s (later [[Commonwealth realm]]s) having the right to determine their own style and title for the sovereign, a right which was first exercised in 1953.\n\nThe designation \"Emperor of India\" was dropped from the royal style in 1948 after the independence of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] a year earlier,<ref name=gazette1948-06-22a>{{London Gazette |issue=38330 |date=22 June 1948 |page=3647 }} Royal Proclamation of 22 June 1948, made in accordance with the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1947/30/pdfs/ukpga_19470030_en.pdf Indian Independence Act 1947, 10 & 11 GEO. 6. CH. 30.]('Section 7: ...(2)The assent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is hereby given to the omission from the Royal Style and Titles of the words \" Indiae Imperator \" and the words \" Emperor of India \" and to the issue by His Majesty for that purpose of His Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of the Realm.'). According to this Royal Proclamation, the King retained the Style and Titles 'George VI by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith', and he thus remained King of the various Dominions, including India and Pakistan, though these two (and others) eventually chose to abandon their monarchies and became republics.</ref> even though King George VI remained king of the [[dominion of India]] until 1950, when it became a republic within the Commonwealth. The [[dominion of Pakistan]] existed between 1947 and 1956, when it too became a republic within the Commonwealth. Similarly, although the [[republic of Ireland]] was constituted in 1949, \"Great Britain and Ireland\" was not replaced with \"Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" until 1953. In the same year the phrase \"[[Head of the Commonwealth]]\" was also added, and \"British Dominions beyond the Seas\" was replaced with \"other Realms and Territories\". Thus, the style of the present sovereign is \"By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".\n\nAlso in 1953, separate styles were adopted for each of the realms over which the sovereign reigned. Most realms used the form, \"Queen of ... and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth\", omitting the title \"Defender of the Faith\". [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]] all included a reference to the United Kingdom as well as \"Defender of the Faith\", but only Canada still uses this form. (Australia dropped both the reference to the United Kingdom and \"Defender of the Faith\" in 1973; New Zealand dropped the former in 1974.) Grenada's style also includes reference to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". Curiously, the style used in Pakistan made mention of the United Kingdom, but not of Pakistan, perhaps because the nation was a Dominion only in the interim, whilst a [[republic]]an constitution was being prepared. (see [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II]] for a list the current sovereign's titles in each realm.)\n\n==List of changes to the royal style== <!-- This section is linked from [[Alfred the Great]] -->\nOfficial styles of sovereigns are shown below. Changes that only take into account the gender of the sovereign (such as replacing \"King\" with \"Queen\") are not indicated. Heads of state who did not rule as kings or as queens are shown in ''italics''.\n\n===English sovereigns===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Period\n! width=\"70%\" | Style\n! width=\"20%\" | User\n|-\n| 1066\u20131087\n| ''Rex Anglorum''<br />(King of the English)\n| <small>[[William I of England|William I]]</small>\n|-\n| 1087\u20131121\n| ''Dei Gratia Rex Anglorum''<br>(By the Grace of God King of the English)\n| <small>[[William II of England|William II]], [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]</small>\n|-\n| 1121\u20131154\n| ''Rex Anglorum, Dux Normannorum''<br />(King of the English, Duke of the Normans)\n| <small>[[Henry I of England|Henry I]], [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]</small>\n|-\n| ''1141''\n| ''Anglorum Domina''<br />(Lady of the English)\n| <small>''[[Empress Matilda|Matilda]]''</small>\n|-\n| 1154\u20131199\n| ''Rex Angliae''<br />(King of England)<br />''Rex Anglorum''<br />(King of the English)\n| <small>[[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[Henry the Young King]], [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]</small>\n|-\n| 1199\u20131259\n| ''Dei gratia Rex Anglie, Dominus Hibernie, Dux Normannie et Aqitannie, Comes Andegavie''<br />(By the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, Fellow of the Angevins)\n| <small>[[John, King of England|John]], [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]</small>\n|-\n| 1259\u20131340\n| ''Rex Angliae, Dominus Hiberniae et Dux Aquitaniae''<br />(King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine)\n| <small>[[Henry III of England|Henry III]], [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]</small>\n|-\n| 1340\u20131397\n| ''Rex Angliae et Franciae et Dominus Hiberniae''<br />(King of England and [[Hundred Years' War|of France]] and Lord of Ireland)\n| <small>[[Edward III of England|Edward III]], [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]</small>\n|-\n| 1397\u20131399\n| ''Rex Angliae et Franciae, Dominus Hiberniae et Princeps Cestri\u00e6''<br />(King of England and of France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester)<ref>''\"Richard himself was stiled Princeps Cestri\u00e6, Prince of Chester.
