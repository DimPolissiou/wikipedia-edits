The novel continues the story of Janey Wilcox, an aging [[supermodel]] first featured in Bushnell's ''Four Blondes.''<ref>{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Natasha|title=Sex through gritted teeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/16/fiction.featuresreviews3|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 August 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nJaney Wilcox's flagging career was revived when, in the closing pages of ''Four Blondes'', she accepted a contract with [[Victoria's Secret]]. ''Trading Up'' stars a slightly older and wiser Janey Wilcox, one who is determined to make it to the top.\n\nWilcox begins the novel as an older but still quite popular lingerie and runway model whose aspirations now include breaking into show business.  Fortunately, the [[New York City|New York]] social scene is dominated by powerful media mogul/starlet couples.  Spending a summer in [[the Hamptons]], Janey Wilcox befriends Mimi Kilroy, wife of media mogul George Paxton.  Kilroy introduces her new model friend to Selden Rose, an up-and-coming CEO of cable television network MovieTime.  At first Janey is uninterested in Selden and is instead enamored with Zizi, a young Argentinian polo player with model looks and the countenance of a member of the European elite.  Only in an attempt to attract Zizi does she begin dating Selden.\n\nJaney and Selden are quickly married, while Zizi begins an affair with Mimi.\n\nJaney continually struggles with her torrid past as a consummate seducer of powerful men and is known in many circles as a semi-prostitute.  Determined to become a movie producer, Janey attempts to maneuver her way to the top of the New York social scene by any means necessary, including using her younger sister and her brother-in-law, a popular rock star, for her own ends.\n\nEventually it is revealed that Janey's reputation as a prostitute is rather well-deserved and a past indiscretion with a powerful media mogul is publicly revealed.  Janey's reputation is ruined and she splits from her husband, fleeing to [[Los Angeles]].\n\nIn the end Janey has managed to get an old, crudely written screenplay (written years earlier) into the hands of the right people in Hollywood and is poised to embark on a new path as a [[Hollywood]] movie producer. The story ends on an unexpectedly triumphant note, with Janey poised to conquer Hollywood. There is a sense that the ends have justified the means. Janey's shameless ambition, her hard headed cool determination to get whatever she wants - at any cost - wins through. This isn't the expected tale of a grasping, gold digger who gets her comeuppance. It is more the tale of a beautiful woman who uses her looks as a tool to operate in a world where male ruthlessness is admired and feared, and yet her own casual callousness is deplored and scorned by those around her.\n\n==Reception==\nIn the London ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'', Stephanie Merritt wrote that the book \"succeeds because she [Bushnell] provides what readers and audiences have always craved, from Moli\u00e8re down through Wilde and Mitford to ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and the rash of current celebrity magazines\u2014a window on to the stupidities and weaknesses of the rich and powerful, inspiring an addictive mix of envy and moral superiority.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/03/fiction.features|title=Observer review: Trading Up by Candace Bushnell|first=Stephanie|last=Merritt|date=August 3, 2003|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, in [[New York Magazine]], John Homans wrote that the work was marked by the \"staggering emptiness\" of its characters who are \"human cartoons,\" each of whom \"is equipped with an empty thought bubble.\" He asked, \"Candace Bushnell helped invent the world she describes in her new novel\u2014so why does ''Trading Up'' feel like it was written by someone from [[Des Moines]]?\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/books/reviews/n_8754/|title=Trading Up - New York Magazine Book Review|website=New York Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2003 American novels]]\n[[Category:American romance novels]]\n[[Category:Chick lit novels]]\n[[Category:Hyperion Books books]]\n[[Category:Novels by Candace Bushnell]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Novels set in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2003 novel by Candace Bushnell|other books with the same title|Trading Up (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name             = Trading Up\n| image            = Trading Up (Candace Bushnell novel).jpg\n| border           = yes\n| caption          = First edition\n| author           = [[Candace Bushnell]]\n| illustrator      = \n| cover_artist     = \n| country          = \n| language         = \n| series           = \n| subject          = \n| genre            = [[Romance novel|Romance]], [[Chick lit]]\n| publisher        = [[Hyperion Books]]\n| pub_date         = 2003\n| english_pub_date = \n| media_type       = \n| pages            = 320 pp.\n| isbn =  9780316726191\n| oclc             = \n| dewey            = \n| congress         = \n| preceded_by      = Four Blondes\n| followed_by      = \n}}\n\n'''''Trading Up''''' is a 2003 romance novel by [[Candace Bushnell]].
