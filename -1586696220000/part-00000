It is a fairly recent development compared to other styles of bock beers, frequently associated with springtime and the month of May. Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 7.4% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content.

It isn't clear, with colour ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavour is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16\u201326 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer \"Salvator\" (literally \"Savior\", but actually a malapropism for \"Sankt Vater\", \"St. Father\", originally brewed for the feast of St. Francis of Paola on 2 April which often falls into Lent), which today is trademarked by [[Paulaner]].<ref name=GBI /> Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add \"[[wikt:-ator|-ator]]\" to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 \"-ator\" doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.<ref name=GBI /> The following are representative examples of the style: [[Paulaner]] Salvator, [[Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Weihenstephaner]] Korbinian, [[Andechser]] Doppelbock Dunkel, [[Spaten]] Optimator, [[Augustiner]] Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, [[Capital Brewery|Capital]] Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, [[Eggenberg Castle, Vorchdorf|Eggenberg]] Urbock 23\u00ba, [[Bell's brewery|Bell's]] Consecrator, [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]] La Rossa, [[Samuel Adams]] Double Bock, [[Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company|Tr\u00f6egs]] Tr\u00f6egenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Doppelrock, [[Abita Brewing Company|Abita]] Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, Burly Brewing's Burlynator, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.\n\n===Eisbock===\n[[File:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|Eisbock beer, made by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer, resulting in higher alcohol content.]]\nEisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the [[Kulmbach (district)|Kulmbach district]] of Germany that is made by [[freeze distillation|partially freezing]] a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume.

In 2016, he won a by-election to become the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] MPP for [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River (provincial electoral district)|Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]] in the [[Ontario legislature]]. Previously, he had been a municipal politician since 1991, most recently as a [[Toronto City Council|City Councillor]] representing [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River|Ward 42 Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]]. Before being elected, he worked as a social worker for the Catholic Children's Aid Society, the [[Toronto Board of Education]], and the Scarborough Board of Education.<ref name=\"raychopc\" />\n\nCho holds a master's degree in Social Work and Doctorate in Education from the [[University of Toronto]]. He is married to Soon Ok, and has three adult sons: Raymond Jr., Ronald, and William.<ref name=\"raychopc\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ontariopc.ca/raymond_cho |title=Raymond Cho - MPP, Scarborough-Rouge River|url-status=live |archivedate=June 3, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603183320/https://www.ontariopc.ca/raymond_cho| publisher=[[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Ontario PC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Municipal politics==\nHe was first elected to [[Metropolitan Toronto]] Council for Scarborough-Malvern in 1991, and was re-elected in 1994.  After the Scarborough and the other suburbs were amalgamated into the new City of Toronto,  Cho was elected to the new council representing Scarborough-Malvern in 1997 along with [[Bas Balkissoon]]. In 2000, he was again re-elected, representing the new ward of Scarborough Rouge-River. He won re-election in 2003, 2006 and 2010.\n\nOn August 13, 2004, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that Cho spent nearly all of his allotted councillor expense fund, one of the highest on city council. While there was some speculation that some of this money was diverted to Cho's failed bid to run in the federal election campaign, his executive assistant said the money was needed for newsletters mailed out to constituents to provide information on a rash of fatal shootings in the [[Malvern, Toronto|Malvern]] neighbourhood earlier in the year.<ref>Catherine Porter. Cho biggest spender at city hall; $53,100 limit nearly spent Councillor ran in federal election. Toronto Star. August 13, 2004. Pg. F02.</ref>\n\nCho was Chairman of the [[Toronto Zoo]] for two successive terms.\n\n==Federal politics==\nCho was a [[New Democratic Party]] candidate for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]] and was initially identified as a New Democrat when he joined Metro Council, however, he soon became an ally and supporter of then [[Metropolitan Toronto Chairman]] [[Alan Tonks]] and dropped his NDP affiliation. He subsequently took out membership in the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] though, like most non-NDP municipal politicians in [[Ontario]] he did not run on a party label in municipal elections.\n\nHe ran in the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]] as an independent candidate in [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]].  Cho called himself an \"independent Liberal\", and used the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]'s red-and-white colours for his campaign materials.  He was accused of trying to mislead voters by the official Liberal candidate, [[Derek Lee (politician)|Derek Lee]]. Lee, who has been the MP since 1988 said that Cho caused some controversy by claiming to have been shut out of the candidate nomination process.<ref>Ho Anderson. Rookies challenge Liberal MP. Toronto Star. June 19, 2004. Pg. H03.</ref> Lee won the election, Cho placed a distant second with 6,692 votes (17.8% of the total).\n\n==Provincial politics==\nIn 2005, Cho expressed interest in being the [[Ontario Liberal Party]]'s candidate in the [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]] provincial [[by-election]] which was made necessary by the appointment of incumbent Liberal [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] [[Alvin Curling]] to a diplomatic position. However, the Liberal riding association used a clause of its constitution to declare another city councillor, Bas Balkissoon, as its candidate without a contested nomination process. Media reports suggested that this was done to exclude Cho as the provincial riding association was displeased with Cho's \"independent Liberal\" candidacy in the 2004 federal election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20051005/281878703764820| first=Ian| last=Urquhart| title=Liberals play rough on by-election.

In 2016, he won a by-election to become the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] MPP for [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River (provincial electoral district)|Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]] in the [[Ontario legislature]]. Previously, he had been a municipal politician since 1991, most recently as a [[Toronto City Council|City Councillor]] representing [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River|Ward 42 Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]]. Before being elected, he worked as a social worker for the Catholic Children's Aid Society, the [[Toronto Board of Education]], and the Scarborough Board of Education.<ref name=\"raychopc\" />\n\nCho holds a master's degree in Social Work and Doctorate in Education from the [[University of Toronto]]. He is married to Soon Ok, and has three adult sons: Raymond Jr., Ronald, and William.<ref name=\"raychopc\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ontariopc.ca/raymond_cho |title=Raymond Cho - MPP, Scarborough-Rouge River|url-status=live |archivedate=June 3, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603183320/https://www.ontariopc.ca/raymond_cho| publisher=[[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Ontario PC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Municipal politics==\nHe was first elected to [[Metropolitan Toronto]] Council for Scarborough-Malvern in 1991, and was re-elected in 1994.  After the Scarborough and the other suburbs were amalgamated into the new City of Toronto,  Cho was elected to the new council representing Scarborough-Malvern in 1997 along with [[Bas Balkissoon]]. In 2000, he was again re-elected, representing the new ward of Scarborough Rouge-River. He won re-election in 2003, 2006 and 2010.\n\nOn August 13, 2004, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that Cho spent nearly all of his allotted councillor expense fund, one of the highest on city council. While there was some speculation that some of this money was diverted to Cho's failed bid to run in the federal election campaign, his executive assistant said the money was needed for newsletters mailed out to constituents to provide information on a rash of fatal shootings in the [[Malvern, Toronto|Malvern]] neighbourhood earlier in the year.<ref>Catherine Porter. Cho biggest spender at city hall; $53,100 limit nearly spent Councillor ran in federal election. Toronto Star. August 13, 2004. Pg. F02.</ref>\n\nCho was Chairman of the [[Toronto Zoo]] for two successive terms.\n\n==Federal politics==\nCho was a [[New Democratic Party]] candidate for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]] and was initially identified as a New Democrat when he joined Metro Council, however, he soon became an ally and supporter of then [[Metropolitan Toronto Chairman]] [[Alan Tonks]] and dropped his NDP affiliation. He subsequently took out membership in the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] though, like most non-NDP municipal politicians in [[Ontario]] he did not run on a party label in municipal elections.\n\nHe ran in the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]] as an independent candidate in [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]].  Cho called himself an \"independent Liberal\", and used the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]'s red-and-white colours for his campaign materials.  He was accused of trying to mislead voters by the official Liberal candidate, [[Derek Lee (politician)|Derek Lee]]. Lee, who has been the MP since 1988 said that Cho caused some controversy by claiming to have been shut out of the candidate nomination process.<ref>Ho Anderson. Rookies challenge Liberal MP. Toronto Star. June 19, 2004. Pg. H03.</ref> Lee won the election, Cho placed a distant second with 6,692 votes (17.8% of the total).\n\n==Provincial politics==\nIn 2005, Cho expressed interest in being the [[Ontario Liberal Party]]'s candidate in the [[Scarborough\u2014Rouge River]] provincial [[by-election]] which was made necessary by the appointment of incumbent Liberal [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] [[Alvin Curling]] to a diplomatic position. However, the Liberal riding association used a clause of its constitution to declare another city councillor, Bas Balkissoon, as its candidate without a contested nomination process. Media reports suggested that this was done to exclude Cho as the provincial riding association was displeased with Cho's \"independent Liberal\" candidacy in the 2004 federal election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20051005/281878703764820| first=Ian| last=Urquhart| title=Liberals play rough on by-election.

In addition, school trustees were elected to the [[Toronto District School Board]], [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]], [[Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest]] and [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]]. The election was held in conjunction with those held in other municipalities in the province of [[Ontario]] (see [[2010 Ontario municipal elections]]). Candidate registration opened on January 4, 2010 and ended on September 10. Advance polls were open October 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12, 13, 16 and 17.\n\nThere were a number of open seats as two sitting councillors, [[Rob Ford]] and [[Joe Pantalone]], ran for mayor, while incumbents [[Case Ootes]], [[Kyle Rae]], [[Adam Giambrone]], [[Michael Walker (politician)|Michael Walker]], [[Mike Feldman]], [[Brian Ashton (politician)|Brian Ashton]], and [[Howard Moscoe]] did not seek re-election. This was the first election to take place in Toronto since the enactment of a new fund raising by-law whereby unions and corporations could not donate to candidates. The nomination period for the 2010 municipal election opened on Monday, January 4, 2010 and closed on Friday, September 10, 2010.\n\nIn the 2010 election, a record number of women was elected to council, with 15 female councillors comprising exactly one third of all council members.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/881530--porter-female-breakthrough-on-toronto-city-council?bn=1 \"Porter: Female breakthrough on Toronto city council\"].

[[Vincent Crisanti]] beat [[Suzan Hall]], [[Sarah Doucette]] beat [[Bill Saundercook]], [[Jaye Robinson]] beat [[Cliff Jenkins]], [[Mary-Margaret McMahon]] beat [[Sandra Bussin]], and [[Michelle Berardinetti]] beat [[Adrian Heaps]] respectively.\n\n==School boards==\nSchool trustees were elected to the [[Toronto District School Board]], [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]], [[Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest]] and [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]].\n\n==Participation initiatives==\nContinuing a tradition established by [[City Idol]] in 2006, grassroots activist groups established a number of initiatives to encourage greater interest and participation in municipal politics.\n\nOne notable initiative in 2010 was Better Ballots, an advocacy group which sponsored a debate concerning municipal voting reform on June 1. Preparations for that debate included an online ballot to name two of the \"minor\" mayoral candidates to the debate panel, in addition to the six \"major\" ones. The winners of the online vote were Rocco Achampong and [[Keith Cole (artist)|Keith Cole]].<ref>[http://www.insidetoronto.com/news/cityhall/article/828239--better-ballots-hosts-mayor-s-debate \"Better Ballots hosts mayor's debate\"]. insidetoronto.com, June 3, 2010.</ref> When Giorgio Mammoliti withdrew from the mayoral race on July 5, he singled out Achampong as a candidate who \"needs to be heard\", and asked the media to give Achampong his former space in the debates.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/832088--mammoliti-quits-mayoral-race?bn=1 \"Mammoliti quits mayoral race\"], ''Toronto Star'', July 5, 2010</ref>\n\nAnother initiative was So You Think You Can Council, an event hosted by comedian [[Maggie Cassella]] which featured Ward 27's council candidates answering questions about Toronto's municipal government in a [[game show]] format.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/822121--so-you-think-you-can-council \"So You Think You Can Council?\"].

Advance polls were open October 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12, 13, 16 and 17.\n\nThere were a number of open seats as two sitting councillors, [[Rob Ford]] and [[Joe Pantalone]], ran for mayor, while incumbents [[Case Ootes]], [[Kyle Rae]], [[Adam Giambrone]], [[Michael Walker (politician)|Michael Walker]], [[Mike Feldman]], [[Brian Ashton (politician)|Brian Ashton]], and [[Howard Moscoe]] did not seek re-election. This was the first election to take place in Toronto since the enactment of a new fund raising by-law whereby unions and corporations could not donate to candidates. The nomination period for the 2010 municipal election opened on Monday, January 4, 2010 and closed on Friday, September 10, 2010.\n\nIn the 2010 election, a record number of women was elected to council, with 15 female councillors comprising exactly one third of all council members.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/881530--porter-female-breakthrough-on-toronto-city-council?bn=1 \"Porter: Female breakthrough on Toronto city council\"].

At the end of the campaign there were three major candidates who were included by the media in public opinion polls and mayoral debates: winner [[Rob Ford]], [[Joe Pantalone]], and [[George Smitherman]].<ref>David Rider \"[https://www.thestar.com/yourcitymycity/article/796057--ford-surges-into-second-place-in-mayoral-poll?bn=1 Ford surges into second place in mayoral poll]\" ''[[Toronto Star]]'' Fri Apr 16 2010</ref><ref>Marcus Gee \"[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/torontos-mayoral-candidates-face-off-for-the-first-time/article1516056/ Toronto's mayoral candidates face off for the first time]\" ''The Globe and Mail.''

There were a number of open seats, as sitting councillors Joe Pantalone and Rob Ford chose to run for mayor, while long-serving incumbents [[Case Ootes]], [[Kyle Rae]], [[Adam Giambrone]], [[Mike Feldman]], [[Michael Walker (politician)|Michael Walker]], [[Brian Ashton (politician)|Brian Ashton]] and [[Howard Moscoe]] announced their retirements.\n\nFive incumbent councillors were defeated, in wards 1, 13, 25, 32, and 35:. [[Vincent Crisanti]] beat [[Suzan Hall]], [[Sarah Doucette]] beat [[Bill Saundercook]], [[Jaye Robinson]] beat [[Cliff Jenkins]], [[Mary-Margaret McMahon]] beat [[Sandra Bussin]], and [[Michelle Berardinetti]] beat [[Adrian Heaps]] respectively.\n\n==School boards==\nSchool trustees were elected to the [[Toronto District School Board]], [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]], [[Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest]] and [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]].\n\n==Participation initiatives==\nContinuing a tradition established by [[City Idol]] in 2006, grassroots activist groups established a number of initiatives to encourage greater interest and participation in municipal politics.\n\nOne notable initiative in 2010 was Better Ballots, an advocacy group which sponsored a debate concerning municipal voting reform on June 1. Preparations for that debate included an online ballot to name two of the \"minor\" mayoral candidates to the debate panel, in addition to the six \"major\" ones. The winners of the online vote were Rocco Achampong and [[Keith Cole (artist)|Keith Cole]].<ref>[http://www.insidetoronto.com/news/cityhall/article/828239--better-ballots-hosts-mayor-s-debate \"Better Ballots hosts mayor's debate\"]. insidetoronto.com, June 3, 2010.</ref> When Giorgio Mammoliti withdrew from the mayoral race on July 5, he singled out Achampong as a candidate who \"needs to be heard\", and asked the media to give Achampong his former space in the debates.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/832088--mammoliti-quits-mayoral-race?bn=1 \"Mammoliti quits mayoral race\"], ''Toronto Star'', July 5, 2010</ref>\n\nAnother initiative was So You Think You Can Council, an event hosted by comedian [[Maggie Cassella]] which featured Ward 27's council candidates answering questions about Toronto's municipal government in a [[game show]] format.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/822121--so-you-think-you-can-council \"So You Think You Can Council?\"].

''Murray4Mayor'' was spearheaded by ''[[National Post]]'' cartoonist [[Chip Zdarsky|Steve Murray]],<ref>[http://torontoist.com/2010/10/steve_murray_hates_toronto_and_wants_to_be_your_mayor.php \"Steve Murray Hates Toronto, and Wants to Be Your Mayor\"].

She subsequently got involved in the [[cooperative housing]] movement in [[Welland, Ontario|Welland]], and later became a community development coordinator for Hamilton's McQuesten Legal & Community Services, providing public legal education to groups working with tenants, injured workers and people with disabilities.\n \nIn 1996 Horwath earned a certificate of achievement in anti-racism training, and was an organizer of Hamilton's Days of Action campaign against provincial government cutbacks announced by [[Mike Harris]]. That year she received the Woman of the Year Award in Public Affairs from the Hamilton Status of Women Committee, in recognition of her work in the community. She also dedicated her time and efforts toward the field of social housing, and was subsequently awarded the Graham Emslie Award for Community Development in Housing by the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association.\n\nShe lives in Hamilton with her son Julian (born November 1992).

Although unsuccessful, her second-place finish was a significant improvement on previous NDP efforts in the riding, and gave her an increased level of prominence in the city.\n\n===City councillor===\nLater in 1997, she was elected to [[Hamilton, Ontario City Council|Hamilton City Council]] for Ward Two, outpolling two [[incumbent]]s who had represented the area for more than 20 years. She emerged as a prominent voice for the political left in the city, and was re-elected to council in 2000 and 2003. During her three terms as city councillor, she chaired the solid-waste-management committee and the municipal non-profit housing corporation.\n\n==Provincial politics==\n\n===By-election victory===\nHorwath was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in a 2004 by-election in the then-extant provincial [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Hamilton East (provincial electoral district)|Hamilton East]], defeating [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] candidate Ralph Agostino to succeed the deceased Liberal member [[Dominic Agostino]], Ralph's brother. Winning 63.6 per cent of the vote, up from the NDP's 29.4 per cent in that riding six months earlier, her landslide victory boosted the NDP's seat count over the threshold for [[official party status]] in the legislature, and helped give the federal [[New Democratic Party]] a bounce in Hamilton that would continue into the [[2004 Canadian federal election|federal election]] shortly thereafter.\n\n===2007 election===\nIn the [[2007 Ontario general election|2007 election]], Horwath ran in the new riding of [[Hamilton Centre]], due to [[redistricting]] that divided her former Hamilton East riding between Hamilton Centre and the new riding of [[Hamilton East\u2014Stoney Creek]]. Horwath's new Hamilton Centre riding included approximately half of her former riding as well as a portion of the former Hamilton West riding where she had run federally in 1997. It also included her entire former city council ward.\n\nIn the lead up to the campaign, Horwath was expected to face Hamilton West Liberal incumbent [[Judy Marsales]]. However, Marsales opted not to run for another term, and Horwath easily defeated Liberal candidate Steve Ruddick on election day.\n\n===2009 NDP leadership campaign===\n[[File:Andrea Horwath 2009.jpg|thumb|Horwath during a debate in the 2009 NDP leadership election]]\nOn November 7, 2008, Horwath officially launched her campaign to win the party's leadership. The [[2009 Ontario New Democratic Party leadership election|leadership election]] was held March 6\u20138, 2009.

She subsequently got involved in the [[cooperative housing]] movement in [[Welland, Ontario|Welland]], and later became a community development coordinator for Hamilton's McQuesten Legal & Community Services, providing public legal education to groups working with tenants, injured workers and people with disabilities.\n \nIn 1996 Horwath earned a certificate of achievement in anti-racism training, and was an organizer of Hamilton's Days of Action campaign against provincial government cutbacks announced by [[Mike Harris]]. That year she received the Woman of the Year Award in Public Affairs from the Hamilton Status of Women Committee, in recognition of her work in the community. She also dedicated her time and efforts toward the field of social housing, and was subsequently awarded the Graham Emslie Award for Community Development in Housing by the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association.\n\nShe lives in Hamilton with her son Julian (born November 1992). In a March 2011 interview with the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', she spoke publicly for the first time about the breakup of her longtime relationship with Julian's father, Hamilton businessman Ben Leonetti.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2011/03/11/horwath_opens_up_about_life_as_a_single_mom.html |title=Horwath opens up about life as a single mom |date=March 11, 2011 |work=thestar.com |access-date=November 11, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307154436/http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2011/03/11/horwath_opens_up_about_life_as_a_single_mom.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Horwath had met Ben Leonetti in her university years, when she was working part-time as a waitress and he was a jazz musician.

Although unsuccessful, her second-place finish was a significant improvement on previous NDP efforts in the riding, and gave her an increased level of prominence in the city.\n\n===City councillor===\nLater in 1997, she was elected to [[Hamilton, Ontario City Council|Hamilton City Council]] for Ward Two, outpolling two [[incumbent]]s who had represented the area for more than 20 years. She emerged as a prominent voice for the political left in the city, and was re-elected to council in 2000 and 2003. During her three terms as city councillor, she chaired the solid-waste-management committee and the municipal non-profit housing corporation.\n\n==Provincial politics==\n\n===By-election victory===\nHorwath was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in a 2004 by-election in the then-extant provincial [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Hamilton East (provincial electoral district)|Hamilton East]], defeating [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] candidate Ralph Agostino to succeed the deceased Liberal member [[Dominic Agostino]], Ralph's brother. Winning 63.6 per cent of the vote, up from the NDP's 29.4 per cent in that riding six months earlier, her landslide victory boosted the NDP's seat count over the threshold for [[official party status]] in the legislature, and helped give the federal [[New Democratic Party]] a bounce in Hamilton that would continue into the [[2004 Canadian federal election|federal election]] shortly thereafter.\n\n===2007 election===\nIn the [[2007 Ontario general election|2007 election]], Horwath ran in the new riding of [[Hamilton Centre]], due to [[redistricting]] that divided her former Hamilton East riding between Hamilton Centre and the new riding of [[Hamilton East\u2014Stoney Creek]]. Horwath's new Hamilton Centre riding included approximately half of her former riding as well as a portion of the former Hamilton West riding where she had run federally in 1997. It also included her entire former city council ward.\n\nIn the lead up to the campaign, Horwath was expected to face Hamilton West Liberal incumbent [[Judy Marsales]]. However, Marsales opted not to run for another term, and Horwath easily defeated Liberal candidate Steve Ruddick on election day.\n\n===2009 NDP leadership campaign===\n[[File:Andrea Horwath 2009.jpg|thumb|Horwath during a debate in the 2009 NDP leadership election]]\nOn November 7, 2008, Horwath officially launched her campaign to win the party's leadership. The [[2009 Ontario New Democratic Party leadership election|leadership election]] was held March 6\u20138, 2009. Horwath led on the first two ballots, and won on the third ballot with 60.4% of the vote defeating [[Peter Tabuns]], [[Gilles Bisson]] and [[Michael Prue]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/horwath-wins-ontario-ndp-leadership/article1149744/ |title=Horwath wins Ontario NDP leadership |last=Campbell |first=Murray |date=March 7, 2009 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2011 election===\nThe [[2011 Ontario general election|2011 provincial election]] saw a rise in support for the NDP under Horwath's leadership. The party won more than 20% of the popular vote for the first time since [[1995 Ontario general election|1995]] and almost doubled its seats to elect 17 members of the legislature. The election also resulted in the Liberal government of [[Dalton McGuinty]] being reduced to a [[minority government]] with the NDP holding the balance of power.\n\nIn April 2012, Horwath passed a [[leadership review]] at the party's convention with 76% support.\n\n===2014 election===\n[[File:Rassemblement du Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique de l'Ontario, Sudbury - 26 mai 2014.JPG|thumb|left|Horwath during the [[2014 Ontario general election|2014 provincial election campaign]]]]\nIn the [[2014 Ontario general election|2014 provincial election]], the NDP was able to maintain its seat count of 21 at dissolution despite the loss of three seats in Toronto, but lost the balance of power when the Liberals took a majority win in the election.

General [[Frederick Middleton]] arrived in April 1885 with 950 soldiers, established a garrison at the station, and used it as his base for scouting operations. At that time, the Humboldt station was crucial, since the telegraph line further west was periodically cut \u2013 so Humboldt was the last secure link to the East.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |work = University of Regina\n  | title = District of Saskatchewan Map 1885\n  | url =http://esask.uregina.ca/management/app/assets/img/enc2/PDF/51C276D2-1560-95DA-430F6CC3E32921701.pdf\n  | accessdate =2013-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOn May 1, 1885, Humboldt became the site of a large supply depot under Maj.

Built in 1878, the Humboldt Telegraph Station<ref>[http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/Search.do?ex=on&R=VE_1318&lang=en A Line Through the Wilderness]</ref> played an integral part in communications for the developing West.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humboldt.ca/default.aspx?page=31 |title= Humboldt History |publisher= City of Humboldt |accessdate= 2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] uprising led by [[Louis Riel]] taking place at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]] just 100&nbsp;km northwest, Humboldt became the only communication link between Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]] and his forces in the West, thus a site of strategic significance. General [[Frederick Middleton]] arrived in April 1885 with 950 soldiers, established a garrison at the station, and used it as his base for scouting operations. At that time, the Humboldt station was crucial, since the telegraph line further west was periodically cut \u2013 so Humboldt was the last secure link to the East.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |work = University of Regina\n  | title = District of Saskatchewan Map 1885\n  | url =http://esask.uregina.ca/management/app/assets/img/enc2/PDF/51C276D2-1560-95DA-430F6CC3E32921701.pdf\n  | accessdate =2013-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOn May 1, 1885, Humboldt became the site of a large supply depot under Maj. Lt.-Colonel G. T. Denison of the Governor Generals' Body Guard. A combined force of approximately 460 men built an elaborate series of entrenchments, converting the station into a fortified military encampment to protect the supplies.  The troops left Humboldt in July 1885.

It's a bit perverse but then you've got to understand our sense of humour. The 'Big Chair' idea is from this brilliant film called ''Sybil'' about a girl with 16 different personalities. She'd been tortured incredibly by her mother as a child and the only place she felt safe, the only time she could really be herself was when she was sitting in her analyst's chair.

The album peaked at number two in the UK and at number one in the US and Canada, becoming a multi-platinum seller in all three countries. It also reached number one in Germany and the Netherlands and Top 10 positions in various other countries including Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand and Italy. It spawned the international hit singles \"[[Mothers Talk]]\", \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\", \"[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head over Heels]]\", and \"[[I Believe (Tears for Fears song)|I Believe]]\". It remains their best-selling album to date.\n\nA companion video documentary entitled ''[[Scenes from the Big Chair]]'' was released in late 1985. Once the band had finished a lengthy touring and promotion schedule for the album, they took an extended hiatus from the music industry.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote=\"The title was my idea. It's a bit perverse but then you've got to understand our sense of humour. The 'Big Chair' idea is from this brilliant film called ''Sybil'' about a girl with 16 different personalities. She'd been tortured incredibly by her mother as a child and the only place she felt safe, the only time she could really be herself was when she was sitting in her analyst's chair. She felt safe, comfortable and wasn't using her different faces as a defence. It's kind of an 'up yours' to the English music press who really fucked us up for a while.
