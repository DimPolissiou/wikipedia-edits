The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines.<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> This led to the creation of the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model, the first true electric sports car, powered by next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Its design, technology and level of performance left their mark and paved the way for other electric Venturis such as the Volage, an electric concept [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] car with 8 [[Active Wheel]] [[in-wheel motor]]s from French tire giant [[Michelin]], or the America, an electric SUV.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]], allowing the firm to enter the motorcycle market.\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. With its Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet...

High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines,<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> leading to the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model. More recent models are the [[Venturi Eclectic|Eclectic]], the world's first energy-autonomous vehicle, a low speed vehicle that has solar panels and a built-in wind charger and can be plugged in; and the [[Venturi Astrolab|Astrolab]], the world's first solar-electric hybrid car. There have been approximately 60-65 orders for the F\u00e9tish, but only about 30 have been delivered as of 2011.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n<br />\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. With its Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet...

[[Pinoy rock]] was soon followed by [[Pinoy folk]] and later, Pinoy jazz.<ref name=\"Dance of Life\"/> Although the music was often used to express opposition to then [[President of the Philippines|Philippine president]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his use of [[martial law]] and the creating of the [[Batasang Bayan]], many of the songs were more subversive and some just instilled national pride. Perhaps because of the cultural affirming nature and many of the songs seemingly being non-threatening, the Marcos administration ordered radio stations to play at least one - and later, three - Pinoy songs each hour.<ref name=\"Dance of Life\"/> Pinoy music was greatly employed both by Marcos and political forces who sought to overthrow him.<ref name=\"Dance of Life\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tisoy]]\n* [[Demographics of the Philippines]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines]]\n* [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Philippines topics}}\n{{Ethnic groups in the Philippines}}\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Filipino slang]]\n[[Category:Pejoratives]]\n[[Category:Filipino diaspora]]\n[[Category:Demonyms]]\n", "name_user": "Abdulmughal11233", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinoy"}

Throughout 1987 and 1988, Yamada improved with each match, occasionally getting shots at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, most notably against [[Owen Hart]] on June 10, 1988, and against [[Shiro Koshinaka]] on December 9, 1988. He would also take part in the first ever [[Best of the Super Juniors|Top of the Super Juniors]] where he earned 31 points, not enough to progress to the final. Within months of his second Canadian excursion, NJPW called him back, as they needed him for a [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] based on an extremely popular [[anime]] [[superhero]], ''[[Jushin Liger (anime)|Jushin Liger]]'', created by [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Go Nagai]].<ref name=SlamBio/><ref name=WWE/> NJPW had done this previously with [[Tiger Mask]], which had become a huge success. Yamada was given a superhero-like full body costume and a demonic looking mask, resembling the superhero type featured in [[tokusatsu]] and anime programs.\n\n====IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion (1989\u20132000)====\n[[File:Jushin Thunder Liger 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2007]]\nYamada as \"Jushin Liger\" returned to NJPW on April 24, 1989, at the [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref name=OWOW/> In the character's debut match, he defeated [[Kuniaki Kobayashi]].<ref name=SlamBio/> He has also wrestled all the [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tigers]] to date (from Mark Rocco in 1989 to [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]] in 2009). The Liger character underwent changes in conjunction with the Go Nagai anime progressing and its hero powering up. In January 1990, Liger was renamed \"Jushin Thunder Liger\", a name he continues to use to this day.<ref name=NJPW/> He quickly became one of NJPW's top junior heavyweights, eventually capturing the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship eleven times,<ref name=WWE/> between May 25, 1989 and December 6, 1999, among numerous other titles and accolades while wrestling around the world. When appearing without his mask on, Yamada blocks his appearance by covering his face with one hand.\n\nEarly in his career, Yamada's style mostly consisted of high flying. Years later, he started adapting more power moves and started focusing more on grappling and telling a story in the ring; part of this change was due to the fact that Liger had to reduce the stress he was putting on his body after undergoing brain tumor surgery in August 1996, which explained why he lost his match to [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] in the first round of the [[J-Crown]] tournament.<ref name=SlamBio/> He also had the opportunity to wrestle [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] on July 17, in which he lost.\n\nLiger has won two [[Super J-Cup]] tournaments in [[Super J-Cup (1995)|1995]] and [[Super J-Cup (2000)|2000]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n====Kishin Liger (1996, 2006, 2012, 2019)====\nOn October 20, 1996, [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] faced off in a match with Liger. As the match progressed, Muta resorted to his underhand tactics that had become his style over the years. He tore at Liger's mask and eventually ripped it off, but Liger kept his face down on the mat. After grabbing a chair outside the ring, Muta entered the ring but before he could hit Liger with it, Liger stood up and revealed his face to be painted pale white with red writings and spit mist into Muta's face (another Muta trademark). He tore off his bodysuit and revealed a painted chest, then proceeded to fight more aggressively the rest of the match, despite losing the match to Muta.\n\nOn July 30, 2006, Liger revived the \"Kishin Liger\" gimmick and faced off with rival Bad Boy Hido in NJPW.<ref name=Central/> The story was that Hido had cut a piece of Liger's hair and Liger vowed revenge, so he transformed into Kishin Liger. Liger won the match with a [[brainbuster]] onto a steel chair. Liger's next appearance as Kishin Liger took place in June 2012 and was brought on by [[Taichi Ishikari|Taichi]] tearing his mask to pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |title=Dominion 6.16 |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] |language=Japanese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619045237/http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |archivedate=June 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nKishin Liger returned again on September 22, 2019 at Destruction in Kobe, when [[Minoru Suzuki]] removed Liger's mask. Kishin would spit mist into Suzuki's face and attempt to stab him with a spike, before giving chase to Suzuki while attacking officials, young lions, and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in his pursuit.\n\nThe gimmick is a variation of The Great Muta gimmick which relies on bloody and evil tactics in a match, using mannerisms and imagery that differ from the person's normal ways. This gimmick also uses many wrestling moves that are regulars in The Great Muta's move set, such as the [[Asian mist]].\n\n====Heavyweight division (2000)====\nDuring 2000, as [[List of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] [[Riki Choshu]] decided to de-emphasize the junior heavyweight division (a costly decision that diminished its credibility), Liger wrestled heavyweights without wearing the upper part of his bodysuit or his mask horns (the first time he wore that attire was on February 24, 1994, against Shinya Hashimoto in a non-title match between the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/NJReview-TVAsahi94.html|title=New Japan World Pro Wrestling, 3/5/94|last=Mancuso|first=Ryan|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Junior heavyweight veteran (2001\u20132020)====\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Liger was the leader of the NJPW [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] stable Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) along with [[Hirooki Goto]], [[Minoru Tanaka (wrestler)|Minoru Tanaka]], [[Rocky Romero|Black Tiger IV]], [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]], [[Shoji Akiyoshi|Jado]], [[Fergal Devitt|Prince Devitt]] and briefly [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]].<ref name=Central>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/liger.html|title=Puroresu Central profile|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=April 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jushin Liger ROHxNJPW Global Wars 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2018]]\nCTU was disbanded in August 2007, when Liger decided CTU would disband while at the top of NJPW, Liger would then join Masahiro Chono's Legend stable.<ref name=OWOW/> The Legend stable would disband in February 2010, after Chono, Choshu and [[Akira Nogami|Akira]]'s departures.\n\nSince then, Liger has mainly teamed with fellow veteran Tiger Mask, remaining outside of championship contention for the most part.

Becoming Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger the following year, he saw unprecedented success in the [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|junior heavyweight]] division, winning the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] a record 11 times, as well as setting the record for longest reign with the title during his second reign at 628 days.

After graduating high school in the early 1980s, he would apply to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]'s (NJPW) dojo in the hope of becoming a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].<ref name=SlamBio/> He was not accepted because he did not meet the height requirements the dojo had at that time.<ref name=SlamBio/> Yamada, determined not to give up his dream of becoming a professional wrestler, left for [[Mexico]] and began his training there.<ref name=SlamBio/> By his own account, he was almost starving while studying in Mexico, due to this NJPW officials who were visiting took pity on him and asked him to come back to Japan to train in their dojo.<ref name=SlamBio/> In the NJPW dojo, he trained alongside the likes of [[Keiji Mutoh]], [[Masahiro Chono]] and [[Shinya Hashimoto]].<ref name=SlamBio/> While continuing his training, he had his debut match in March 1984 at the age of 19, wrestling against [[Shunji Kosugi]].<ref name=OWOW/><ref name=SlamBio/> He began studying various [[martial arts]] styles because he wanted to add something new and different to his wrestling style, which is how he learned his ''[[Professional wrestling attacks#Rolling wheel kick|Abisegeri]]'' kick. In 1985, Yamada participated in the [[Young Lion Cup]] and got to the final of the tournament before being defeated by Shunji Kosugi. In the beginning of 1986, Yamada participated in the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] League but lost to [[Mark Rocco|Black Tiger]]. On July 19, 1986, Yamada faced [[Nobuhiko Takada]] in a losing effort in his first of many IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship matches.\n\n===All Star Wrestling (1986\u20131987, 1989, 2014)===\nAfter winning the [[Young Lion Cup]] in March 1986,<ref name=SlamBio/> he went on an excursion of Europe, where he wrestled for [[All Star Wrestling]] in [[England]], under the name \"Flying\" Fuji Yamada.<ref name=SlamBio/><ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingspiritmagazine.co.uk/art/news/159/jushin-thunder-liger-joins-the-uk-revolution|title=Jushin Thunder Liger Joins The UK Revolution|date=February 9, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2017|work=[[Fighting Spirit Magazine]]}}</ref> He won the World Heavy Middleweight Championship twice, once in September 1986 and once in March 1987, both times defeating \"Rollerball\" [[Mark Rocco]] and both times losing it back to him, the last of these title changes being televised on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=OWOW/> Yamada would later visit All Star again in 1989, with tag partner [[Masakatsu Funaki|Flying Funaki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishwrestlingarchive.co.uk/1989%20RESULTS.htm|title=1989 results|accessdate=July 2, 2010|work=British Wrestling Archive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405230950/http://www.britishwrestlingarchive.co.uk/1989%20RESULTS.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He returned to Britain in 2014 to work once again for All Star Wrestling, this time under his masked Jushin Liger identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCcfg3FyhBI&t=3423s|title=All Star Wrestling FULL SHOW featuring Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger from Croydon 3/10/2014 ASW UK|last=Dean Allmark|date=October 5, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Stampede Wrestling (1987, 1989)===\nYamada went on an excursion in [[Canada]], around May 1987, where he wrestled in [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]] in [[Calgary]] under his real name.<ref name=SlamBio/> He also trained under Hart in the legendary \"[[Hart House (Alberta)#The Dungeon|Dungeon]]\".<ref name=SlamBio/> His experiences there led him to refer to Hart as a \"very, very tough man.\" He would return to Calgary in January 1989.{{CN|date=January 2020}}\n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling===\n\n====Return and character change (1987\u20131988)====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jyushin Liger 1989.jpg|thumb|right|Liger in 1989]] -->\nAfter returning to Japan in August 1987, Yamada debuted his Shooting Star Press in a match against Masakatsu Funaki, for which he had gotten the idea from reading the [[manga]] ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''. Throughout 1987 and 1988, Yamada improved with each match, occasionally getting shots at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, most notably against [[Owen Hart]] on June 10, 1988, and against [[Shiro Koshinaka]] on December 9, 1988. He would also take part in the first ever [[Best of the Super Juniors|Top of the Super Juniors]] where he earned 31 points, not enough to progress to the final. Within months of his second Canadian excursion, NJPW called him back, as they needed him for a [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] based on an extremely popular [[anime]] [[superhero]], ''[[Jushin Liger (anime)|Jushin Liger]]'', created by [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Go Nagai]].<ref name=SlamBio/><ref name=WWE/> NJPW had done this previously with [[Tiger Mask]], which had become a huge success. Yamada was given a superhero-like full body costume and a demonic looking mask, resembling the superhero type featured in [[tokusatsu]] and anime programs.\n\n====IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion (1989\u20132000)====\n[[File:Jushin Thunder Liger 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2007]]\nYamada as \"Jushin Liger\" returned to NJPW on April 24, 1989, at the [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref name=OWOW/> In the character's debut match, he defeated [[Kuniaki Kobayashi]].<ref name=SlamBio/> He has also wrestled all the [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tigers]] to date (from Mark Rocco in 1989 to [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]] in 2009). The Liger character underwent changes in conjunction with the Go Nagai anime progressing and its hero powering up. In January 1990, Liger was renamed \"Jushin Thunder Liger\", a name he continues to use to this day.<ref name=NJPW/> He quickly became one of NJPW's top junior heavyweights, eventually capturing the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship eleven times,<ref name=WWE/> between May 25, 1989 and December 6, 1999, among numerous other titles and accolades while wrestling around the world. When appearing without his mask on, Yamada blocks his appearance by covering his face with one hand.\n\nEarly in his career, Yamada's style mostly consisted of high flying. Years later, he started adapting more power moves and started focusing more on grappling and telling a story in the ring; part of this change was due to the fact that Liger had to reduce the stress he was putting on his body after undergoing brain tumor surgery in August 1996, which explained why he lost his match to [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] in the first round of the [[J-Crown]] tournament.<ref name=SlamBio/> He also had the opportunity to wrestle [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] on July 17, in which he lost.\n\nLiger has won two [[Super J-Cup]] tournaments in [[Super J-Cup (1995)|1995]] and [[Super J-Cup (2000)|2000]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n====Kishin Liger (1996, 2006, 2012, 2019)====\nOn October 20, 1996, [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] faced off in a match with Liger. As the match progressed, Muta resorted to his underhand tactics that had become his style over the years. He tore at Liger's mask and eventually ripped it off, but Liger kept his face down on the mat. After grabbing a chair outside the ring, Muta entered the ring but before he could hit Liger with it, Liger stood up and revealed his face to be painted pale white with red writings and spit mist into Muta's face (another Muta trademark). He tore off his bodysuit and revealed a painted chest, then proceeded to fight more aggressively the rest of the match, despite losing the match to Muta.\n\nOn July 30, 2006, Liger revived the \"Kishin Liger\" gimmick and faced off with rival Bad Boy Hido in NJPW.<ref name=Central/> The story was that Hido had cut a piece of Liger's hair and Liger vowed revenge, so he transformed into Kishin Liger. Liger won the match with a [[brainbuster]] onto a steel chair. Liger's next appearance as Kishin Liger took place in June 2012 and was brought on by [[Taichi Ishikari|Taichi]] tearing his mask to pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |title=Dominion 6.16 |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] |language=Japanese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619045237/http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |archivedate=June 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nKishin Liger returned again on September 22, 2019 at Destruction in Kobe, when [[Minoru Suzuki]] removed Liger's mask. Kishin would spit mist into Suzuki's face and attempt to stab him with a spike, before giving chase to Suzuki while attacking officials, young lions, and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in his pursuit.\n\nThe gimmick is a variation of The Great Muta gimmick which relies on bloody and evil tactics in a match, using mannerisms and imagery that differ from the person's normal ways. This gimmick also uses many wrestling moves that are regulars in The Great Muta's move set, such as the [[Asian mist]].\n\n====Heavyweight division (2000)====\nDuring 2000, as [[List of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] [[Riki Choshu]] decided to de-emphasize the junior heavyweight division (a costly decision that diminished its credibility), Liger wrestled heavyweights without wearing the upper part of his bodysuit or his mask horns (the first time he wore that attire was on February 24, 1994, against Shinya Hashimoto in a non-title match between the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/NJReview-TVAsahi94.html|title=New Japan World Pro Wrestling, 3/5/94|last=Mancuso|first=Ryan|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Junior heavyweight veteran (2001\u20132020)====\nFrom 2004\u20132007, Liger was the leader of the NJPW [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] stable Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) along with [[Hirooki Goto]], [[Minoru Tanaka (wrestler)|Minoru Tanaka]], [[Rocky Romero|Black Tiger IV]], [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]], [[Shoji Akiyoshi|Jado]], [[Fergal Devitt|Prince Devitt]] and briefly [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]].<ref name=Central>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/liger.html|title=Puroresu Central profile|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=April 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jushin Liger ROHxNJPW Global Wars 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2018]]\nCTU was disbanded in August 2007, when Liger decided CTU would disband while at the top of NJPW, Liger would then join Masahiro Chono's Legend stable.<ref name=OWOW/> The Legend stable would disband in February 2010, after Chono, Choshu and [[Akira Nogami|Akira]]'s departures.\n\nSince then, Liger has mainly teamed with fellow veteran Tiger Mask, remaining outside of championship contention for the most part.

Dark Elves are on every street corner, attacking everyone they can get their hands on. But even without a suit, Eddie can't let innocent people fall prey to the Dark Elves. With nothing but his fists, he challenges Malekith's forces. Obviously, his efforts, raw strength and heroism is enough to attract the attention of one of Malekith's War Witches, who approaches Eddie with a dangerous gift, a Dreamstone, which brings life to dreams and desires. Seeing a golden opportunity to become a weapon and lethal protector once more, Eddie takes the stone, which grants him his wish. He creates an artificial symbiote similar to Venom, but much taller and thinner, almost ghoulish-looking with spikes that cover large portions of his body and razor-sharp claws. Eddie also realizes that this murderous creature has no mind of its own.<ref>''Venom'' Vol.4 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Marvel Gamerverse==\n{{See also|Spider-Man (2018 video game)}}\nIn Earth-1048, during a conversation between Spider-Man and [[Yuri Watanabe]], she quickly ask Spider-Man as a joke if he has a black and white suit indicating that Spider-Man at some point had a black suit but he got rid of it. When Spider-Man looks through certain windows there is a few collectibles on a shelf, including a black suit Spider-Man figure.\nIn the last post-credits scene reveals [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Marvel Gamerverse|Norman Osborn]] entering a secret lab. The secret lab contains '''[[Harry Osborn]]''' \u2013 who is childhood friend of [[Spider-Man (Insomniac Games)|Peter]] and [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Marvel Gamerverse|Mary Jane]] and is suffering from a degenerative disease which he inherited from his [[Emily Osborn|mother]] \u2013 in a strange chamber labeled '''GR-35''' (Ultimate Venom appeared in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #35) with a black web-like substance, presumed to be the symbiote after it reacts to Norman. Eddie Brock is also mentioned in a \"Good Luck\" letter from ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' to Peter meaning that he still works there, but doesn't hold any rancor towards Peter, while Flash Thompson is outside the country helping veterans according to Peter while looking at some papers at the FEAST.<ref>{{Cite game |title=[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]|developer=[[Insomniac Games]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=September 2018|platform=[[PlayStation 4]]|version= |scene= |level= |language= |quote=I love you dad.}}</ref>\n\n== Contest of Champions ==\nAn alternate version of Eddie Brock appears as Venom in the 2015 Contest of Champions miniseries as one of the Grandmaster's champions. This version killed his version of [[Spider-Man]] and wears his costume as a cape, but Eddie hears Peter Parker's voice in his head. He is eventually killed by [[Punisher 2099]] with a disintegration gun in the same place where [[Sentry (comics)|the Sentry]] and [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] were seemingly killed. The symbiote fuses with the Sentry and Void's remains and  turned into some Void/symbiote hybrids named Symbioids. When Stick reveals his survival, he merges their energies to resurrect the Sentry.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Al Ewing]]|penciller=[[Paco Medina]]|editor=Mark Paniccia|title=Contest of Champions|issue=#6|date=23 March 2016|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\n== House of M ==\nIn ''[[House of M]]'' an actor portrays Venom.\n\n==LEGO Marvel Super Heroes ==\nOn Earth-13122, Venom is minifigure character appearing in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n\n== Ultimate Marvel ==\n[[File:Venom (Ultimate Marvel version).jpg|thumb|upright|Venom (Ultimate Marvel version).]]\nThe Ultimate iteration of Venom was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]] and was introduced in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #33, while the Conrad Markus version was introduced in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man Volume 2]]'' #16.1. His appearance was designed by Mark Bagley to be more of a monster than a supervillain, describing him as a \"huge cancerous/tumorous creature\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/books/2017/07/14/marvel-legacy-spider-man-venom/|title=Marvel Legacy: Spider-Man goes back to basics, Venom becomes a protector|author=[[Entertaiment Weekly]]|date=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Eddie Brock was a writer for the Daily Globe. He was at [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]]'s press conference; his face is not shown, only his hands and arms appear.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate incarnation of Venom is vastly different from the mainstream incarnation: ''Eddie Brock Jr.'' is Peter Parker's childhood friend (along with a college student who is a lab assistant for [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Curtis Connors]]) and the Venom symbiote is not extraterrestrial but is the second stage of a genetically created \"suit\" designed by ''[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'' (Peter's father) and ''Eddie Brock Sr.'' (Eddie's father) as a cure for severe disease meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA (Richard's in this case), and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed on others to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a [[pupa]], as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Venom suit was introduced when Peter Parker reunited with his childhood friend Eddie Brock Jr. to continue their fathers' research into a protoplasmic cure for cancer. Eddie Sr. had kept the suit in the lab for his son as his legacy. After finding that [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] had tried to weaponize his father's research, Peter attempted to steal a sample to conduct his own research on, but spilled it by accident.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father. Feeding off Spider-Man's own thoughts, the suit enhanced his strength, generated its own webbing, and made him completely bulletproof. But when Spider-Man was chasing down an armed robber, the suit attempted to take over him, growing a fanged maw. After fighting for control, Spider-Man electrocuted the suit before returning to destroy the sample. Enraged, Eddie ignored Peter's warnings and used a second sample of the Venom suit on himself. Eddie, wearing the Venom suit, initially resembled a bulkier version of Spider-Man but the suit grew a fanged mouth, claws, tentacles and spinal ridges. Eddie hunted down Peter, intending to force him to be absorbed in the suit but was electrocuted by downed power lines and retreated.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33-39.

Then [[Beetle (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Beetle]] tried to capture Venom, but Venom escaped and was confronted by Spider-Man. During a battle the suit eventually separated itself from Eddie and forcibly bonded itself with Peter, turning him into Venom. The [[Ultimates]] arrived and were able to separate Peter from the suit. Eddie later approached Peter and demanded that he retrieve the suit for him but was rebuffed. During a confrontation between Peter, Eddie and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], Gwen transformed into [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]. Contact with Carnage caused trace amounts of the suit within Eddie's body to multiply, transforming him into Venom, at which point the two symbiotes began to fight. After a brief battle the Venom symbiote absorbed all traces of the Carnage symbiote, leaving Gwen an ordinary human, and causing Venom to change into a new form even larger than before, with small glowing red eyes. Venom retreated from battle, and was later captured by the Beetle and taken to Latveria.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #123-128.

The first version's initial host is [[Harry Osborn]] and also has a strong resemblance to the mainstream iteration. The second iteration's main host is [[Flash Thompson]] as Agent Venom.\n* The titular character from the 2018 film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' is suggested to have borrowed a few elements from this version of Venom, most notably the fact that its origin and appearance is on most part independent of the influence of Spider-Man. In other words, the latter was not a direct or indirect cause of Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote bonding together, so Venom does not possess any of Spider-Man's powers but instead sports his own set of similar powers. Thus, the original story and character arc are not fully incorporated into the film.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' film, Peter Parker from Miles Morales's dimension mentions Venom in the \"Spidey-Bells\" song.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is presumed to be the black web-like substance wrapping around a sick Harry Osborn in the very last post-credits scene in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' acting as life support and is presumed to be in the sequel.\n\n== MC2 ==\nIn ''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'', the Venom symbiote was separated from Eddie Brock and remained trapped in containment for more than a decade.

The hybrid named herself \"April Parker\" and went on to live with the real Spider-Girl's family (her [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]], [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], and Peter) and starts to go school where she befriends May's friends especially Gene Thompson, [[Flash Thompson#MC2|Flash Thompson]]'s son.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #10-11.

At the debut fashion show for the line, Peter Parker is photographing with Mary Jane Watson wearing one of the dresses, unaware of its true nature.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the audience is the [[Power Pack]] in their civilian identities, invited by Peter as a thank you for their help in the previous two issues. When the symbiotes hear Peter's name, their genetic memory recognizes it and they turn Mary Jane and the other three models into She-Venoms, and attack.  The Power Pack join Spider-Man in the battle, during which Spider-Man briefly corners the designer and gets the truth out of him about the clones.  The symbiote clones are sheared from their unwilling hosts, three by a sonic boom produced by [[Julie Power]]/Lightspeed's superhuman speed, the other by an energy burst from [[Katie Power]]/Energizer.  The battle is then won when [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Jack Power]]/Mass Master uses the music booth to blast them all with high audio, crippling them long enough to be captured.  During the battle, however, one symbiote clone manages to briefly make contact with Katie Power's alien-born costume, causing it to become \"infected\" by the Venom symbiote's evil and vengeful desires (the kids' costumes in this continuity are semi-biological themselves, a concept later reinforced during a later mini-series when one is seen to repair damage to itself on its own).  This causes Katie's costume to take on a Venom-like appearance, with the only differences being it is obviously smaller and Katie's energy burst symbol takes the place of the spider symbol's main body, the spider legs remaining.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe [[Kymellian]] costume-turned-symbiote completely takes control of the little girl at night, using her to team with the [[Sinister Six]] to capture Spider-Man, and then turn on the other members of Power Pack, Katie's own siblings, to take revenge on them for their part in the symbiote clones' defeat.  In the final battle, Julie Power manages to find and free Spider-Man, and together they manage to get [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to blast all the villains, including himself, with a large electrical discharge powerful enough to render them all unconscious and again shear the costume-turned-symbiote off of Katie, the discharge purging Katie's costume of the \"infection\" in the process, restoring it to normal.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n== Marvel Zombies ==\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' mini-series on Earth-2149, Venom briefly appears as one of the many zombified villains. He fights the zombie [[Spider-Man]], who quickly kills him, because the Symbiote has started to die, being unable to absorb adrenaline from Eddie Brock's zombified body. He died very early at the hands of the zombie Spider-Man himself before Zombie Spider-Man goes on. Like his [[Earth 616]] counterpart, he has cancer and the Symbiote doesn't want to be with him. Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, his disease is not cured and he is instead destroyed. Before he died, Brock managed to sputter out that he and the symbiote are dying, to which the zombie Spider-Man states that Venom is breaking his cold, dead heart.<ref>{{Cite comic\n\n| Writer = Robert Kirkman\n\n| Penciller = Sean Phillips\n\n| Inker = Sean Phillips\n\n| Story = Marvel Zombies (Part Four)\n\n| Title = Marvel Zombies\n\n| Volume = 1\n\n| Issue = 4\n\n| Date = May 2006\n\n| Publisher = Marvel Comics\n\n}}</ref>\n\n== 100th Anniversary Special Spider-Man ==\nIn an alternate universe of Earth-TRN421, in the year 2061, after '''[[Wilson Fisk]]''' killed Eddie Brock in a confrontation, he got the symbiote and modified it giving it the ability to travel through technology.

Kron as a child was continually abused by the android housekeeper which thought that Kron was a dog and he has always been a bully and takes enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill his brother. \nIn his introduction, Stone gave the orders to have [[Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]' family killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife and dumped his body into the sewer.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2</ref> Following the altercation Kron lay dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball. The ball then bonded to him and formed a new Venom. The symbiote was described as having mutated over the years, and displayed new abilities in this timeline, including acidic blood and saliva.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #35.

The future Spider-Man and Venom fought and Spider-Man was the victor. After the fight he had the town turn on sonics through all of the speakers, thus neutralizing Venom. They then brought him back to the lab for study. It was revealed that the symbiote bonded with Kron on a molecular level, giving Kron an amorphous physiology that allowed his body to take on the properties of the symbiote itself.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37.

When she was a child, her left arm was badly burned in a crash that also resulted in the death of her mother. Raised by her father, Theo, Alea was bullied at school over her scars. She was then selected to undergo an experimental treatment being developed by Alchemax scientist Dr. Russell. She regainexd consciousness to find that the treatment had worked and her arm was restored. During a confrontation the next day with a girl at school, a black tendril emerged from her hand and sliced through the Alchemax monitoring bracelet. Alea heard a sinister voice in her head, her left arm transforming into a jet-black limb tipped with razor-sharp claws. Returning home, Alea learned that the purported panacea she'd been treated with was a piece of a symbiote called Venom, and that Alchemax intended to turn her into a supersoldier using it. Empathizing with its pain, felt, Alea reluctantly agreed to the symbiote's request to be made whole in exchange for her getting her normal life back. Infiltrating Alchemax, Alea was accosted by a pair of guards and was horrified when the symbiote killed them to protect her. As the symbiote scolded her innocent naivety, Alea protested that she didn't want to be seen as a monster. Arriving at the lab containing the other pieces of the symbiote, Alea shut down the containment grid, but was knocked unconscious by Dr. Russell. The Venom symbiote, reclaiming its disparate pieces, bonded to Alea, transformed her into Venom and had eaten Dr. Russell as revenge for cutting it apart. Disgusted, Alea reiterated that she didn't want to become a monster and asked if they could be a hero instead; the Venom symbiote begrudgingly agreeing to her request. At school the following day, Alea transformed into Venom to terrify her bully. However, the symbiote was abruptly overcome by the will of a dark god. Alarmed, Alea asked the Venom symbiote what had happened and it told her that the god of its species, [[Knull (comics)|Knull]], was somehow still alive and on Earth.\n\n;Other versions\n* A variant of Venom 2099 appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] along with another version of the Vulture and Doctor Octopus.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 3 #23.</ref>\n* [[Timestorm 2009-2099]]'s version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] is [[Kron Stone]].<ref>''Timestorm 2009-2099'' #1</ref>\n\n;In other media\n* Scorpion 2099 is a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[John Kassir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=2010-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723174322/http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|archive-date=2010-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-deadly-villains-of-spider-man-shattered-dimensions?page=9|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]''. \n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n\n== Spider-Man Unlimited ==\nIn the animated series and second issue of the comic series ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage appear as re-occurring villains, stowing away on [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s shuttle on its way to Counter-Earth and in subsequent appearances attempting to infect the citizens of Counter-Earth with symbiotes and serving a hive-mind called the Synoptic.

Upon meeting him, Venom is quick to berate Spider-Man for abandoning him all those years ago with a genuine sense of bitterness and sorrow, describing himself as a responsibility that Spider-Man neglected, leaving the wallcrawler at a loss for words. Defeated, the Sinister Six, Spidey and Venom have their final battle, in which [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] gives Spider-Man a detonator to make all the Sinners explode.

The symbiote eventually influences him to confront and beat Spider-Man, but before it can kill the Web Slinger, Castle's soldierly discipline wins out. With his new powers, Punisher takes out [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and even the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. At the climax of a confrontation with Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Moon Knight]], from which the Punisher emerges victorious, a blast from Spider-Man's borrowed sonic blaster allows Punisher to overcome and tame the symbiote by convincing it that his war on crime means more to him than anything, even his own life, and would sooner commit suicide and kill them both if he did not have complete control over it.\n\nThe symbiote then recedes from Punisher's face and manifests his trademark Skull insignia upon his chest.

Deciding to make the best of things, they all settle down and build new lives and families. Twenty-five years later, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are a single entity. With Reed Richards dead, there was no way to free Spider-Man from the symbiote and thus he was forced to accept this new way of life. Over time he becomes cold, calculating and emotionally distant from the rest of the group. The body of Peter Parker is now nothing more than a skeleton with the symbiote acting as his skin, much to the dismay of the other super-heroes and their children.<ref>''What If...''

Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again in a new form and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first host. After cocooning Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent monster called [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#What If?|Poison]]. Poison longs for a companion to join them in their new life and chooses Mary Jane. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting her. She promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life as miserable as possible. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken and he flees. Instead, he unearths the grave of [[Gwen Stacy]].

While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine and the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating '''Venompool'''. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier.

His appearance was designed by Mark Bagley to be more of a monster than a supervillain, describing him as a \"huge cancerous/tumorous creature\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/books/2017/07/14/marvel-legacy-spider-man-venom/|title=Marvel Legacy: Spider-Man goes back to basics, Venom becomes a protector|author=[[Entertaiment Weekly]]|date=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Eddie Brock was a writer for the Daily Globe. He was at [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]]'s press conference; his face is not shown, only his hands and arms appear.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate incarnation of Venom is vastly different from the mainstream incarnation: ''Eddie Brock Jr.'' is Peter Parker's childhood friend (along with a college student who is a lab assistant for [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Curtis Connors]]) and the Venom symbiote is not extraterrestrial but is the second stage of a genetically created \"suit\" designed by ''[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'' (Peter's father) and ''Eddie Brock Sr.'' (Eddie's father) as a cure for severe disease meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA (Richard's in this case), and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed on others to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a [[pupa]], as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Venom suit was introduced when Peter Parker reunited with his childhood friend Eddie Brock Jr. to continue their fathers' research into a protoplasmic cure for cancer. Eddie Sr. had kept the suit in the lab for his son as his legacy. After finding that [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] had tried to weaponize his father's research, Peter attempted to steal a sample to conduct his own research on, but spilled it by accident.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father. Feeding off Spider-Man's own thoughts, the suit enhanced his strength, generated its own webbing, and made him completely bulletproof. But when Spider-Man was chasing down an armed robber, the suit attempted to take over him, growing a fanged maw. After fighting for control, Spider-Man electrocuted the suit before returning to destroy the sample. Enraged, Eddie ignored Peter's warnings and used a second sample of the Venom suit on himself. Eddie, wearing the Venom suit, initially resembled a bulkier version of Spider-Man but the suit grew a fanged mouth, claws, tentacles and spinal ridges. Eddie hunted down Peter, intending to force him to be absorbed in the suit but was electrocuted by downed power lines and retreated.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> \nEddie was then captured by [[Silver Sable#Ultimate Marvel|Silver Sable]], who was hired by Bolivar since the suit technically belonged to him and ordered [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Adrian Toomes]] to conduct his experiments on the suit in an attempt to remove the suit from Eddie. Then [[Beetle (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Beetle]] tried to capture Venom, but Venom escaped and was confronted by Spider-Man. During a battle the suit eventually separated itself from Eddie and forcibly bonded itself with Peter, turning him into Venom. The [[Ultimates]] arrived and were able to separate Peter from the suit. Eddie later approached Peter and demanded that he retrieve the suit for him but was rebuffed. During a confrontation between Peter, Eddie and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], Gwen transformed into [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]. Contact with Carnage caused trace amounts of the suit within Eddie's body to multiply, transforming him into Venom, at which point the two symbiotes began to fight. After a brief battle the Venom symbiote absorbed all traces of the Carnage symbiote, leaving Gwen an ordinary human, and causing Venom to change into a new form even larger than before, with small glowing red eyes. Venom retreated from battle, and was later captured by the Beetle and taken to Latveria.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #123-128. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the video game, it is implied that Eddie Sr. and Venom are responsible for the plane crash which killed Peter's parents. After Peter Parker becomes Carnage and fights Venom. Carnage is defeated and absorbed by Venom, and as a result Venom develops the trademark white spider symbol and Eddie Brock gains full control of the suit.\n\nVenom appeared with his trademark white spider symbol in ''[[Ultimates 3]]''.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]] (w), [[Madureira, Joe]] (a), ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attacks the Ultimates' [[Avengers Mansion#Ultimate Marvel|mansion]], demanding to find [[Alternative versions of Scarlet Witch#Ultimate Marvel|the woman]].

The first version's initial host is [[Harry Osborn]] and also has a strong resemblance to the mainstream iteration. The second iteration's main host is [[Flash Thompson]] as Agent Venom.\n* The titular character from the 2018 film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' is suggested to have borrowed a few elements from this version of Venom, most notably the fact that its origin and appearance is on most part independent of the influence of Spider-Man. In other words, the latter was not a direct or indirect cause of Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote bonding together, so Venom does not possess any of Spider-Man's powers but instead sports his own set of similar powers. Thus, the original story and character arc are not fully incorporated into the film.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' film, Peter Parker from Miles Morales's dimension mentions Venom in the \"Spidey-Bells\" song.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is presumed to be the black web-like substance wrapping around a sick Harry Osborn in the very last post-credits scene in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' acting as life support and is presumed to be in the sequel.\n\n== MC2 ==\nIn ''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'', the Venom symbiote was separated from Eddie Brock and remained trapped in containment for more than a decade.

The Power Pack join Spider-Man in the battle, during which Spider-Man briefly corners the designer and gets the truth out of him about the clones.  The symbiote clones are sheared from their unwilling hosts, three by a sonic boom produced by [[Julie Power]]/Lightspeed's superhuman speed, the other by an energy burst from [[Katie Power]]/Energizer.

During the battle, however, one symbiote clone manages to briefly make contact with Katie Power's alien-born costume, causing it to become \"infected\" by the Venom symbiote's evil and vengeful desires (the kids' costumes in this continuity are semi-biological themselves, a concept later reinforced during a later mini-series when one is seen to repair damage to itself on its own).  This causes Katie's costume to take on a Venom-like appearance, with the only differences being it is obviously smaller and Katie's energy burst symbol takes the place of the spider symbol's main body, the spider legs remaining.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe [[Kymellian]] costume-turned-symbiote completely takes control of the little girl at night, using her to team with the [[Sinister Six]] to capture Spider-Man, and then turn on the other members of Power Pack, Katie's own siblings, to take revenge on them for their part in the symbiote clones' defeat.  In the final battle, Julie Power manages to find and free Spider-Man, and together they manage to get [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to blast all the villains, including himself, with a large electrical discharge powerful enough to render them all unconscious and again shear the costume-turned-symbiote off of Katie, the discharge purging Katie's costume of the \"infection\" in the process, restoring it to normal.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n== Marvel Zombies ==\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' mini-series on Earth-2149, Venom briefly appears as one of the many zombified villains. He fights the zombie [[Spider-Man]], who quickly kills him, because the Symbiote has started to die, being unable to absorb adrenaline from Eddie Brock's zombified body. He died very early at the hands of the zombie Spider-Man himself before Zombie Spider-Man goes on. Like his [[Earth 616]] counterpart, he has cancer and the Symbiote doesn't want to be with him. Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, his disease is not cured and he is instead destroyed. Before he died, Brock managed to sputter out that he and the symbiote are dying, to which the zombie Spider-Man states that Venom is breaking his cold, dead heart.<ref>{{Cite comic\n\n| Writer = Robert Kirkman\n\n| Penciller = Sean Phillips\n\n| Inker = Sean Phillips\n\n| Story = Marvel Zombies (Part Four)\n\n| Title = Marvel Zombies\n\n| Volume = 1\n\n| Issue = 4\n\n| Date = May 2006\n\n| Publisher = Marvel Comics\n\n}}</ref>\n\n== 100th Anniversary Special Spider-Man ==\nIn an alternate universe of Earth-TRN421, in the year 2061, after '''[[Wilson Fisk]]''' killed Eddie Brock in a confrontation, he got the symbiote and modified it giving it the ability to travel through technology.

Kron as a child was continually abused by the android housekeeper which thought that Kron was a dog and he has always been a bully and takes enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill his brother. \nIn his introduction, Stone gave the orders to have [[Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]' family killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife and dumped his body into the sewer.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2</ref> Following the altercation Kron lay dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball. The ball then bonded to him and formed a new Venom. The symbiote was described as having mutated over the years, and displayed new abilities in this timeline, including acidic blood and saliva.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new power, Stone sought to emotionally torture Miguel\u2014whom Kron never discovered was his half-brother\u2014by hurting those close to him, going so far as to kill Miguel's former love Dana\u2014who was also Tyler's lover. The future Spider-Man and Venom fought and Spider-Man was the victor. After the fight he had the town turn on sonics through all of the speakers, thus neutralizing Venom. They then brought him back to the lab for study. It was revealed that the symbiote bonded with Kron on a molecular level, giving Kron an amorphous physiology that allowed his body to take on the properties of the symbiote itself.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, after the symbiote was separated from Kron, it merged with Roman the Sub-Mariner, the son of [[Namor (comics)|Namor]], who fled to the ocean and is never seen again.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #38</ref> It was later shown that part of the symbiote is at the [[Alchemax]] lab for studying.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #44</ref>\n\nWhen the series was introduced as a one-shot in 2099, it introduced '''Alea Bell''' as the new Venom 2099. When she was a child, her left arm was badly burned in a crash that also resulted in the death of her mother. Raised by her father, Theo, Alea was bullied at school over her scars. She was then selected to undergo an experimental treatment being developed by Alchemax scientist Dr. Russell. She regainexd consciousness to find that the treatment had worked and her arm was restored. During a confrontation the next day with a girl at school, a black tendril emerged from her hand and sliced through the Alchemax monitoring bracelet. Alea heard a sinister voice in her head, her left arm transforming into a jet-black limb tipped with razor-sharp claws. Returning home, Alea learned that the purported panacea she'd been treated with was a piece of a symbiote called Venom, and that Alchemax intended to turn her into a supersoldier using it. Empathizing with its pain, felt, Alea reluctantly agreed to the symbiote's request to be made whole in exchange for her getting her normal life back. Infiltrating Alchemax, Alea was accosted by a pair of guards and was horrified when the symbiote killed them to protect her. As the symbiote scolded her innocent naivety, Alea protested that she didn't want to be seen as a monster. Arriving at the lab containing the other pieces of the symbiote, Alea shut down the containment grid, but was knocked unconscious by Dr. Russell. The Venom symbiote, reclaiming its disparate pieces, bonded to Alea, transformed her into Venom and had eaten Dr. Russell as revenge for cutting it apart. Disgusted, Alea reiterated that she didn't want to become a monster and asked if they could be a hero instead; the Venom symbiote begrudgingly agreeing to her request. At school the following day, Alea transformed into Venom to terrify her bully. However, the symbiote was abruptly overcome by the will of a dark god. Alarmed, Alea asked the Venom symbiote what had happened and it told her that the god of its species, [[Knull (comics)|Knull]], was somehow still alive and on Earth.\n\n;Other versions\n* A variant of Venom 2099 appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] along with another version of the Vulture and Doctor Octopus.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 3 #23.</ref>\n* [[Timestorm 2009-2099]]'s version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] is [[Kron Stone]].<ref>''Timestorm 2009-2099'' #1</ref>\n\n;In other media\n* Scorpion 2099 is a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[John Kassir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=2010-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723174322/http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|archive-date=2010-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-deadly-villains-of-spider-man-shattered-dimensions?page=9|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]''. \n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n\n== Spider-Man Unlimited ==\nIn the animated series and second issue of the comic series ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage appear as re-occurring villains, stowing away on [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s shuttle on its way to Counter-Earth and in subsequent appearances attempting to infect the citizens of Counter-Earth with symbiotes and serving a hive-mind called the Synoptic.

Upon meeting him, Venom is quick to berate Spider-Man for abandoning him all those years ago with a genuine sense of bitterness and sorrow, describing himself as a responsibility that Spider-Man neglected, leaving the wallcrawler at a loss for words. Defeated, the Sinister Six, Spidey and Venom have their final battle, in which [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] gives Spider-Man a detonator to make all the Sinners explode.

His Earth (Earth-TRN644) was eradicated by the Poisons so he gathered Venoms from across the multiverse in order to prevent the Poisons consuming more of them. He is captured by the Poisons and he realises that instead of bringing more Venoms to fight, he had brought the Poisons more Venoms to consume.

At the time a young girl from Nigeria named '''Ngozi''' who was in a wheelchair bonded to the symbiote, allowing her to walk again.

The suit takes control of Spider-Man and as it constantly feeds on him, Spider-Man ages at an accelerated rate. Within days, Spider-Man dies of old age. Desperate to survive, the symbiote bonds with a weakened [[Hulk]]. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] confronts Venom-Hulk. The costume explains that it is sorry for Spider-Man's death, but is draining the gamma radiation from Bruce Banner as repentance. Thor in disbelief defeats him, leading the symbiote to take over Thor. Banner however is shown cured of being The Hulk. The heroes employ [[Black Bolt]]'s incredibly powerful voice to create enough sonic damage to critically injure the symbiote.\n\nThor is freed, and the heroes prepare to transport the alien to another dimension. [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] takes matters into her own hands and kills the alien because of anger at the death of Spider-Man.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Fingeroth, Danny]] | penciller=Bagley, Mark|inker=[[Keith Williams (comics)|Williams, Keith]] | story=What if the Alien costume had possessed Spider-Man?|title=[[What If (comics)|What If]] | volume=2|issue=4|date=October 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n=== ...Venom had possessed The Punisher? ===\nIn this one-shot issue, after the symbiote leaves Spider-Man, it joins with the [[Punisher]] instead of Eddie Brock. Castle uses the symbiote's abilities to further his war on crime; he used the suit's shape-shifting nature to create glider-wings and used its webbing as bullets.\n\nThe symbiote causes the Punisher's war to become more brutal and unrestrained than ever before as he set about confronting and killing many super-criminals. The symbiote eventually influences him to confront and beat Spider-Man, but before it can kill the Web Slinger, Castle's soldierly discipline wins out. With his new powers, Punisher takes out [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and even the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. At the climax of a confrontation with Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Moon Knight]], from which the Punisher emerges victorious, a blast from Spider-Man's borrowed sonic blaster allows Punisher to overcome and tame the symbiote by convincing it that his war on crime means more to him than anything, even his own life, and would sooner commit suicide and kill them both if he did not have complete control over it.\n\nThe symbiote then recedes from Punisher's face and manifests his trademark Skull insignia upon his chest. Castle tells the assembled heroes that he is in control now before making his escape.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Busiek, Kurt]] | artist=[[McDonnell, Luke]] | story=What if Venom had possessed The Punisher?|title=What If| volume=2| issue=44|date=December 1992|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n=== ...The Marvel Super-Heroes had remained on Battleworld? ===\nIn this one-shot issue, the Marvel Super-Heroes and Villains left alive from the [[Secret Wars]] after [[Galactus]]' and the [[Beyonder]]'s fatal battle find themselves trapped on Battleworld. Deciding to make the best of things, they all settle down and build new lives and families. Twenty-five years later, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are a single entity. With Reed Richards dead, there was no way to free Spider-Man from the symbiote and thus he was forced to accept this new way of life. Over time he becomes cold, calculating and emotionally distant from the rest of the group. The body of Peter Parker is now nothing more than a skeleton with the symbiote acting as his skin, much to the dismay of the other super-heroes and their children.<ref>''What If...'' Vol. 2, #114</ref>\n\n=== ...Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? ===\nThis one-shot issue presents a different approach to the events of ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'', where Peter Parker dies and is resurrected with greater spider powers. Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again in a new form and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first host. After cocooning Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent monster called [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#What If?|Poison]]. Poison longs for a companion to join them in their new life and chooses Mary Jane. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting her. She promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life as miserable as possible. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken and he flees. Instead, he unearths the grave of [[Gwen Stacy]]. The last images reveal Poison watching over a new cocoon like his own, but crimson colored, as it bursts forth showing a hand similar to [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]'s.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[David, Peter]] | penciller=Pham, Khoi|inker=[[Florea, Sandu]] | story=What if Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? - Poison Selves|title=What If| volume=3| issue=2|date=November 2006|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page=| panel=}}</ref>\n\n=== ...Iron Man: Demon in an Armor ===\nIn this one shot, which happens to take place in Earth-90211, Spider-Man has the Venom symbiote costume. Wade Wilson, as [[Deadpool]], is hired by Galactus to kill the Beyonder for merging [[MODOK]] to Galactus's rear end in exchange for the Community Cube. He was given a weapon called the Recton Expungifier, the only weapon that could kill the Beyonder. When Deadpool tracked down his target to a night club, he was enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle, getting [[Jheri curl]]s in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine and the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating '''Venompool'''. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier. He decides to get himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunken [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Demon in an Armor|Tony Stark]] to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]]. Unfortunately, he can't join any major superhero teams, like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Fantastic Four]] because of his newly acquired Jheri curls.\n\n== In ''[[What The--?!]]'' ==\nIn the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' universe, \"The Bee-Yonder\" gives Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform.<ref>''Spider-Ham'' #17.</ref> In issue #20, Pork Grind, a pig version of Venom is introduced as an enemy of [[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]]. He was a [[Wild Boar]] from Australia, who accepted a deal with a supervillain to become Pork Grind, because every Superhero needs to have an evil counterpart. He was much stronger than Spider-Ham, who was smashed by him like paper. Spider-Ham in an attempt to stop Pork Grind, he ate some spinach and was able to finally defeat him.\n\n==Spider-Cat==\nIn the Spider-Cat universe Venom is a pigeon.<ref>''Spider-Island: I Love New York City'' #1</ref>\n\n== Transformers ==\nIn the universe of Earth- 91274 where the ''[[Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' series is set, Peter Parker appears still wearing his original Black Suit and goes to cover a story about the evil [[Decepticons]] who stole components of a nuclear power plant to build their base in the side of a mountain in Oregon.

Dr. [[Hank Pym]] had experimented on the symbiote in order to find a way to adapt it for use to outfit Stark's new armors with, however these experiments had destroyed what conscious it had left but it was still able to retain its biological properties of replacing missing limbs. During the period where Stark held the Dark Avengers, [[June Covington]] telepathically manipulated Pym into helping her restore her teammates to fight.
