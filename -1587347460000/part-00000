Hellenisms in the language itself point to a Greek-era origin. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus ad quem]]'' and not ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus a quo]]''. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of [[alchemy]] clothed in philosophical metaphor. And one text, the ''Asclepius'', lost in Greek but partially preserved in Latin, contained a bloody prophecy of the end of Roman rule in Egypt and the resurgence of pagan Egyptian power. Thus, it would be fair to assess the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as intellectually eclectic.<ref>[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/corpus.html Secretum secretorum \u2013 An Overview of Magic in the Greco-Roman World]</ref>\n\nMore recent research, while affirming the late dating in a period of [[Syncretism|syncretic]] cultural ferment in Roman Egypt, suggests more continuity with the culture of Pharaonic Egypt than had previously been believed.<ref>Fowden, Garth, The Egyptian Hermes : a historical approach to the late pagan mind (Cambridge/New York : Cambridge University Press), 1986</ref> There are many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods but the closest comparisons can be found in Egyptian [[wisdom literature]], which is characteristically couched in words of advice from a \"father\" to a \"son\".<ref>[[Jean-Pierre Mah\u00e9]], \"Preliminary Remarks on the Demotic \"Book of Thoth\" and the Greek Hermetica\" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''50'''.4 (1996:353-363) p.358f.</ref> [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (late Egyptian) [[Papyrus|papyri]] contain substantial sections of a dialogue of Hermetic type between Thoth and a disciple.<ref>See R.

The impetus for this revival came from the [[Latin]] translation by [[Marsilio Ficino]], a member of the [[Cosimo de' Medici|de' Medici]] [[court (royal)|court]], who published a collection of thirteen tractates in 1471, as ''De potestate et sapientia Dei''.<ref>Among the treasures of the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam is this ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as published in 1471.</ref> The ''Hermetica'' provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on [[alchemy]] and modern magic as well as influencing philosophers such as [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], Ficino's student. This influence continued as late as the 17th century with authors such as Sir [[Thomas Browne]].\n\nAlthough the most famous examples of Hermetic literature were products of [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers under Roman rule, the genre did not suddenly stop with the fall of the Empire but continued to be produced in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine Greek]]. The most famous example of this later Hermetica is the ''Emerald Tablet'', known from medieval Latin and Arabic manuscripts with a possible Syriac source. Little else of this rich literature is easily accessible to non-specialists. The mostly gnostic [[Nag Hammadi Library]], discovered in 1945, also contained one previously unknown hermetic text called ''[[The Ogdoad and the Ennead]]'', a description of a hermetic initiation into gnosis that has led to new perspectives on the nature of Hermetism as a whole, particularly due to the research of [[Jean-Pierre Mah\u00e9]].<ref>Mah\u00e9, ''Herm\u00e8s en Haute Egypte'' 2 vols. (Quebec) 1978, 1982.</ref>\n\n==Standard editions==\n[[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]]'s historically important 1650 translation into [[English language|English]] of the ''Corpus Hermeticum'', entitled ''The Divine Pymander in XVII books'' (London, 1650) was from Ficino's Latin translation; it is no longer considered reliable by scholars.{{Citation needed|date 2020-0419}} Another translation of both the Pimander and Asclepius was completed in 2020.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Corpus-Hermeticum-Power-Wisdom-God/dp/0995769222/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&qid=1584081384&sr=1-12</ref>.

Hellenisms in the language itself point to a Greek-era origin. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus ad quem]]'' and not ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus a quo]]''. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of [[alchemy]] clothed in philosophical metaphor. And one text, the ''Asclepius'', lost in Greek but partially preserved in Latin, contained a bloody prophecy of the end of Roman rule in Egypt and the resurgence of pagan Egyptian power. Thus, it would be fair to assess the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as intellectually eclectic.<ref>[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/corpus.html Secretum secretorum \u2013 An Overview of Magic in the Greco-Roman World]</ref>\n\nMore recent research, while affirming the late dating in a period of [[Syncretism|syncretic]] cultural ferment in Roman Egypt, suggests more continuity with the culture of Pharaonic Egypt than had previously been believed.<ref>Fowden, Garth, The Egyptian Hermes : a historical approach to the late pagan mind (Cambridge/New York : Cambridge University Press), 1986</ref> There are many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods but the closest comparisons can be found in Egyptian [[wisdom literature]], which is characteristically couched in words of advice from a \"father\" to a \"son\".<ref>[[Jean-Pierre Mah\u00e9]], \"Preliminary Remarks on the Demotic \"Book of Thoth\" and the Greek Hermetica\" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''50'''.4 (1996:353-363) p.358f.</ref> [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (late Egyptian) [[Papyrus|papyri]] contain substantial sections of a dialogue of Hermetic type between Thoth and a disciple.<ref>See R.

The impetus for this revival came from the [[Latin]] translation by [[Marsilio Ficino]], a member of the [[Cosimo de' Medici|de' Medici]] [[court (royal)|court]], who published a collection of thirteen tractates in 1471, as ''De potestate et sapientia Dei''.<ref>Among the treasures of the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam is this ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as published in 1471.</ref> The ''Hermetica'' provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on [[alchemy]] and modern magic as well as influencing philosophers such as [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], Ficino's student. This influence continued as late as the 17th century with authors such as Sir [[Thomas Browne]].\n\nAlthough the most famous examples of Hermetic literature were products of [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers under Roman rule, the genre did not suddenly stop with the fall of the Empire but continued to be produced in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine Greek]]. The most famous example of this later Hermetica is the ''Emerald Tablet'', known from medieval Latin and Arabic manuscripts with a possible Syriac source. Little else of this rich literature is easily accessible to non-specialists. The mostly gnostic [[Nag Hammadi Library]], discovered in 1945, also contained one previously unknown hermetic text called ''[[The Ogdoad and the Ennead]]'', a description of a hermetic initiation into gnosis that has led to new perspectives on the nature of Hermetism as a whole, particularly due to the research of [[Jean-Pierre Mah\u00e9]].<ref>Mah\u00e9, ''Herm\u00e8s en Haute Egypte'' 2 vols. (Quebec) 1978, 1982.</ref>\n\n==Standard editions==\n[[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]]'s historically important 1650 translation into [[English language|English]] of the ''Corpus Hermeticum'', entitled ''The Divine Pymander in XVII books'' (London, 1650) was from Ficino's Latin translation; it is no longer considered reliable by scholars. Another translation of both the Pimander and Asclepius was completed in 2020.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Corpus-Hermeticum-Power-Wisdom-God/dp/0995769222/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&qid=1584081384&sr=1-12</ref>.

While Tsai has never departed fundamentally from the party line, her personal approach to the issue is nuanced and evolving.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election cycle, Tsai said that she disagreed with the [[1992 Consensus]] as the basis for negotiations between Taiwan and mainland China, that such a consensus only served to buttress the \"[[One China Principle]]\", and that \"no such consensus exists\" because the majority of the Taiwanese public does not necessarily agree with this consensus. She believed that broad consultations should be held at all levels of Taiwanese society to decide the basis on which to advance negotiations with Beijing, dubbed the \"[[Taiwan consensus]]\". During the 2016 election cycle, Tsai was notably more moderate, making \"maintaining the status quo\" the centerpiece of party policy. She vowed to work within the Republic of China governing framework in addition to preserving the progress made in cross-strait relations by previous governments, while preserving \"freedom and democracy\" for the residents of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://udn.com/news/story/7983/827842-%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%A9%E5%B2%B8%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87-%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E7%8F%BE%E7%8B%80|script-title=zh:\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff1a\u5169\u5cb8\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5247 \u7dad\u6301\u73fe\u72c0|website=udn.com|access-date=22 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823071607/http://udn.com/news/story/7983/827842-%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%A9%E5%B2%B8%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87-%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E7%8F%BE%E7%8B%80|archive-date=23 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTsai believes in the importance of economic and trade links with mainland China, but publicly spoke out against the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]] (ECFA), a preferential trade agreement that increased economic links between Taiwan and mainland China.

While Tsai has never departed fundamentally from the party line, her personal approach to the issue is nuanced and evolving.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election cycle, Tsai said that she disagreed with the [[1992 Consensus]] as the basis for negotiations between Taiwan and mainland China, that such a consensus only served to buttress the \"[[One China Principle]]\", and that \"no such consensus exists\" because the majority of the Taiwanese public does not necessarily agree with this consensus. She believed that broad consultations should be held at all levels of Taiwanese society to decide the basis on which to advance negotiations with Beijing, dubbed the \"[[Taiwan consensus]]\". During the 2016 election cycle, Tsai was notably more moderate, making \"maintaining the status quo\" the centerpiece of party policy.

The name was later changed because of misdelivered mail between New Paradise and the town of [[Paradise, Pennsylvania]] in neighboring [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]].\n\nThe name ''Jacobus'' (j\u0103-K\u014c-b\u016ds) was derived from the name of the town's postmaster, Jacob Geiselman (1829-1909). To correct the problem of the misdelivered mail, the [[United States Post Office Department]] notified Geiselman to change the name of the post office. However, Geiselman was unable to think of another name. Therefore, the mail was sorted and forwarded to Geiselman labeled as,\"Jacob-US Mail;\" which was later shortened to \"Jacob-US.\"  The post office was then renamed Jacobus, and the town was renamed accordingly. In 1929, Jacobus became an incorporated Borough under Pennsylvania law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Commemorative Book|title=Commemorating the 150th year of the founding of the borough of Jacobus, York County, Pennsylvania, 1837-1987|year=1987|publisher=Mehl ad associates|location=York, Pennsylvania|editor=Thil Mehl|page=10}}</ref> see [[Borough (Pennsylvania)]].\n\n==Geography==\nJacobus is located at {{coord|39|52|57|N|76|42|43|W|type:city}} (39.882516, -76.712068).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 445\n|1940= 552\n|1950= 706\n|1960= 968\n|1970= 1360\n|1980= 1396\n|1990= 1370\n|2000= 1203\n|2010= 1841\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 1,203 people, 481 households, and 379 families living in the borough.

The population was 1,841 at the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1837, Jacobus was originally called ''New Paradise.'' The name was later changed because of misdelivered mail between New Paradise and the town of [[Paradise, Pennsylvania]] in neighboring [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]].\n\nThe name ''Jacobus'' (j\u0103-K\u014c-b\u016ds) was derived from the name of the town's postmaster, Jacob Geiselman (1829-1909). To correct the problem of the misdelivered mail, the [[United States Post Office Department]] notified Geiselman to change the name of the post office. However, Geiselman was unable to think of another name. Therefore, the mail was sorted and forwarded to Geiselman labeled as,\"Jacob-US Mail;\" which was later shortened to \"Jacob-US.\"  The post office was then renamed Jacobus, and the town was renamed accordingly. In 1929, Jacobus became an incorporated Borough under Pennsylvania law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Commemorative Book|title=Commemorating the 150th year of the founding of the borough of Jacobus, York County, Pennsylvania, 1837-1987|year=1987|publisher=Mehl ad associates|location=York, Pennsylvania|editor=Thil Mehl|page=10}}</ref> see [[Borough (Pennsylvania)]].\n\n==Geography==\nJacobus is located at {{coord|39|52|57|N|76|42|43|W|type:city}} (39.882516, -76.712068).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 445\n|1940= 552\n|1950= 706\n|1960= 968\n|1970= 1360\n|1980= 1396\n|1990= 1370\n|2000= 1203\n|2010= 1841\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 1,203 people, 481 households, and 379 families living in the borough.

Under Article One, Congress is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Article One grants Congress various [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] and the ability to pass laws \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of Congress and the [[U.S. state|states]].\n\nArticle One's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the Vesting Clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes various rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out various other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the [[Vice President of the United States]] as the president of the Senate.\n\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the [[List of United States presidential vetoes|veto power]] of the [[President of the United States]]. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to [[Taxing and Spending Clause|lay and collect taxes and tariffs]] for the \"general welfare\" of the United States, the power to borrow money, the power to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate and international commerce]], the power to set [[United States nationality law|naturalization laws]], the power to coin and regulate money, the power to establish [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the power to raise and support military forces, and the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. Section 8 also provides Congress the power to establish a [[Washington, D.C.|federal district]] to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to various enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places various limits on the power of Congress, banning [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, [[Contract Clause|impairing contracts]], [[Import-Export Clause|taxing imports or exports]] above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress==\n{{main|Vesting Clauses}}\n[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|Opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] in the House of Representatives chamber, January 5, 2011]]\n{{quote|All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.}}\n\nSection 1 is a [[Vesting Clauses|vesting clause]] that bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|II]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|III]]. The former confers [[Executive (government)|executive]] power upon the President alone, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. This separation of powers, by which each department may exercise only its own constitutional powers and no others,<ref>''See Atkins v. United States'', 556 F.2d 1028, 1062 (Ct. Cl. 1977) (\"The purpose of the [Vesting C]lause is to locate the central source of legislative authority in Congress, rather than the Executive or the Judiciary.\"), ''abrogated on other grounds by [[INS v. Chadha]]'', 462 U.S. 919 (1983).</ref><ref>See ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States]]'', 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928) (\"Our Federal Constitution... divide[s] the governmental power into three branches. The first is the legislative, the second is the executive, and the third is judicial, and the rule is that in the actual administration of the government Congress... should exercise the legislative power, the President... the executive power, and the courts or the judiciary the judicial power....\")</ref> is fundamental to the idea of a limited government accountable to the people.\n\nThe separation of powers principle is particularly noteworthy in regard to the Congress. The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers \"herein granted\" within Article I (as later limited by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]).<ref>See ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', 514 U.S. 549, 592 (1995) (\"[Certain] comments of Hamilton and others about federal power reflected the well-known truth that the new Government would have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the Constitution.... Even before the passage of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], it was apparent that Congress would possess only those powers 'herein granted' by the rest of the Constitution.\").</ref> It also, by implied extension, prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the [[nondelegation doctrine]].<ref>See ''[[Touby v. the United States]]'', 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991) (\"From th[e language of this section of the Constitution] the Court has derived the nondelegation doctrine: that Congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government.\").</ref> However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have the latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an \"intelligible principle\" which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority.<ref>See ''J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co.'', 276 U.S. at 409 (\"If Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [administer a statutory scheme] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.\").</ref> That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Douglas H.|title=Essays on Article I: Legislative Vesting Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/2/legislative-vesting-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly,<ref>See ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'', 488 U.S. 361, 373 n.7 (1989) (nondelegation doctrine takes the form of \"giving narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be unconstitutional\").</ref> in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to \"test the waters\" of what the courts would allow it to do.<ref>''UAW v. Occupational Health & Safety Admin.'', 938 F.2d 1310, 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (\"In effect [the nondelegation doctrine as a principle of statutory interpretation is used by the courts to] require a clear statement by Congress that it intended to test the constitutional waters.\"); cf. ''[[Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council]]'', 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (\"[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.... This approach not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted, but also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it.\" (citing ''[[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop]]'', 440 U.S. 490, 499\u2013501, 504 (1979), and ''[[Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden]]'', 112 U.S. 261 (1884))); ''[[United States v. Bass]]'', 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971) (\"[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.\").</ref>\n\nAlthough not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation.<ref>''[[Barenblatt v. United States]]'', 360 U.S. 109, 111 (1959) (\"The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate.\"); e.g., 3 {{smallcaps|Annals of Congress}} 490\u201394 (1792) (House committee appointed to investigate the defeat of Gen. St. Clair by Indians empowered to \"call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.\").</ref> The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate.<ref>See ''[[McGrain v. Daugherty]]'', 273 U.S. 135, 174\u201375 (1927) (\"[T]he power of inquiry-with process to enforce it-is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. It was so regarded and employed in American Legislatures before the Constitution was framed and ratified.... A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information-which not infrequently is true-recourse must be had to others who do possess it. Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that period the power of inquiry, with enforcing process, was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate-indeed, was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is ample warrant for thinking... that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised.\").</ref> Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate.<ref name=\"investigate\">See ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'', 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957) (\"The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency or waste.\"); ''Barenblatt'', 360 U.S. at 111 (\"The scope of the power of inquiry... is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\").</ref> However, it is also ''limited'' to inquiries that are \"in aid of the legislative function;\"<ref>''[[Kilbourn v. Thompson]]'', 103 U.S. 168, 189 (1881).</ref> Congress may not \"expose for the sake of exposure.\"<ref>''Watkins'', 354 U.S. at 200.</ref> It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress's investigation power is the operations of the federal government, but Congress's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often-discussed and sometimes controversial (see [[executive privilege]]), although not often litigated. As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose (\"in aid of\" its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers.<ref>See ''McGrain'', 273 U.S. at 170 (\"[N]either house of Congress possesses a \u2018general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen\u2019;... the power actually possessed is limited to inquiries relating to matters of which the particular house \u2018has jurisdiction\u2019 and in respect of which it rightfully may take other action; [and] if the inquiry relates to \u2018a matter wherein relief or redress could be had only by a judicial proceeding\u2019 it is not within the range of this power, but must be left to the courts, conformably to the constitutional separation of governmental powers....\" (quoting ''Kilbourne'', 103 U.S. at 193)); see also ''Sinclair v. United States'', 279 U.S. 263, 295 (1929) (\"Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits....\"), overruled on other grounds by ''United States v. Gaudin'', 515 U.S. 506 (1995).</ref> The courts are highly deferential to Congress's exercise of its investigation powers, however. Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate,<ref name=\"investigate\"/> and the courts have interpreted Congress's regulatory powers broadly since the [[Great Depression]].\n\n=={{anchor|Section 2}}Section 2: House of Representatives==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Composition and election of Members===\n{{quote|The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.}}\n\nSection Two provides for the election of the House of Representatives every second year. Since Representatives are to be \"chosen... by the People,\" State Governors are not allowed to appoint temporary replacements when vacancies occur in a state's delegation to the House of Representatives; instead, the Governor of the state is required by [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 2, Clause 4: Vacancies|clause 4]] to issue a [[writ of election]] calling a special election to fill the vacancy.\n\nAt the time of its creation, the Constitution did not explicitly give citizens an inherent right to vote.<ref>''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'', 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 178 (1875) (\"[T]he Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one....\").</ref>  However, by stipulating that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state's legislature could vote in Congressional (House of Representatives) elections the Framers expressed a rather explicit intent that the House was to be directly elected.  Since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curbed the states' broad powers to set voter qualification standards.  Though never enforced, clause 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives|Fourteenth Amendment]] provides that \"when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\" The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex.  The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits the revocation of voting rights due to the non-payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]].  The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right of US citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to vote on account of age.\n\nMoreover, since the Supreme Court has recognized voting as a fundamental right,<ref>See ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533, 561\u201362 (1964) (\"Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society.\"); ''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886) (\"[Voting] is regarded as a fundamental political right, because preservative of all rights.\").</ref> the [[Equal Protection Clause]] places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; it is fair to say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.<ref>See '[[Kramer v.

To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a [[United States Census|census]] be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e. [[slave]]s), but excluding non-taxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This Constitutional rule, known as the [[three-fifths compromise]], was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for [[enumeration]] purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] (writing in [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|1833]]), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2:\u00a7\u00a7 630\u201335, 641\u201347, 673\u201380|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_2_3s22.html|website=The Founder's Constitution|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=Volume 2, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, Document 22|page=\u00a7677|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<ref name=prigg>Cf.

To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income \"from whatever source derived\" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Vacancies===\n{{quote|When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.}}\n\nSection two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement, but the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling.

Article Five provides that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Thus, no individual state may have its individual representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent. That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\n\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their [[Equal footing|equality]] in the Senate would, according to [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] (in ''[[Texas v. White]]''), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the [[District of Columbia]] full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the States are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right.

This was done in May 1789 [[Sortition|by lot]]. It was also decided that each state's Senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\n\nAs originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators===\n{{quote|No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.}}\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial.<ref>See ''Nixon'', 506 U.S. at 230\u201331, 233\u201336 (holding that the Senate's sole power to try impeachments made its judgment conclusive as to what constituted an adequate impeachment trial) (\"We think that the word 'sole' is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' \"''sole'' Power of Impeachment.\" The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted. The dictionary definition bears this out.... The history and contemporary understanding of the impeachment provisions support our reading of the constitutional language.... [T]he Judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments.... [J]udicial review would be inconsistent with the Framers' insistence that our system be one of checks and balances.... Judicial involvement in impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of judicial review, is counterintuitive because it would eviscerate the 'important constitutional check' placed on the Judiciary by the Framers.

In addition to the textual commitment argument,... the lack of finality and the difficulty of fashioning relief counsel against justiciability....

On one occasion (in the case of Senator [[William Blount]] in 1797) the Senate declined to hold a trial, asserting that the House had no jurisdiction over members of the Senate; in any case, Blount had already been expelled from the Senate.<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/impeach.html Impeachment History].

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe constitution's framers vested the Senate with this power for several reasons. First, they believed Senators would be better educated, more virtuous, and more high-minded than Members of the House of Representatives and thus uniquely able to decide responsibly the most difficult of political questions. Second, they believed that the Senate, being a numerous body, would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an impeachment trial, in which it, unlike judges and the judiciary system, would \"never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutor, or in the construction of it by judges, as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.\" (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 65).<ref name=Gerhardt>{{cite web|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Michael J.|title=Essay on Trial of Impeachment|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three Constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials.  The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion.  The stipulation that the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the President and Vice President it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.<ref name=Gerhardt/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction===\n{{quote|Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.}}\n\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future.

First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government, not with the executive or judicial.<ref name=APessay>{{cite web|last1=Peacock|first1=Anthony|title=Essays on Article I: Election Regulations|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/19/election-regulations|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>See ''[[Foster v.

Thus it is well settled that the Elections Clause grants Congress 'the power to override state regulations' by establishing uniform rules for federal elections, binding on the States. '[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.' The Clause gives Congress 'comprehensive' authority to regulate the details of elections, including the power to impose 'the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved.' Congressional authority extends not only to general elections, but also to any 'primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress.') (citations omitted); ''United States v. Manning'', 215 F. Supp. 272, 284 (W.D. La. 1963) (\"\u2018[T]he manner of holding elections'... must be read as referring to the entire electoral process, from the first step of registering to the last step, the State's promulgation of honest returns.\").</ref> As authorized by this clause, Congress has set a [[Election Day (United States)|uniform date]] for federal elections: the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.<ref>{{USC|2|7}} (2006) (prescribing \"Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November\" as the date for electing Representatives); id. \u00a7 1 (elections for Senators to be held on same date as elections for Representatives); see also {{USC|3|1}} (2006) (prescribing \"Tuesday next after the first Monday in November\" as the date for electing presidential Electors).</ref>\n\nPresently, as there are no on-point federal regulations, the states retain the authority to regulate the dates on which other aspects of the election process are held (registration, primary elections, etc.) and where elections will be held. As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\"<ref>''[[Cook v.

Although in theory Congress could draw the district map for each State,<ref>See ''[[Vieth v. Jubelirer]]'', 541 U.S. 267, 275 (2004) (plurality opinion) (\"Article I, \u00a7 4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districts for federal elections, permitted Congress to 'make or alter' those districts if it wished.\").</ref> it has not exercised this level of oversight. Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<ref>{{USC|2|2c}} (2006).</ref> The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include voters using the [[Direct democracy|initiative process]], in those states whose constitutions provide it, to create an independent [[redistricting commission]].<ref>''See [[Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission]]'' (576 U.S. __)</ref>\n\nCongress first exercised its power to regulate elections nation-wide in 1842, when the [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] passed a law requiring the election of Representatives by districts.<ref>{{usstat|5|491}}</ref> In subsequent years, Congress expanded on the requirements, successively adding contiguity, compactness, and substantial equality of population to the districting requirements. These standards were all later deleted in the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]].<ref name=USC-A&I>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation, Centennial Edition, Interim Edition: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 26, 2013|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2013/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2013.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=April 13, 2014|location=Washington, DC|pages=127\u2013128|year=2013}}</ref> Congress subsequently reinstated the requirement that districts be composed of contiguous territory, be \"compact,\" and have equal populations within each State.<ref>{{USC|2|3}} (1934) (\"In each State entitled under this apportionment to more than one Representative,...

Broom]]'', 287 U.S. 1 (1932).</ref> but the Supreme Court has re-imposed the population requirement on the States under the Equal Protection Clause<ref name=\"wesberry\"/> and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other \"traditional\" districting criteria of compactness and contiguity.<ref>See, e.g., ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'', 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993) (\"[L]egislation that is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification,\" is subject to strict scrutiny.).</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress legislated a remedy for a situation under which deadlocks in state legislatures over the election of Senators were creating vacancies in the office. The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s]] guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]], and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.<ref name=USC-A&I/>\n\nBeginning with the [[Tillman Act of 1907]], Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|elections and campaign financing]]. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976), which, in the face of a First Amendment challenge, set the ground rules for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.<ref name=APessay/>\n\nIn addition to statutory constraints, Congress and the States have altered the electoral process through amending the Constitution (first in the above mentioned Fifteenth Amendment). The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the [[suffrage|right to vote]] on the basis of sex; the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax; and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 4, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Sessions of Congress===\n{{quote|The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.}}\n\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress|Article II, Section 3]] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. [[Nathaniel Gorham]] of [[Massachusetts]] argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article I: Meetings of Congress Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/20/meetings-of-congress-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\". This change virtually eliminated the necessity of there being a lame duck session of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 5}}Section 5: Procedure==\n<!-- [[United States v.

In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a [[quorum call]], requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic.\n\nSometimes, unqualified individuals have been admitted to Congress. For instance, the Senate once admitted [[John Eaton (politician)|John Henry Eaton]], a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time). In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, [[Rush D. Holt Sr.|Rush Holt]], was elected to the Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath.

The latter was affirmed when [[Mike Gravel]] published over 4,000 pages of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in ''[[Gravel v.

This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using [[patronage]] to buy votes in Congress.<ref name=\"Calabresi\" /> It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nFurthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the [[Saxbe fix]]). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator [[Hugo Black]] was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 7}}Section 7: Bills==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Bills of revenue===\n{{main|Origination Clause|l1=Bills of Revenue}}\n{{quote|All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.}}\nThis establishes the method for making [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that involve taxation.

If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.}}\nThis clause is known as the [[Presentment Clause]]. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the [[veto]], although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"[[pocket veto]]\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"<ref>See Ross Wilson, A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1593862</ref>\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In ''[[Wright v. United States]]'' (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Presidential veto===\n{{quote|Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.}}\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996|Line Item Veto Act]], which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].\n\nSome Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. [[Grover Cleveland]], for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including [[pocket veto]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/BushGW.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt; Statistics &amp; Lists &gt; Vetoes by President George W.

Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American [[welfare state#United States|welfare state]] as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. [[James Madison]], who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution.  While he was President of the United States, Madison [[veto]]ed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to [[Internal improvements|build infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Madison - Veto of federal public works bill of March 3, 1817|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105014440/http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2018|accessdate= November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |title=Excerpt from James Madison\u2019s Veto Message: March 3, 1817 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430011150/https://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf Presidential Vetoes, 1789\u20131988, p. 34]</ref>\n\n===Clause 1: the General Welfare Clause===\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title= |url=https://constitutionallawreporter.com/taxing-and-spending-clause/|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the [[political question]] to Congress. In ''[[United States v. Butler]]'' (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]; for instance, the [[social security]] program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\n===Clause 2: Borrowing Power===\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding ''[[Knox v. Lee]],'' the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.<ref>See ''e.g.'' Perry v. United States, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137 294 U.S. 330 (1935).]</ref>\n\n===Clause 3: Commerce Clause===\n[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.]]\n{{Main|Commerce Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;}}\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the ''[[commerce clause]]'' for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: [[Thomas Gibbons (politician)|Thomas Gibbons]] had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the [[Hudson River]], while the other, [[Aaron Ogden]], had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitude dominated the Court. In ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Company]]'' (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled [[New Deal]] programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company]]'', that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"[[unfair labor practice]]s\" such as firing workers for joining [[labor union|unions]]. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', the Court ruled that production quotas under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of [[handgun]]s, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by ''Wickard v. Filburn''. In ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] even where states approve its use for [[medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]]. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\n===Clause 18: Implied Powers of Congress===\n====Other powers of Congress====\n[[File:USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) underway in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2 November 1964.jpg|thumb| alt=Aircraft carrier at sea.|Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']].]]\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to [[naturalization]] and [[bankruptcy]]. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish [[Postal Clause|post offices and post roads]] (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting [[United States copyright law|copyrights]] and [[United States patent law|patents]] of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the [[Copyright Clause]], is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<ref>[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]] (1996). The fire of invention, the fuel of interest: On intellectual property. Washington D.C.: The American Enterprise Institute Press.</ref> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the [[War Powers Clause]], only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against [[Pancho Villa]] constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] and [[reprisal]]. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the [[Feres v. United States|Feres Doctrine]].\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\n====Necessary and Proper====\n{{Main|Necessary and Proper Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.}}\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in ''Wickard v. Filburn''; however, [[Thomas Jefferson]], in the [[Kentucky Resolutions]], supported by [[James Madison]], maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[piracy]] and [[felony]] on the [[high seas]], and offenses against the [[law of nations]].\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), which involved the establishment of a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing ''all'' of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as [[implied powers]]) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 9}}Section 9: Limits on Congress==\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\n{{quote|The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of ''[[wiktionary:habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nNo [[Bill of attainder]] or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\nNo [[Poll tax|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\n\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\n\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, [[wiktionary:emolument#Noun|Emolument]], Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.}}\n\n===Clause 1: Slave trade===\n[[File:Africa and the American Flag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|U.S. brig ''[[USS Perry (1843)|Perry]]'' confronting the slave ship ''Martha'' off [[Ambriz]] on June 6, 1850]]\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[slave trade|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808.  Congress could however, levy a ''[[per capita]]'' duty of up to ten [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollars]] for each slave imported into the country.  This clause was further [[entrenched clause#United States|entrenched]] into the Constitution by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.  On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the United States, which went into effect January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution.\n\n===Clauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections===\nA writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA [[bill of attainder]] is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An ''[[ex post facto]]'' law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The ''ex post facto'' clause does not apply to civil matters.<ref>[[Calder v. Bull]], 3 U.S. 386, 399-400 (1798).</ref>\n\n===Clauses 4-7: Apportionment of direct taxes===\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from [[#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Section Two, Clause 3]] that [[direct taxes]] must be apportioned by state populations.  This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].  In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] exempted all [[income taxes]] from this clause. This overcame the ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]]s authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\n===Clause 8: Titles of nobility===\n{{main|Title of Nobility Clause}}\nThe [[Title of Nobility Clause]] prohibits Congress from granting any [[nobility|title of nobility]]. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state.  Emoluments were a profound concern of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|the Founders]].<ref name=impeachable-offenses>{{cite magazine|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah|authorlink1=Noah Feldman|last2=Weisberg|first2=Jacob|authorlink2=Jacob Weisberg|title=What Are Impeachable Offenses?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/donald-trump-impeachable-offenses|magazine=The New York Review of Books|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 10}}Section 10: Limits on the States==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Contract Clause===\n{{main|Contract Clause}}\n\n{{quote|No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit [[Bills of Credit]]; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.}}\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue [[bills of credit]] (such as currency).

Retrieved January 23, 2011.</ref>) of any type or form of [[money]] to meet any financial obligation,<ref>''\"Any\"'' financial obligation would ''de facto'' include financial obligations owed either ''by'' or ''to'' the state; see [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/any?show=0&t=1295805841 definition of ''\"any\"'' as noun (5), in Merriam-Webster]</ref> unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in ''Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank''<ref>262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923). See also ''[[Gwin v. Breedlove]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844); and ''[[Griffin v. Thompson]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844).</ref>). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist no. 44]]'', Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\".<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s5.html Madison, James ''Federalist Papers No. 44'']</ref> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ''ex post facto'' laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Contract Clause]] was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' was decided. The case involved the [[Yazoo land scandal]], in which the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature<!--which was basically all of them-->. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' involved [[Dartmouth College]], which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, [[New Hampshire]] passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]''. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In ''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws ''could'' apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal bankruptcy law]] in 1898.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Import-Export Clause===\n{{main|Import-Export Clause}}\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's{{sic}}<!-- Please do not remove the apostrophe in \"it's\".

States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress).

Furthermore, states may not engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a [[Militia (United States)|militia]] according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose members are also members of the militia as defined by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in a [[state defense force]] with federal oversight under {{UnitedStatesCode|32|109}}.\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to [[the Crown]] for approval. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an [[interstate compact]].  In ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".<ref>{{cite book |title=American Constitutional Law|last=Tribe |first=Laurence | authorlink=Laurence Tribe |year=2000 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=1-56662-714-1 |pages=649\u201351}}</ref> The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet [[Coming into force|effective]] [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] entered into by fifteen states plus the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=Michael|title=Circumventing the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Survives Constitutional Scrutiny Under the Compact Clause|journal=Legislation and Policy Brief|date=February 17, 2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40ff|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=lpb|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ American University Washington College of Law}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Peter H.

Under Article One, Congress is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Article One grants Congress various [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] and the ability to pass laws \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of Congress and the [[U.S. state|states]].\n\nArticle One's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the Vesting Clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes various rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out various other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the [[Vice President of the United States]] as the president of the Senate.\n\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the [[List of United States presidential vetoes|veto power]] of the [[President of the United States]]. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to [[Taxing and Spending Clause|lay and collect taxes and tariffs]] for the \"general welfare\" of the United States, the power to borrow money, the power to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate and international commerce]], the power to set [[United States nationality law|naturalization laws]], the power to coin and regulate money, the power to establish [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the power to raise and support military forces, and the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. Section 8 also provides Congress the power to establish a [[Washington, D.C.|federal district]] to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to various enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places various limits on the power of Congress, banning [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, [[Contract Clause|impairing contracts]], [[Import-Export Clause|taxing imports or exports]] above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress==\n{{main|Vesting Clauses}}\n[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|Opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] in the House of Representatives chamber, January 5, 2011]]\n{{quote|All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.}}\n\nSection 1 is a [[Vesting Clauses|vesting clause]] that bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|II]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|III]]. The former confers [[Executive (government)|executive]] power upon the President alone, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. This separation of powers, by which each department may exercise only its own constitutional powers and no others,<ref>''See Atkins v. United States'', 556 F.2d 1028, 1062 (Ct. Cl. 1977) (\"The purpose of the [Vesting C]lause is to locate the central source of legislative authority in Congress, rather than the Executive or the Judiciary.\"), ''abrogated on other grounds by [[INS v. Chadha]]'', 462 U.S. 919 (1983).</ref><ref>See ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States]]'', 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928) (\"Our Federal Constitution... divide[s] the governmental power into three branches. The first is the legislative, the second is the executive, and the third is judicial, and the rule is that in the actual administration of the government Congress... should exercise the legislative power, the President... the executive power, and the courts or the judiciary the judicial power....\")</ref> is fundamental to the idea of a limited government accountable to the people.\n\nThe separation of powers principle is particularly noteworthy in regard to the Congress. The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers \"herein granted\" within Article I (as later limited by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]).<ref>See ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', 514 U.S. 549, 592 (1995) (\"[Certain] comments of Hamilton and others about federal power reflected the well-known truth that the new Government would have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the Constitution.... Even before the passage of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], it was apparent that Congress would possess only those powers 'herein granted' by the rest of the Constitution.\").</ref> It also, by implied extension, prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the [[nondelegation doctrine]].<ref>See ''[[Touby v. the United States]]'', 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991) (\"From th[e language of this section of the Constitution] the Court has derived the nondelegation doctrine: that Congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government.\").</ref> However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have the latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an \"intelligible principle\" which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority.<ref>See ''J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co.'', 276 U.S. at 409 (\"If Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [administer a statutory scheme] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.\").</ref> That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Douglas H.|title=Essays on Article I: Legislative Vesting Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/2/legislative-vesting-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly,<ref>See ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'', 488 U.S. 361, 373 n.7 (1989) (nondelegation doctrine takes the form of \"giving narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be unconstitutional\").</ref> in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to \"test the waters\" of what the courts would allow it to do.<ref>''UAW v. Occupational Health & Safety Admin.'', 938 F.2d 1310, 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (\"In effect [the nondelegation doctrine as a principle of statutory interpretation is used by the courts to] require a clear statement by Congress that it intended to test the constitutional waters.\"); cf. ''[[Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council]]'', 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (\"[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.... This approach not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted, but also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it.\" (citing ''[[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop]]'', 440 U.S. 490, 499\u2013501, 504 (1979), and ''[[Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden]]'', 112 U.S. 261 (1884))); ''[[United States v. Bass]]'', 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971) (\"[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.\").</ref>\n\nAlthough not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation.<ref>''[[Barenblatt v. United States]]'', 360 U.S. 109, 111 (1959) (\"The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate.\"); e.g., 3 {{smallcaps|Annals of Congress}} 490\u201394 (1792) (House committee appointed to investigate the defeat of Gen. St. Clair by Indians empowered to \"call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.\").</ref> The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate.<ref>See ''[[McGrain v. Daugherty]]'', 273 U.S. 135, 174\u201375 (1927) (\"[T]he power of inquiry-with process to enforce it-is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. It was so regarded and employed in American Legislatures before the Constitution was framed and ratified.... A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information-which not infrequently is true-recourse must be had to others who do possess it. Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that period the power of inquiry, with enforcing process, was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate-indeed, was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is ample warrant for thinking... that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised.\").</ref> Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate.<ref name=\"investigate\">See ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'', 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957) (\"The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency or waste.\"); ''Barenblatt'', 360 U.S. at 111 (\"The scope of the power of inquiry... is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\").</ref> However, it is also ''limited'' to inquiries that are \"in aid of the legislative function;\"<ref>''[[Kilbourn v. Thompson]]'', 103 U.S. 168, 189 (1881).</ref> Congress may not \"expose for the sake of exposure.\"<ref>''Watkins'', 354 U.S. at 200.</ref> It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress's investigation power is the operations of the federal government, but Congress's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often-discussed and sometimes controversial (see [[executive privilege]]), although not often litigated. As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose (\"in aid of\" its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers.<ref>See ''McGrain'', 273 U.S. at 170 (\"[N]either house of Congress possesses a \u2018general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen\u2019;... the power actually possessed is limited to inquiries relating to matters of which the particular house \u2018has jurisdiction\u2019 and in respect of which it rightfully may take other action; [and] if the inquiry relates to \u2018a matter wherein relief or redress could be had only by a judicial proceeding\u2019 it is not within the range of this power, but must be left to the courts, conformably to the constitutional separation of governmental powers....\" (quoting ''Kilbourne'', 103 U.S. at 193)); see also ''Sinclair v. United States'', 279 U.S. 263, 295 (1929) (\"Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits....\"), overruled on other grounds by ''United States v. Gaudin'', 515 U.S. 506 (1995).</ref> The courts are highly deferential to Congress's exercise of its investigation powers, however. Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate,<ref name=\"investigate\"/> and the courts have interpreted Congress's regulatory powers broadly since the [[Great Depression]].\n\n=={{anchor|Section 2}}Section 2: House of Representatives==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Composition and election of Members===\n{{quote|The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.}}\n\nSection Two provides for the election of the House of Representatives every second year. Since Representatives are to be \"chosen... by the People,\" State Governors are not allowed to appoint temporary replacements when vacancies occur in a state's delegation to the House of Representatives; instead, the Governor of the state is required by [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 2, Clause 4: Vacancies|clause 4]] to issue a [[writ of election]] calling a special election to fill the vacancy.\n\nAt the time of its creation, the Constitution did not explicitly give citizens an inherent right to vote.<ref>''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'', 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 178 (1875) (\"[T]he Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one....\").</ref>  However, by stipulating that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state's legislature could vote in Congressional (House of Representatives) elections the Framers expressed a rather explicit intent that the House was to be directly elected.  Since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curbed the states' broad powers to set voter qualification standards.  Though never enforced, clause 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives|Fourteenth Amendment]] provides that \"when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\" The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex.  The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits the revocation of voting rights due to the non-payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]].  The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right of US citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to vote on account of age.\n\nMoreover, since the Supreme Court has recognized voting as a fundamental right,<ref>See ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533, 561\u201362 (1964) (\"Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society.\"); ''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886) (\"[Voting] is regarded as a fundamental political right, because preservative of all rights.\").</ref> the [[Equal Protection Clause]] places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; it is fair to say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.<ref>See '[[Kramer v.

Statutes granting the franchise to residents on a selective basis always pose the danger of denying some citizens any effective voice in the governmental affairs which substantially affect their lives.\") (emphasis added).</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the Supreme Court started to view voting as a fundamental right covered by the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref name=Briffault>{{cite journal | title=The Contested Right to Vote | author=Briffault, Richard | journal=Michigan Law Review | year=2002 | volume=100 | pages=1521\u20131522}}</ref>  In a dissenting opinion of a 1964 Supreme Court case involving [[reapportionment]] in the [[Alabama]] state legislature, Associate Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] included ''Minor'' in a list of past decisions about voting and apportionment which were no longer being followed.<ref>''[[Reynolds v.

However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the provision of Clause One that Representatives shall be elected \"by the People\" to mean that, in those states with more than one member of the House of Representatives, each congressional election district within the state must have nearly identical populations.<ref name=wesberry>''[[Wesberry v.

To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a [[United States Census|census]] be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e. [[slave]]s), but excluding non-taxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This Constitutional rule, known as the [[three-fifths compromise]], was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for [[enumeration]] purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] (writing in [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|1833]]), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2:\u00a7\u00a7 630\u201335, 641\u201347, 673\u201380|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_2_3s22.html|website=The Founder's Constitution|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=Volume 2, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, Document 22|page=\u00a7677|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<ref name=prigg>Cf.

Thus, for example, although the constitution has declared, that representatives shall be apportioned among the states according to their respective federal numbers; and for this purpose, it has expressly authorized congress, by law, to provide for an enumeration of the population every ten years; yet the power to apportion representatives, after this enumeration is made, is nowhere found among the express powers given to congress, but it has always been acted upon, as irresistibly flowing from the duty positively enjoined by the constitution.\").</ref> and to allocate a particular number of representatives to each state according to its share of the national population.\n\nSince enactment of the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]], a constant 435 House seats have been apportioned among the states according to each census, and determining the size of the House is not presently part of the apportionment process. With one exception, the apportionment of 1842, the House of Representatives had been enlarged by various degrees from sixty-five members in 1788 to 435 members by 1913.  The determination of size was made based on the aggregate national population, so long as the size of the House did not exceed 1 member for every 30,000 of the country's total population<ref>See ''Whelan v. Cuomo'', 415 F. Supp. 251, 256 (E.D.N.Y. 1976) (\"The historical record of the Constitutional Convention supports several conclusions[,]...

Even so, the constraint placed upon Congress's taxation power remained, as the restriction was reiterated in Article 1 Section 9 Clause 4. The amount of [[direct taxes]] that could be collected by the federal government from the people in any State would still be tied directly to that state's share of the national population.\n\nDue to this restriction, application of the [[income tax]] to income derived from real estate and specifically income in the form of dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states;<ref>''[[Pollock v.

To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income \"from whatever source derived\" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Vacancies===\n{{quote|When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.}}\n\nSection two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement, but the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling.

It ends by temporarily [[Entrenched clause#United States|shielding]] three Article I clauses from being amended. This clause is among them. (The others are first and fourth clauses in Section 9.) Article Five provides that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Thus, no individual state may have its individual representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent. That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\n\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their [[Equal footing|equality]] in the Senate would, according to [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] (in ''[[Texas v. White]]''), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the [[District of Columbia]] full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the States are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right.

This was done in May 1789 [[Sortition|by lot]]. It was also decided that each state's Senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\n\nAs originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators===\n{{quote|No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.}}\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial.<ref>See ''Nixon'', 506 U.S. at 230\u201331, 233\u201336 (holding that the Senate's sole power to try impeachments made its judgment conclusive as to what constituted an adequate impeachment trial) (\"We think that the word 'sole' is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' \"''sole'' Power of Impeachment.\" The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted. The dictionary definition bears this out.... The history and contemporary understanding of the impeachment provisions support our reading of the constitutional language.... [T]he Judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments.... [J]udicial review would be inconsistent with the Framers' insistence that our system be one of checks and balances.... Judicial involvement in impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of judicial review, is counterintuitive because it would eviscerate the 'important constitutional check' placed on the Judiciary by the Framers. [It would be an improper reading of the Constitution to] place final reviewing authority with respect to impeachments in the hands of the same body that the impeachment process is meant to regulate.... In addition to the textual commitment argument,... the lack of finality and the difficulty of fashioning relief counsel against justiciability....

On one occasion (in the case of Senator [[William Blount]] in 1797) the Senate declined to hold a trial, asserting that the House had no jurisdiction over members of the Senate; in any case, Blount had already been expelled from the Senate.<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/impeach.html Impeachment History].

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe constitution's framers vested the Senate with this power for several reasons. First, they believed Senators would be better educated, more virtuous, and more high-minded than Members of the House of Representatives and thus uniquely able to decide responsibly the most difficult of political questions. Second, they believed that the Senate, being a numerous body, would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an impeachment trial, in which it, unlike judges and the judiciary system, would \"never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutor, or in the construction of it by judges, as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.\" (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 65).<ref name=Gerhardt>{{cite web|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Michael J.|title=Essay on Trial of Impeachment|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three Constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials.  The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion.  The stipulation that the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the President and Vice President it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.<ref name=Gerhardt/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction===\n{{quote|Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.}}\n\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future.

First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government, not with the executive or judicial.<ref name=APessay>{{cite web|last1=Peacock|first1=Anthony|title=Essays on Article I: Election Regulations|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/19/election-regulations|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>See ''[[Foster v.

Thus it is well settled that the Elections Clause grants Congress 'the power to override state regulations' by establishing uniform rules for federal elections, binding on the States. '[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.' The Clause gives Congress 'comprehensive' authority to regulate the details of elections, including the power to impose 'the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved.' Congressional authority extends not only to general elections, but also to any 'primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress.') (citations omitted); ''United States v. Manning'', 215 F. Supp. 272, 284 (W.D.

As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\"<ref>''[[Cook v. Gralike]]'', 531 U.S. 510, 523\u201324 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</ref> The Supreme Court has held that States may ''not'' exercise their power to determine the \"manner\" of holding elections to impose term limits on their congressional delegation.<ref name=thornton/>\n\nOne of the most significant ways that each state regulates the \"manner\" of elections is through their power to draw electoral districts. Although in theory Congress could draw the district map for each State,<ref>See ''[[Vieth v.

Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<ref>{{USC|2|2c}} (2006).</ref> The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include voters using the [[Direct democracy|initiative process]], in those states whose constitutions provide it, to create an independent [[redistricting commission]].<ref>''See [[Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission]]'' (576 U.S. __)</ref>\n\nCongress first exercised its power to regulate elections nation-wide in 1842, when the [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] passed a law requiring the election of Representatives by districts.<ref>{{usstat|5|491}}</ref> In subsequent years, Congress expanded on the requirements, successively adding contiguity, compactness, and substantial equality of population to the districting requirements. These standards were all later deleted in the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]].<ref name=USC-A&I>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation, Centennial Edition, Interim Edition: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 26, 2013|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2013/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2013.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=April 13, 2014|location=Washington, DC|pages=127\u2013128|year=2013}}</ref> Congress subsequently reinstated the requirement that districts be composed of contiguous territory, be \"compact,\" and have equal populations within each State.<ref>{{USC|2|3}} (1934) (\"In each State entitled under this apportionment to more than one Representative,... [such Representatives] shall be elected by districts composed of a contiguous and compact territory, and containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants.\").</ref> Congress has allowed those requirements to lapse,<ref>See ''[[Wood v. Broom]]'', 287 U.S. 1 (1932).</ref> but the Supreme Court has re-imposed the population requirement on the States under the Equal Protection Clause<ref name=\"wesberry\"/> and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other \"traditional\" districting criteria of compactness and contiguity.<ref>See, e.g., ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'', 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993) (\"[L]egislation that is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification,\" is subject to strict scrutiny.).</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress legislated a remedy for a situation under which deadlocks in state legislatures over the election of Senators were creating vacancies in the office. The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s]] guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]], and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.<ref name=USC-A&I/>\n\nBeginning with the [[Tillman Act of 1907]], Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|elections and campaign financing]]. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976), which, in the face of a First Amendment challenge, set the ground rules for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.<ref name=APessay/>\n\nIn addition to statutory constraints, Congress and the States have altered the electoral process through amending the Constitution (first in the above mentioned Fifteenth Amendment). The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the [[suffrage|right to vote]] on the basis of sex; the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax; and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 4, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Sessions of Congress===\n{{quote|The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.}}\n\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress|Article II, Section 3]] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. [[Nathaniel Gorham]] of [[Massachusetts]] argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article I: Meetings of Congress Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/20/meetings-of-congress-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\". This change virtually eliminated the necessity of there being a lame duck session of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 5}}Section 5: Procedure==\n<!-- [[United States v.

In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a [[quorum call]], requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic.\n\nSometimes, unqualified individuals have been admitted to Congress. For instance, the Senate once admitted [[John Eaton (politician)|John Henry Eaton]], a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time). In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, [[Rush D. Holt Sr.|Rush Holt]], was elected to the Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath.

The latter was affirmed when [[Mike Gravel]] published over 4,000 pages of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in ''[[Gravel v.

This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using [[patronage]] to buy votes in Congress.<ref name=\"Calabresi\" /> It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nFurthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the [[Saxbe fix]]). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator [[Hugo Black]] was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 7}}Section 7: Bills==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Bills of revenue===\n{{main|Origination Clause|l1=Bills of Revenue}}\n{{quote|All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.}}\nThis establishes the method for making [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that involve taxation.

The clause was part of the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] between small and large states; the large states were unhappy with the lopsided power of small states in the Senate, and so the clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, and compensates the large states for allowing equal voting rights to Senators from small states.<ref>Jensen, Erik and Monaghan, Henry.

Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the [[veto]], although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"[[pocket veto]]\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"<ref>See Ross Wilson, A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1593862</ref>\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In ''[[Wright v. United States]]'' (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Presidential veto===\n{{quote|Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.}}\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996|Line Item Veto Act]], which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].\n\nSome Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. [[Grover Cleveland]], for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including [[pocket veto]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/BushGW.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt; Statistics &amp; Lists &gt; Vetoes by President George W.

Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American [[welfare state#United States|welfare state]] as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. [[James Madison]], who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution.  While he was President of the United States, Madison [[veto]]ed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to [[Internal improvements|build infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Madison - Veto of federal public works bill of March 3, 1817|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105014440/http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2018|accessdate= November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |title=Excerpt from James Madison\u2019s Veto Message: March 3, 1817 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430011150/https://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf Presidential Vetoes, 1789\u20131988, p. 34]</ref>\n\n===Clause 1: the General Welfare Clause===\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title= |url=https://constitutionallawreporter.com/taxing-and-spending-clause/|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the [[political question]] to Congress. In ''[[United States v. Butler]]'' (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]; for instance, the [[social security]] program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\n===Clause 2: Borrowing Power===\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding ''[[Knox v. Lee]],'' the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.<ref>See ''e.g.'' Perry v. United States, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137 294 U.S. 330 (1935).]</ref>\n\n===Clause 3: Commerce Clause===\n[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.]]\n{{Main|Commerce Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;}}\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the ''[[commerce clause]]'' for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: [[Thomas Gibbons (politician)|Thomas Gibbons]] had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the [[Hudson River]], while the other, [[Aaron Ogden]], had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitude dominated the Court. In ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Company]]'' (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled [[New Deal]] programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company]]'', that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"[[unfair labor practice]]s\" such as firing workers for joining [[labor union|unions]]. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', the Court ruled that production quotas under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of [[handgun]]s, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by ''Wickard v. Filburn''. In ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] even where states approve its use for [[medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]]. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\n===Clause 18: Implied Powers of Congress===\n====Other powers of Congress====\n[[File:USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) underway in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2 November 1964.jpg|thumb| alt=Aircraft carrier at sea.|Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']].]]\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to [[naturalization]] and [[bankruptcy]]. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish [[Postal Clause|post offices and post roads]] (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting [[United States copyright law|copyrights]] and [[United States patent law|patents]] of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the [[Copyright Clause]], is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<ref>[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]] (1996). The fire of invention, the fuel of interest: On intellectual property. Washington D.C.: The American Enterprise Institute Press.</ref> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the [[War Powers Clause]], only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against [[Pancho Villa]] constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] and [[reprisal]]. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the [[Feres v. United States|Feres Doctrine]].\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\n====Necessary and Proper====\n{{Main|Necessary and Proper Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.}}\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in ''Wickard v. Filburn''; however, [[Thomas Jefferson]], in the [[Kentucky Resolutions]], supported by [[James Madison]], maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[piracy]] and [[felony]] on the [[high seas]], and offenses against the [[law of nations]].\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), which involved the establishment of a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing ''all'' of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as [[implied powers]]) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 9}}Section 9: Limits on Congress==\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\n{{quote|The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of ''[[wiktionary:habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nNo [[Bill of attainder]] or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\nNo [[Poll tax|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\n\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\n\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, [[wiktionary:emolument#Noun|Emolument]], Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.}}\n\n===Clause 1: Slave trade===\n[[File:Africa and the American Flag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|U.S. brig ''[[USS Perry (1843)|Perry]]'' confronting the slave ship ''Martha'' off [[Ambriz]] on June 6, 1850]]\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[slave trade|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808.  Congress could however, levy a ''[[per capita]]'' duty of up to ten [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollars]] for each slave imported into the country.  This clause was further [[entrenched clause#United States|entrenched]] into the Constitution by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.  On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the United States, which went into effect January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution.\n\n===Clauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections===\nA writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA [[bill of attainder]] is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An ''[[ex post facto]]'' law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The ''ex post facto'' clause does not apply to civil matters.<ref>[[Calder v. Bull]], 3 U.S. 386, 399-400 (1798).</ref>\n\n===Clauses 4-7: Apportionment of direct taxes===\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from [[#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Section Two, Clause 3]] that [[direct taxes]] must be apportioned by state populations.  This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].  In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] exempted all [[income taxes]] from this clause. This overcame the ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]]s authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\n===Clause 8: Titles of nobility===\n{{main|Title of Nobility Clause}}\nThe [[Title of Nobility Clause]] prohibits Congress from granting any [[nobility|title of nobility]]. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state.  Emoluments were a profound concern of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|the Founders]].<ref name=impeachable-offenses>{{cite magazine|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah|authorlink1=Noah Feldman|last2=Weisberg|first2=Jacob|authorlink2=Jacob Weisberg|title=What Are Impeachable Offenses?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/donald-trump-impeachable-offenses|magazine=The New York Review of Books|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 10}}Section 10: Limits on the States==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Contract Clause===\n{{main|Contract Clause}}\n\n{{quote|No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit [[Bills of Credit]]; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.}}\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue [[bills of credit]] (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/110/421/case.html ''Juilliard v.

Federal Reserve Bank''<ref>262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923). See also ''[[Gwin v. Breedlove]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844); and ''[[Griffin v. Thompson]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844).</ref>). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist no. 44]]'', Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\".<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s5.html Madison, James ''Federalist Papers No. 44'']</ref> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ''ex post facto'' laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Contract Clause]] was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' was decided. The case involved the [[Yazoo land scandal]], in which the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature<!--which was basically all of them-->. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' involved [[Dartmouth College]], which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, [[New Hampshire]] passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]''. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In ''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws ''could'' apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal bankruptcy law]] in 1898.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Import-Export Clause===\n{{main|Import-Export Clause}}\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's{{sic}}<!-- Please do not remove the apostrophe in \"it's\".

States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Compact Clause===\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.}}\n\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace, or enter into alliances or compacts other states or with foreign governments. Furthermore, states may not engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a [[Militia (United States)|militia]] according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose members are also members of the militia as defined by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in a [[state defense force]] with federal oversight under {{UnitedStatesCode|32|109}}.\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to [[the Crown]] for approval. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an [[interstate compact]].  In ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".<ref>{{cite book |title=American Constitutional Law|last=Tribe |first=Laurence | authorlink=Laurence Tribe |year=2000 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=1-56662-714-1 |pages=649\u201351}}</ref> The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet [[Coming into force|effective]] [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] entered into by fifteen states plus the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=Michael|title=Circumventing the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Survives Constitutional Scrutiny Under the Compact Clause|journal=Legislation and Policy Brief|date=February 17, 2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40ff|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=lpb|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ American University Washington College of Law}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Peter H.

He is remembered for his heroism in [[1720]] during the [[Great Plague of Marseille]].\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Chevalier_Roze_\u00e0_la_Tourette_-_1720.PNG|left|thumb|Chevalier Roze woring at La Tourette during the heights of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Paiinting by [[Michel Serre]]]]\nNicolas Roze was born to a family of land owners from Solli\u00e8s, Var. One of his ancestors, Antoine Roze, had moved to Marseille in 1580 to found a hostel. Roze's descendants would involve themselves in naval matters, notably as carpenters to build galleys. The street name \"rue du Petit Chantier\" is a legacy of the shipyard, known at the time as \u00ab l\u2019Isle de Roze \u00bb.\n\nRoze became a shipowner, trading from 1695 between Marseille and [[Alicante]], where his brother Claude Roze was heading a merchant business. The same year, he married Claire Amiel, a baker. They had three children: Virginie, born on 5 June 1696, who grew to become a nun, and two boys who died in infancy.\n\nDuring the [[War of Spanish Succession]], Roze was wounded while commanding a military unit that he funded himself. Upon his return to Marseille, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made him a Knight in the Order of Saint-Lazare, and bestowed him a 10 000 pound rent. He then acquired the moniker of \"Chevalier Roze\".\n\nFrom 1716, Roze served as vice-consul of a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] on the Western coast of [[Peloponnese]], under Consul Joseph Maillet. He was tasked with maintaining the port infrastructure, checking and protecting commerce, as well as sanitary policies in the face of frequent epidemics.\n\nIn 1720, at the onset of the [[Great Plague of Marseille]], Roze proposed his services to the local authorities, the \u00e9chevins. Strong with his experience from Greece, he was made General Commissioner for the Rive-Neuve neighbourhood. He established a [[quarantine]] by setting up [[Security checkpoint|checkpoint]]s, and went as far as building gallows as a deterrence against looters. He also had five large [[mass grave]]s dug out, converted La Corderie into a field hospital, and organised distribution of humanitarian supply to the population. He furthermore organised supply for the city itself.\n\nOn 16 September 1720, Roze personally headed a 150-strong group of volunteers and prisoners to remove 1200 corpses in the poor neighbourhood of the Esplanade de la Tourette. Some of the corpses were three weeks old and contemporary sources describe them as \"hardly human in shape and set in movement by maggots\". In half an hour, the corpses were thrown into open pits that were then filled with lime and covered with soil.\n\nOut of 1200 volunters and prisonners deployed to fight the plague, only three survived. Roze himself caught the disease, but survived, although chances of survival without modern medicine are between 20 and 40%. He was later made governor of Brignoles in 1723.\n\nAfter his first wife died, Chevalier Roze remarried with 17-year old Magdeleine Rose Labasset, while he was 47 himself. They lived in a building in rue Poids de la Farine, near the [[Canebi\u00e8re]]. Nicolas Roze died there on 2 September 1733.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitaliers-saint-lazare.org/nicolas-roze.html|title=Nicolas Roze|date=|website=hospitaliers-saint-lazare.org|language=fr|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:DSC 0955Chevalier Roze-gradient.jpg|thumb|Buste du chevalier Roze \u00e0 Marseille]]\nThe name of Roze was given in his honour to\n\n* a street in the [[2nd arrondissement of Marseille|2e arrondissement]] of Marseille ;\n* the Southern turn of [[stade V\u00e9lodrome]], in Marseille.\n\nIn 1886, a bronze bust by Jean-Baptiste Hugues (1849-1930) was installed on Esplanade de la Tourette.
