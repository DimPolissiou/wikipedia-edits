It was represented in the [[House of Commons of England]] until 1707, and then in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] from 1707 to 1800, and finally in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 until 2010.\n\nUntil 1885, it was a [[parliamentary borough]], returning two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) until 1832 and only one from 1832 to 1885. The parliamentary borough was abolished in 1885, when the name was transferred to a [[county constituency]] returning one MP.  Elections used the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system when two MPs were returned, and the [[first-past-the-post]] system of election when one seat was contested.\n\nWestbury returned a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member at every election after 1924.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''': The Sessional Divisions of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Westbury, and Whorwellsdon, and part of the Sessional Division of Warminster.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Urban Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster, and Westbury, and the Rural Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Mere, Warminster, and Westbury and Whorwellsdown.\n\n'''1950\u20131974''': The Urban Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster, and Westbury, and the Rural Districts of Bradford-on-Avon and Melksham, Mere and Tisbury, and Warminster and Westbury.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The District of West Wiltshire, and the District of Salisbury wards of Knoyle, Mere, and Western.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The District of West Wiltshire wards of Adcroft, Bradford-on-Avon North, Bradford-on-Avon South, College, Corsley, Dilton Marsh, Drynham, Ethandune, Holt, John O'Gaunt, Manor Vale, Mid Wylye Valley, Park, Paxcroft, Shearwater, Summerham, Warminster East, Warminster West, Weavers, Westbrook, Westbury with Storridge, and Wylye Valley, and the District of Salisbury wards of Knoyle, Mere, and Western.\n\nOriginally a small [[pocket borough]], covering only a small part of the parish of [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]], in 1885 the parliamentary borough became a [[county constituency]] in [[Wiltshire]]. At the time of the constituency's abolition in 2010 it included the towns of [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]], [[Warminster]], [[Trowbridge]], and [[Bradford on Avon]], and the surrounding rural areas as far south as [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]]. Until boundary changes in 1997, it also included [[Melksham]].\n\n===Boundary review, 2005===\nFollowing a review of parliamentary representation in Wiltshire, the [[Boundary Commission for England]] created two new constituencies in the county. [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]] was created mostly from the adjoining [[North Wiltshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Wiltshire]] constituency, plus the town of [[Bradford on Avon]] at the northern end of the Westbury constituency, while the rest of Westbury saw minor changes to its composition and was renamed [[South West Wiltshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Wiltshire]]. These changes were approved in 2005, to take effect at the following general election, which ultimately took place in 2010.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n===Westbury borough (before 1885)===\n====MPs 1449\u20131640====\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second member\n|-\n| 1491|| [[Sir Thomas Long of Draycot]]\n|-\n| 1510-1523|| No names known <ref name = HoP2>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/westbury |title= History of Parliament| publisher = History of Parliament Trust| accessdate = 2011-10-27}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1529|| [[Thomas Kirton]]|| [[Thomas Temys]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1536|| ?\n|-\n| 1539|| ?\n|-\n| 1542|| ?\n|-\n| 1545|| [[William Hartgill]]|| [[Geoffrey Carter]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1547|| [[John Stokes (fl.1547)|John Stokes]]|| [[Kenelm Throckmorton]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1553 (Mar)|| ?\n|-\n| 1553 (Oct)|| [[Andrew Baynton]]|| [[Griffin Curteys]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1554 (Apr)|| [[Griffin Curteys]]|| [[Peter Morgan (MP)|Peter Morgan]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1554 (Nov)|| [[William Bennett (died 1574)|William Bennett]]|| [[Griffin Curteys]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1555|| [[Thomas Throckmorton (died 1568)|Sir Thomas Throckmorton]]|| [[William Hoskins (MP)|William Hoskins]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1558|| [[John Buckland (English politician)|John Buckland]]|| [[William Allen Helyer]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1559|| [[Anthony Carleton]]|| [[Ralph Skinner]]<ref name = HoP3>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/westbury |title= History of Parliament| publisher = History of Parliament Trust| accessdate = 2011-10-27}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1562/3|| [[Hugh Ryley]]|| [[John Dyster]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1571|| [[Francis Blount]]|| [[Thomas Long (died 1593)|Thomas Long]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1572||rowspan = \"2\"| [[William Brouncker (died 1596)|William Brouncker]]|| [[Henry Brouncker (died 1607)|Henry Brouncker]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1584||  [[Edward Midwinter]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1586|| [[Robert Baynard (died 1636)|Robert Baynard]]|| [[Henry Whitaker (died 1589)|Henry Whitaker]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1588|| [[Henry Fanshawe (1569\u20131616)|Sir Henry Fanshawe]] || [[John Bennett (fl. 1586\u201389)|John Bennett]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1593|| [[William Jordyn (died 1623)|William Jordyn]]|| [[Henry Fanshawe (1569\u20131616)|Sir Henry Fanshawe]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1597|| rowspan= \"6\"|[[Matthew Ley]]|| [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]]<ref name = HoP3/><ref>Wilfrid Prest, \u2018Ley, James, first earl of Marlborough (1550\u20131629)\u2019, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, Sept 2004|| online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16619], accessed 22 Jan 2009.</ref>\n|-\n| 1601||  [[Henry Jackman (MP)|Henry Jackman]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1604||  [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]]\n|-\n| 1605|| [[Alexander Chocke of Avington|Alexander Chocke]]\n|-\n| 1609|| [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]]\n|-\n| 1614||  [[Henry Ley (MP)|Henry Ley]]\n|-\n| 1621|| [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|Sir James Ley]] <br> replaced by [[Walter Long (c. 1594\u20131637)|Walter Long]]|| [[Miles Fleetwood|Sir Miles Fleetwood]]\n|-\n| 1624|| [[Henry Ley (MP)|Sir Henry Ley]]|| Sir [[Henry Mildmay]]\n|-\n| 1625|| rowspan = \"2\"|[[Walter Long (c. 1594\u20131637)|Sir Walter Long]]|| [[Gifford Long]]\n|-\n| 1626|| [[Thomas Hopton]]\n|-\n| 1628|| [[Maximillian Petty]] || [[Charles Thynne]]\n|-\n| 1629\u20131640|| colspan = \"2\"| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n====MPs 1640\u20131832====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!!!First member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{rayment-hc|w|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!First party!!!!Second member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Second party\n|-\n|[[Short Parliament|April 1640]]\n|style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" | \n|[[Sir Thomas Peniston|Sir Thomas Penyston]]||\n|style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[John Ashe (of Freshford)|John Ashe]] ||<!-- party -->\n|-\n|[[Long Parliament|November 1640]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" | \n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[John Ashe (of Freshford)|John Ashe]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]]\n|style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" | \n| [[Sir William Wheler, 1st Baronet|William Wheler]]||[[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] \n|-\n|December 1648\n|colspan=\"3\"|''Wheler excluded in [[Pride's Purge]] -

It was represented in the [[House of Commons of England]] until 1707, and then in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] from 1707 to 1800, and finally in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 until 2010.\n\nUntil 1885, it was a [[parliamentary borough]], returning two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) until 1832 and only one from 1832 to 1885. The parliamentary borough was abolished in 1885, when the name was transferred to a [[county constituency]] returning one MP.  Elections used the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system when two MPs were returned, and the [[first-past-the-post]] system of election when one seat was contested.\n\nWestbury returned a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member at every election after 1924.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''': The Sessional Divisions of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Westbury, and Whorwellsdon, and part of the Sessional Division of Warminster.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Urban Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster, and Westbury, and the Rural Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Mere, Warminster, and Westbury and Whorwellsdown.\n\n'''1950\u20131974''': The Urban Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster, and Westbury, and the Rural Districts of Bradford-on-Avon and Melksham, Mere and Tisbury, and Warminster and Westbury.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The District of West Wiltshire, and the District of Salisbury wards of Knoyle, Mere, and Western.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The District of West Wiltshire wards of Adcroft, Bradford-on-Avon North, Bradford-on-Avon South, College, Corsley, Dilton Marsh, Drynham, Ethandune, Holt, John O'Gaunt, Manor Vale, Mid Wylye Valley, Park, Paxcroft, Shearwater, Summerham, Warminster East, Warminster West, Weavers, Westbrook, Westbury with Storridge, and Wylye Valley, and the District of Salisbury wards of Knoyle, Mere, and Western.\n\nOriginally a small [[pocket borough]], covering only a small part of the parish of [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]], in 1885 the parliamentary borough became a [[county constituency]] in [[Wiltshire]]. At the time of the constituency's abolition in 2010 it included the towns of [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]], [[Warminster]], [[Trowbridge]], and [[Bradford on Avon]], and the surrounding rural areas as far south as [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]]. Until boundary changes in 1997, it also included [[Melksham]].\n\n===Boundary review, 2005===\nFollowing a review of parliamentary representation in Wiltshire, the [[Boundary Commission for England]] created two new constituencies in the county. [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]] was created mostly from the adjoining [[North Wiltshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Wiltshire]] constituency, plus the town of [[Bradford on Avon]] at the northern end of the Westbury constituency, while the rest of Westbury saw minor changes to its composition and was renamed [[South West Wiltshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Wiltshire]]. These changes were approved in 2005, to take effect at the following general election, which ultimately took place in 2010.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n===Westbury borough (before 1885)===\n====MPs 1449\u20131640====\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second member\n|-\n| 1491|| [[Sir Thomas Long of Draycot]]\n|-\n| 1510-1523|| No names known <ref name = HoP2>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/westbury |title= History of Parliament| publisher = History of Parliament Trust| accessdate = 2011-10-27}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1529|| [[Thomas Kirton]]|| [[Thomas Temys]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1536|| ?\n|-\n| 1539|| ?\n|-\n| 1542|| ?\n|-\n| 1545|| [[William Hartgill]]|| [[Geoffrey Carter]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1547|| [[John Stokes (fl.1547)|John Stokes]]|| [[Kenelm Throckmorton]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1553 (Mar)|| ?\n|-\n| 1553 (Oct)|| [[Andrew Baynton]]|| [[Griffin Curteys]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1554 (Apr)|| [[Griffin Curteys]]|| [[Peter Morgan (MP)|Peter Morgan]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1554 (Nov)|| [[William Bennett (died 1574)|William Bennett]]|| [[Griffin Curteys]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1555|| [[Thomas Throckmorton (died 1568)|Sir Thomas Throckmorton]]|| [[William Hoskins (MP)|William Hoskins]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1558|| [[John Buckland (English politician)|John Buckland]]|| [[William Allen Helyer]] <ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n| 1559|| [[Anthony Carleton]]|| [[Ralph Skinner]]<ref name = HoP3>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/westbury |title= History of Parliament| publisher = History of Parliament Trust| accessdate = 2011-10-27}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1562/3|| [[Hugh Ryley]]|| [[John Dyster]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1571|| [[Francis Blount]]|| [[Thomas Long (died 1593)|Thomas Long]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1572||rowspan = \"2\"| [[William Brouncker (died 1596)|William Brouncker]]|| [[Henry Brouncker (died 1607)|Henry Brouncker]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1584||  [[Edward Midwinter]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1586|| [[Robert Baynard (died 1636)|Robert Baynard]]|| [[Henry Whitaker (died 1589)|Henry Whitaker]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1588|| [[Henry Fanshawe (1569\u20131616)|Sir Henry Fanshawe]] || [[John Bennett (fl. 1586\u201389)|John Bennett]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1593|| [[William Jordyn (died 1623)|William Jordyn]]|| [[Henry Fanshawe (1569\u20131616)|Sir Henry Fanshawe]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1597|| rowspan= \"6\"|[[Matthew Ley]]|| [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]]<ref name = HoP3/><ref>Wilfrid Prest, \u2018Ley, James, first earl of Marlborough (1550\u20131629)\u2019, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, Sept 2004|| online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16619], accessed 22 Jan 2009.</ref>\n|-\n| 1601||  [[Henry Jackman (MP)|Henry Jackman]] <ref name = HoP3/>\n|-\n| 1604||  [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]]\n|-\n| 1605|| [[Alexander Chocke of Avington|Alexander Chocke]]\n|-\n| 1609|| [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]]\n|-\n| 1614||  [[Henry Ley (MP)|Henry Ley]]\n|-\n| 1621|| [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|Sir James Ley]] <br> replaced by [[Walter Long (c. 1594\u20131637)|Walter Long]]|| [[Miles Fleetwood|Sir Miles Fleetwood]]\n|-\n| 1624|| [[Henry Ley (MP)|Sir Henry Ley]]|| Sir [[Henry Mildmay]]\n|-\n| 1625|| rowspan = \"2\"|[[Walter Long (c. 1594\u20131637)|Sir Walter Long]]|| [[Gifford Long]]\n|-\n| 1626|| [[Thomas Hopton]]\n|-\n| 1628|| [[Maximillian Petty]] || [[Charles Thynne]]\n|-\n| 1629\u20131640|| colspan = \"2\"| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n====MPs 1640\u20131832====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!!!First member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{rayment-hc|w|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!First party!!!!Second member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Second party\n|-\n|[[Short Parliament|April 1640]]\n|style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" | \n|[[Sir Thomas Peniston|Sir Thomas Penyston]]||\n|style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[John Ashe (of Freshford)|John Ashe]] ||<!-- party -->\n|-\n|[[Long Parliament|November 1640]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" | \n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[John Ashe (of Freshford)|John Ashe]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]]\n|style=\"background-color: {{/meta/color}}\" | \n| [[Sir William Wheler, 1st Baronet|William Wheler]]||[[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] \n|-\n|December 1648\n|colspan=\"3\"|''Wheler excluded in [[Pride's Purge]] -

His grandfather was counted as one of the \"companions and advisors\" (\u540c\u670b\u8846, ''d\u014db\u014dsh\u016b'') of Sh\u014dgun [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]]. K\u014detsu's father, Hon'ami K\u014dji (d. 1603), received a regular stipend from the [[Maeda family]], in payment for his services as a sword connoisseur. K\u014detsu would continue this relationship of his family with that of the Maeda, and with their domain in [[Kaga Province]]; he would advise the Maeda on swords, paintings, and other art objects. K\u014detsu would meet many members of the art community through his connections with the Maeda, including tea master [[Kobori Ensh\u016b]].\n\nK\u014detsu would also develop a close relationship with the [[Noh|N\u014d]] theater, and with the [[Kanze family]] of actors who lived near the Hon'ami family compound in northern Kyoto. He may have performed in N\u014d productions as a chanter, and designed a number of works for use by the actors or the theater.\n[[File:Honami Koetsu - CALLIGRAPHY OF POEMS from the Shinkokin-wakashu on Paper Decorated with Deer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|CALLIGRAPHY OF POEMS from the Shinkokin-wakashu on Paper Decorated with Deer]]\n\n==Skills==\n[[File:Periodo edo, scatola per scrittura, di hon'ami koetsu, XVII sec.JPG|thumb|left|''Writing Box with Pontoon Bridge'' by K\u014detsu]] \nAlthough trained as a swordpolisher (not a \"swordsmith\" in the standard Western sense; in Japan the tasks of forging and finishing a blade are performed by different craftsmen), Hon'ami became accomplished in pottery, [[lacquer]], and ceramics as a result of his interest in [[Japanese tea ceremony]], which had been revived and refined only a few decades earlier by [[Sen no Riky\u016b]]. In this art, he is regarded as one of the top pupils of the tea master [[Furuta Oribe]] and of the style known as [[Raku ware]].  Koetsu was given clay by Donyu II, the grandson of the first Raku potter, Ch\u014djir\u014d I.

He was taught in this field by [[Prince Sonch\u014d]], who is said to have taught him the style of the famous classical Chinese calligrapher [[Wang Xizhi]]. He produced a wide variety of works, all in a flowing cursive style that recalled those classical traditions. Along with [[Konoe Nobutada]] and [[Sh\u014dkad\u014d Sh\u014dj\u014d]], he came to be known as one of the Three Brushes or [[Sanpitsu]] of the [[Kan'ei|Kan'ei Era]] (\u5bdb\u6c38\u306e\u4e09\u7b46, ''kan'ei no sanpitsu''). Though he created a number of works in this classical style, K\u014detsu also developed his own personal style of calligraphy, and taught it to many of his students.\n\nLacquer was yet another field in which K\u014detsu was innovative and very active. Though earlier works attributed to him are quite conservative, towards the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th, he began to employ a number of innovative techniques. He specialized in designs using tin, lead and other base metals, along with gold and mother-of-pearl.\n\n==Collaborations==\nHon'ami entertained a close relationship with the painter [[Tawaraya S\u014dtatsu]], who is supposed to have decorated many of Hon'ami calligraphic works in [[gold leaf]] and paint. The two worked very closely for about fifteen years after the turn of the 17th century, and some scholars believe the two artists were related by marriage. S\u014dtatsu was a major member of the Rinpa school, and his paintings most likely reflect some degree of Hon'ami's influence and style.\n\n==Artist community==\n\n[[Image:Koetsuji-Honami-Koetsu-Grave.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Honami K\u014detsu's grave, [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]]]\nIn 1615, Hon'ami began an artist community northwest of Kyoto, in a place called Takagamine granted him by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Scholars disagree on whether this community was more focused on art or on religion, specifically [[Nichiren Buddhism]], and whether this land grant was generous, or a form of exile. Nevertheless, it was here that Hon'ami would develop his unique style of painting and design which would later develop into the Rinpa school. The retreat was called Taikyo-an, and was used for prayer meetings and meditation, in addition to its function as an artist colony. A number of important figures, including the historian [[Hayashi Razan]], visited there towards the end of K\u014detsu's life. After his death in 1637, the colony was disbanded and the land was returned to the shogunate by Hon'ami K\u014dho, K\u014detsu's grandson.\n\n==Collectors==\n[[Ernest Fenollosa]], one of the first American collectors and critics of Japanese art, is quoted as writing that Hon'ami is the only artist of what Fenollosa called the Early Modern period worthy of being compared to the earlier masters.<ref name=\"Extraordinary\"/>\n\nKoetsu Honami was portrayed and made reference to in Inagaki Hiroshi's film [[Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple]], about the life of Miyamoto Musashi.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n* Fister, Pat (1985). \"Hon'ami K\u014detsu.\" Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan<.

He specialized in designs using tin, lead and other base metals, along with gold and mother-of-pearl.\n\n==Collaborations==\nHon'ami entertained a close relationship with the painter [[Tawaraya S\u014dtatsu]], who is supposed to have decorated many of Hon'ami calligraphic works in [[gold leaf]] and paint. The two worked very closely for about fifteen years after the turn of the 17th century, and some scholars believe the two artists were related by marriage. S\u014dtatsu was a major member of the Rinpa school, and his paintings most likely reflect some degree of Hon'ami's influence and style.\n\n==Artist community==\n\n[[Image:Koetsuji-Honami-Koetsu-Grave.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Honami K\u014detsu's grave, [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]]]\nIn 1615, Hon'ami began an artist community northwest of Kyoto, in a place called Takagamine granted him by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Scholars disagree on whether this community was more focused on art or on religion, specifically [[Nichiren Buddhism]], and whether this land grant was generous, or a form of exile. Nevertheless, it was here that Hon'ami would develop his unique style of painting and design which would later develop into the Rinpa school. The retreat was called Taikyo-an, and was used for prayer meetings and meditation, in addition to its function as an artist colony. A number of important figures, including the historian [[Hayashi Razan]], visited there towards the end of K\u014detsu's life. After his death in 1637, the colony was disbanded and the land returned to the shogunate by Hon'ami K\u014dho, K\u014detsu's grandson.\n\n==Collectors==\n[[Ernest Fenollosa]], one of the first American collectors and critics of Japanese art, is quoted as writing that Hon'ami is the only artist of what Fenollosa called the Early Modern period worthy of being compared to the earlier masters.<ref name=\"Extraordinary\"/>\n\nKoetsu Honami was portrayed and made reference to in Inagaki Hiroshi's film [[Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple]], about the life of Miyamoto Musashi.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n* Fister, Pat (1985). \"Hon'ami K\u014detsu.\" Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan<.

A photograph of a train at the station in Great Central days shows a station nameboard bearing the wording \"Lowton St Mary's\".{{sfn|Pixton|1996|p=118}}\n\nThe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its name in 1897 to the [[Great Central Railway]] (GCR). The GCR absorbed the WJR on 1 January 1906.{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=105}}\n\nThe WJR line ran through Lancashire from Glazebrook West Junction to [[Wigan Central railway station|Wigan Central]]{{sfn|Conolly|1998|loc=p. 45, section C3}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 45}} but was also a part of the bigger MS&LR/GCR network and therefore trains were originally provided by the MS&LR.\n\nIn 1895 goods services began on a wholly new line which branched westwards off the WJR a short distance north of Lowton St Mary's station. This line was built by the [[Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway]], a subsidiary of the [[Great Central Railway]]. That line was part of an ambitious project to reach the north Liverpool docks, but only ever made it as far as [[St Helens Central (GCR) railway station|St Helens Central (GCR)]]. The first recorded passenger train ran on that line in 1899, a race day special to [[Haydock Park Racecourse]]. The full, but sparse, passenger service began on 3 January 1900.{{sfn|Dow|1965|pp=9\u201312}}\n\n==Services==\n\nIn April 1884 there were seven trains in each direction per day, all running between [[Manchester Central railway station]] and [[Wigan Central railway station|Wigan Central]]. Of these, six called at Lowton St Mary's. Two trains each way ran on Sundays, calling at all stations en route.{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=354}}\n\nFrom 1900 until 1952 Lowton St Mary's was also served by passenger trains running to [[St Helens Central (GCR) railway station|St Helens Central]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/culcheth/index.shtml |title=Timetables |website=Disused Stations }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 five \"down\" (towards St Helens and Wigan) trains called at the station on Mondays to Saturdays. They called at all stations from Manchester Central to St Helens via Glazebrook and Culcheth. It is difficult to be certain from the timetable whether these trains split at Lowton St Mary's with a portion proceeding to Wigan Central, or whether passengers for Wigan had to change, but in either event those same six trains also took Lowton St Mary's passengers calling at all stations to Wigan. Given the dwell times for St Helens trains, it appears that theirs was a through service.\n\nA lone train calling at all stations from Manchester to Wigan - the 18:46 from Lowton St Mary's - had no St Helens connection or portion, serving the Wigan Central line only.\n\nThree Down trains, one Fridays and Saturdays Only and two Saturdays only, appeared to start at Culcheth calling All Stations to Wigan Central, with no St Helens portion or connection. It may be that these trains originated at [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]], turning West to North at the triangular Glazebrook West Junction, but the timetable doesn't seem to confirm this.\n\nThe \"up\" service was broadly similar, but the mix of all week and Saturdays Only/Excepted was more complex.\n\nNo trains ran on Sundays.{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|pp=714\u20135}}\n\nIn the [[Second World War]] the line through Lowton St Mary's was more frequently used, though after 1945 the line started to deteriorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/culcheth/index.shtml |title=Timetables |website=Disused Stations }}</ref>\n\nA fuller selection of public and working timetables has now been published.

Pixton, for example, has a fine 1961 shot of a Summer Saturday Sheffield to Blackpool train at the station.

[[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] (MS&LR).{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=104}} One source gives the station's early name as plain \"Lowton\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/l/lowton_st_marys/ |title=The station's history |website=Disused Stations }}</ref> but the Bradshaws of April 1884{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=354}} and July 1922 both use \"Lowton St Mary's\".{{sfn|Bradshaw|1922|pp=714\u20135}} 19th Century Lowton, like Langwith in Derbyshire, was a scattered rural ''area'' rather than one village, with communities having related names, such as Lowton St Mary's and Lowton Common as well as the plain Lowton. A photograph of a train at the station in Great Central days shows a station nameboard bearing the wording \"Lowton St Mary's\".{{sfn|Pixton|1996|p=118}}\n\nThe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its name in 1897 to the [[Great Central Railway]] (GCR). The GCR absorbed the WJR on 1 January 1906.{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=105}}\n\nThe WJR line ran through Lancashire from Glazebrook West Junction to [[Wigan Central railway station|Wigan Central]]{{sfn|Conolly|1976|loc=p. 45, section C3}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 45}} but was also a part of the bigger MS&LR/GCR network and therefore trains were originally provided by the MS&LR.\n\nIn 1895 goods services began on a wholly new line which branched westwards off the WJR a short distance north of Lowton St Mary's station. This line was built by the [[Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway]], a subsidiary of the [[Great Central Railway]]. That line was part of an ambitious project to reach the north Liverpool docks, but only ever made it as far as [[St Helens Central (GCR) railway station|St Helens Central (GCR)]]. The first recorded passenger train ran on that line in 1899, a race day special to [[Haydock Park Racecourse]]. The full, but sparse, passenger service began on 3 January 1900.{{sfn|Dow|1965|pp=9\u201312}}\n\n==Services==\n\nIn April 1884 there were seven trains in each direction per day, all running between [[Manchester Central railway station]] and [[Wigan Central railway station|Wigan Central]]. Of these, six called at Lowton St Mary's. Two trains each way ran on Sundays, calling at all stations en route.{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=354}}\n\nFrom 1900 until 1952 Lowton St Mary's was also served by passenger trains running to [[St Helens Central (GCR) railway station|St Helens Central]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/culcheth/index.shtml |title=Timetables |website=Disused Stations }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 five \"down\" (towards St Helens and Wigan) trains called at the station on Mondays to Saturdays. They called at all stations from Manchester Central to St Helens via Glazebrook and Culcheth.
