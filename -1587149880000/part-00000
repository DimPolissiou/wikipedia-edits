It is the higher-end model of the [[MacBook family]], sitting above the consumer-focused [[MacBook Air]], and is available in 13-inch and 16-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was sold from April 2006 to June 2012.\n\nThe first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the [[PowerBook G4]], but replaced [[PowerPC G4]] chips with [[Intel Core]] [[central processing unit|processors]], added a [[webcam]], and introduced the [[MagSafe]] power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added [[Intel Core 2|Core 2 Duo]] processors and [[LED-backlit LCD|LED-backlit displays]].\n\nThe second-generation model debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch variants, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. Known as the \"unibody\" model because its case was machined from a single piece of aluminum, it had a thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose entire surface was a single clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates brought [[Intel Core i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] processors and introduced Intel's [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology.\n\nThe third-generation MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June 2012, a 13-inch model in October. It is thinner than its predecessor, makes [[Solid-state drive|solid-state storage]] standard, and includes a high-resolution [[Retina display]]. \n\nThe fourth-generation MacBook Pro was released in October 2016. This generation uses [[USB-C]] for all data ports and power. It includes a shallower \"butterfly\"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the function keys were replaced with a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar with a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated into the power button.\n\nThe fifth-generation MacBook Pro was released in November 2019. It has a 16-inch screen with narrower bezels and returns to a scissor-mechanism keyboard. \n\n==First generation (Aluminum)==\n[[File:MacBook Pro.png|thumb|The MacBook Pro 15\" in 2006]]\nThe original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006, by [[Steve Jobs]] at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo#2006|Macworld Conference & Expo]].<ref name=\"mbprelease\">{{cite press release | url = https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Pro/ | title = Apple Introduces MacBook Pro | date = January 10, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100108140023/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10macbookpro.html | archive-date = January 8, 2010 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.<ref name=\"mbp17release\">{{cite press release | url = https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/04/24Apple-Introduces-17-inch-MacBook-Pro/ | title = Apple Introduces 17-inch MacBook Pro | date = April 24, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100328153158/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/apr/24macbookpro.html | archive-date = March 28, 2010 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses [[Intel Core]] [[CPU]]s instead of [[PowerPC G4]] chips.<ref name=\"early2006macworld\">{{cite web | last = Snell | first = Jason | date = February 25, 2006 | url = http://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | title = MacBook Pro/1.83{{nbsp}}GHz and 2.0{{nbsp}}GHz | work=[[MacWorld]] | accessdate =April 18, 2010}}</ref> The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} deeper, {{convert|0.4|in|cm}} wider, and {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} thinner.<ref name=\"ars early 2006\">{{cite web | last = Cheng | first = Jacqui | date = March 1, 2006 | url = https://arstechnica.com/hardware/reviews/2006/03/macbookpro.ars | title = MacBook Pro | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate =April 22, 2010}}</ref> Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in [[iSight]] [[webcam]] and the inclusion of [[MagSafe]], a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked.

While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.\"<ref name=\"CNET June 9 review\" /> By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15\" and 17\" models. Furthermore, the addition of [[Mini DisplayPort]] instead of the more popular [[HDMI]] was criticized.<ref name=\"notebook review late 2008\" /> The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.<ref name=\"notebook review late 2008\" />\n\n''Laptop Magazine''{{'}}s Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it \"bright and crisp\". He further commented, \"While reflections from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also nice to know there's an antiglare option\u2014though only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally.\" He also lauded the quality of the [[iSight]] webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15\" model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of [[USB]] ports, and the lack of [[HDMI]].<ref name=\"laptopmag2010\" />\n\n[[CNET Networks|CNET]] praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the [[Mini DisplayPort]] video output.<ref name=\"CNET 2010\" /> They also called for the addition of HDMI and the [[Blu-ray]] [[optical disc]] format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features.<ref name=\"CNET 2010\" /> CNET also criticized the option of a higher-resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying that \"the higher-resolution screen should be included by default.\"<ref name=\"CNET 2010\" />\n\n=== <span id=\"Second generation technical specifications\"></span> Technical specifications ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF9999;\"|\n| <abbr title=\"Mac products that were discontinued 7 years ago and no longer receive hardware support from Apple or service providers, nor support the latest macOS software release.\">Obsolete</abbr><ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 |title=Vintage and obsolete products |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]}}</ref>\n| style=\"background:#FFDDDD;\"|\n| <abbr title=\"Mac products that were discontinued between 5 and 7 years ago and no longer support the latest macOS software release.

The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel, and the removal of the internal optical drive and the battery indicator button and light on the side of the chassis. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button.<ref>[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405665,00.asp Hands On: 15-Inch Apple MacBook Pro With Retina Display] June 12, 2012.</ref> At {{convert|0.71|in|mm|0}} thick, the 15-inch model is 25{{nbsp}}percent thinner than its predecessor.

It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of ''[[Macworld]]'' said that the Retina MacBook Pro was \"groundbreaking\" and made people \"rethink how they use technology\". He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body.<ref name=\"mwreviewrmbp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1167286/macbook_pro_with_retina_display_redefines_the_concept_of_a_pro_laptop.html | title=MacBook Pro with Retina Display redefines the concept of a 'pro' laptop | publisher=[[Macworld]] | date=June 15, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012 | first=Roman | last=Loyola}}</ref> [[Dan Ackerman]] of [[CNET]] commented \"I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all-around laptops you can buy.

Fourth generation (Touch Bar) ==\n<span id=\"Fourth generation\"></span>[[File:Late 2016 MacBook Pro.jpg|thumb|The 15-inch late 2016 MacBook Pro]]\nApple unveiled fourth-generation 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their [[Infinite Loop (street)|headquarters]] on October 27, 2016. All models, except for the baseline 13-inch model, introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled [[OLED]] strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the [[function key]]s. The Touch Bar models also include a sapphire-glass covered [[Touch ID]] sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a \"second-generation\" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina [[MacBook (Retina)|MacBook]]. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.\n\nAll ports have been replaced with either two or four combination [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt 3]] ports that support [[USB-C|USB-C 3.1 Gen 2]] and dual [[DisplayPort]] 1.2 signals,<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/14/late-2016-mbp-amd-gpus-support-dual-5k-displays/|title=New MacBook Pro's Dedicated AMD Graphics Chips Are 'Significantly' Faster and Support Dual 5K Displays|access-date=2017-11-01}}</ref> any of which can be used for charging.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/apple/2016/11/macbook-pro-2016-no-touch-bar-review/|title=The \u00a31,450 2016 MacBook Pro reviewed: An expensive MacBook Air on the inside|newspaper=Ars Technica UK|access-date=November 6, 2016}}</ref> The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/03/2016-macbook-pro-thunderbolt-compatibility-issues/|title=2016 MacBook Pros may not be compatible with currently available Thunderbolt 3 devices |access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/11/03/new-macbook-pro-models-reportedly-incompatible-with-certain-thunderbolt-3-devices|title=New MacBook Pro models reportedly incompatible with certain Thunderbolt 3 devices |access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/239113-apples-new-dongle-happy-macbook-pros-not-fully-compatible-thunderbolt-3-peripherals|title=Apple's new dongle-happy MacBook Pros not fully compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals |access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> Furthermore, [[macOS]] on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them.<ref>https://github.com/KhaosT/tb3-enabler</ref> Support for Thunderbolt 3 external [[graphics processing unit]]s (eGPU) was added in [[macOS High Sierra|macOS High Sierra 10.13.4]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Use an external graphics processor with your Mac | publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | date=July 3, 2019 | url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208544 | access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref> Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/usb-type-c-thunderbolt-3-one-cable-to-connect-them-all/|title=Here's everything you need to know about USB-C and Thunderbolt 3|newspaper=CNET|access-date=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587</ref> The models come with a [[Phone connector (audio)|3.5 mm headphone jack]], although [[TOSLINK]] functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.\n\nOther updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core [[Intel]] [[Skylake (microarchitecture)|\"Skylake\"]] Core i5 and i7 processors, improved graphics, and displays that offer a 25% wider [[Gamut|color gamut]], 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a [[5K resolution|5K]] display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete [[AMD Radeon Pro#Radeon Pro (Mobile)|Radeon Pro 450]], 455 or 460 graphics card in addition to the integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not upgradeable, while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable, but difficult to replace, as it is a proprietary format of SSD storage.<ref name=\"ifixit.com\">https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Touch+Bar+Teardown/73480</ref><ref>http://blog.macsales.com/38440-ssd-in-late-2016-entry-level-macbook-pro-removable</ref>\n\nOn June 5, 2017, Apple updated the line with Intel [[Kaby Lake]] processors and newer graphics cards. Additionally, the 13-inch model now comes with a 128GB storage option, down from the base 256GB storage.<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/apple-gives-the-macbook-and-macbook-pros-a-kaby-lake-refresh/ Apple gives the MacBook and MacBook Pros a Kaby Lake refresh].

A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are \"largely cosmetic\", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/17/13665258/macbook-pro-speaker-grille-fake-teardown</ref> The fourth-generation MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker \"space gray\" color. The MacBook Pro model name returns to the bottom of the screen bezel in Apple's [[San Francisco (2014 typeface)|San Francisco]] font after being absent from the third generation. As with the Retina [[MacBook (Retina)|MacBook]], the new models replace the backlit white Apple logo on the rear of the screen, a feature dating back to the 1999 [[PowerBook G3]], with a glossy black opaque version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/28/new-mbp-no-backlit-logo-or-power-extension-cable/|title=New MacBook Pros Don't Include Backlit Apple Logo or Power Extension Cable|last=Rossignol|first=Joe|website=www.macrumors.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nMagSafe, a magnetic charging connector, has been replaced with USB-C charging.<ref name=\":2\" /> Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user's field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Macintosh startup chime that has been used since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Battery life===\nThe battery life of the new models also received mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent battery life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update.<ref name=\"bloomberg-alienated\">{{cite web|title=How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-20/how-apple-alienated-mac-loyalists|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-estimateremoved\">{{cite web|title=Apple 'fixes' inaccurate MacBook Pro battery estimate \u2013 by removing it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/apple-fixes-inaccurate-macbook-pro-battery-estimate-by-removing-it|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites).

And it ended up running at 2.2GHz due to the heat generated inside the chassis forcing it to throttle.

The display, build quality, and audio quality were praised but many complaints went toward the keyboard butterfly switch, the touch bar not being useful in many applications due to a lack of development for it, and the lack of any [[USB|USB-A]] ports, HDMI port or an SD card slot.\n\n''[[Ars Technica]]'' noted that the second-generation keyboard with firm keys was a \"drastic departure\" from previous [[MacBook (Retina)|Retina MacBook]] keyboards. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it.<ref name=\":2\" /> Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage.<ref name=\":2\" /> ''[[Engadget]]'' praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price.<ref>https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/14/macbook-pro-review-2016/</ref> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' praised the display, calling it \"the best laptop display I've ever seen\", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors.<ref>https://www.wired.com/2016/11/review-apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar/</ref> Likewise, ''[[The Verge]]'' concluded that \"using [the new MacBook] is alienating to anyone living in the present.

Developers have their share of headaches because they cannot rely on the Touch Bar being present on every machine that runs their software. Even if Apple makes the Touch Bar an integral part of macOS, it will take \"many years\" for it to become ubiquitous, in the meantime anything in the Bar needs to be available through another part of the interface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/04/11/apple-macbook-customer-satisfaction-fall/|title=Apple Losing Out As Consumers Reject The New MacBook Pro|last=Spence|first=Ewan|date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther items of critique were non-compatibility between Thunderbolt 2 and 3 devices, frequently unpleasant fan whine noises in idle CPU states on the larger screen (15\") models were reported, where the two integrated fans run all the time by default.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The [[coprocessor]] powering the touch bar and higher [[Thermal design power|TDP]] of the stronger CPU models are responsible for this behavior.\n\nYouTube tech reviewer Dave Lee was very critical of the high price of the MacBook Pro.

It is the higher-end model of the [[MacBook family]], sitting above the consumer-focused [[MacBook Air]], and is available in 13-inch and 16-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was sold from April 2006 to June 2012.\n\nThe first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the [[PowerBook G4]], but replaced [[PowerPC G4]] chips with [[Intel Core]] [[central processing unit|processors]], added a [[webcam]], and introduced the [[MagSafe]] power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added [[Intel Core 2|Core 2 Duo]] processors and [[LED-backlit LCD|LED-backlit displays]].\n\nThe second-generation model debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch variants, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. Known as the \"unibody\" model because its case was machined from a single piece of aluminum, it had a thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose entire surface was a single clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates brought [[Intel Core i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] processors and introduced Intel's [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology.\n\nThe third-generation MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June 2012, a 13-inch model in October. It is thinner than its predecessor, makes [[Solid-state drive|solid-state storage]] standard, and includes a high-resolution [[Retina display]]. \n\nThe fourth-generation MacBook Pro was released in October 2016. This generation uses [[USB-C]] for all data ports and power. It includes a shallower \"butterfly\"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the function keys were replaced with a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar with a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated into the power button.\n\nThe fifth-generation MacBook Pro was released in November 2019. It has a 16-inch screen with narrower bezels and returns to a scissor-mechanism keyboard. \n\n==First generation (Aluminum)==\n[[File:MacBook Pro.png|thumb|The MacBook Pro 15\" in 2006]]\nThe original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006, by [[Steve Jobs]] at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo#2006|Macworld Conference & Expo]].<ref name=\"mbprelease\">{{cite press release | url = https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Pro/ | title = Apple Introduces MacBook Pro | date = January 10, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100108140023/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10macbookpro.html | archive-date = January 8, 2010 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.<ref name=\"mbp17release\">{{cite press release | url = https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/04/24Apple-Introduces-17-inch-MacBook-Pro/ | title = Apple Introduces 17-inch MacBook Pro | date = April 24, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100328153158/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/apr/24macbookpro.html | archive-date = March 28, 2010 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses [[Intel Core]] [[CPU]]s instead of [[PowerPC G4]] chips.<ref name=\"early2006macworld\">{{cite web | last = Snell | first = Jason | date = February 25, 2006 | url = http://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | title = MacBook Pro/1.83{{nbsp}}GHz and 2.0{{nbsp}}GHz | work=[[MacWorld]] | accessdate =April 18, 2010}}</ref> The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} deeper, {{convert|0.4|in|cm}} wider, and {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} thinner.<ref name=\"ars early 2006\">{{cite web | last = Cheng | first = Jacqui | date = March 1, 2006 | url = https://arstechnica.com/hardware/reviews/2006/03/macbookpro.ars | title = MacBook Pro | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate =April 22, 2010}}</ref> Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in [[iSight]] [[webcam]] and the inclusion of [[MagSafe]], a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked.

MacBook Pro models during a press event at their [[Infinite Loop (street)|headquarters]] on October 27, 2016. All models, except for the baseline 13-inch model, introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled [[OLED]] strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the [[function key]]s. The Touch Bar models also include a sapphire-glass covered [[Touch ID]] sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a \"second-generation\" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina [[MacBook (Retina)|MacBook]].

A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are \"largely cosmetic\", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/17/13665258/macbook-pro-speaker-grille-fake-teardown</ref> The fourth-generation MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker \"space gray\" color. The MacBook Pro model name returns to the bottom of the screen bezel in Apple's [[San Francisco (2014 typeface)|San Francisco]] font after being absent from the third generation. As with the Retina [[MacBook (Retina)|MacBook]], the new models replace the backlit white Apple logo on the rear of the screen, a feature dating back to the 1999 [[PowerBook G3]], with a glossy black opaque version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/28/new-mbp-no-backlit-logo-or-power-extension-cable/|title=New MacBook Pros Don't Include Backlit Apple Logo or Power Extension Cable|last=Rossignol|first=Joe|website=www.macrumors.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nMagSafe, a magnetic charging connector, has been replaced with USB-C charging.<ref name=\":2\" /> Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user's field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator.

The display, build quality, and audio quality were praised but many complaints went toward the keyboard butterfly switch, the touch bar not being useful in many applications due to a lack of development for it, and the lack of any [[USB|USB-A]] ports, HDMI port or an SD card slot.\n\n''[[Ars Technica]]'' noted that the second-generation keyboard with firm keys was a \"drastic departure\" from previous [[MacBook (Retina)|Retina MacBook]] keyboards. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it.<ref name=\":2\" /> Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage.<ref name=\":2\" /> ''[[Engadget]]'' praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price.<ref>https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/14/macbook-pro-review-2016/</ref> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' praised the display, calling it \"the best laptop display I've ever seen\", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors.<ref>https://www.wired.com/2016/11/review-apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar/</ref> Likewise, ''[[The Verge]]'' concluded that \"using [the new MacBook] is alienating to anyone living in the present.

Nickelodeon attractions currently exist at [[Movie Park Germany]], [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], [[Mall of America]] and [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], as well as [[American Dream Meadowlands]]. Attractions previously existed at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Kings Island]], [[Universal Studios Florida]], [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[WhiteWater World]].\n\n==History==\nOn June 7, 1990, [[Universal Studios Florida]] opened with an attraction named [[Nickelodeon Studios]]. It was a television taping studio for the [[Cable channel|cable television channel]] Nickelodeon.\n\nIn 1995, ''[[Nickelodeon Splat City]]'' opened at three former [[Paramount Parks]]: [[California's Great America]], [[Kings Dominion]] and [[Kings Island]]. These attractions were inspired by the game shows that aired on the television network and generally involved slime. In 1999, Kings Dominion closed Nickelodeon Splat City in preparation for the opening of its 2000 attraction, Nickelodeon Central. ''Nickelodeon Central'' brought a retheme of many of the park's children's rides as well as the addition of new ones. Kings Island followed suit, closing its Splat City in 2000 and opening ''Nickelodeon Central'' in 2001. This area would later be expanded and renamed ''Nickelodeon Universe'' in 2006.\n\nIn 2002, Australian theme park [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] opened Nickelodeon Central.<ref name=\"Dreamworld History\">{{cite web|title=Dreamworld History|url=http://www.dreamworld.com.au/Schools/pdf/DW-Schools-History.pdf|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2003, ''Nickelodeon Central'' opened at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]] and [[Carowinds]], and [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]] opened in Universal Studios Florida. Expansions of these areas took place in 2005, 2006 and 2008 for Carowinds, Kings Island and Dreamworld, respectively. The Kings Island area was also renamed to ''Nickelodeon Universe'' at the same time. In 2007, Movie Park Germany opened a similar area entitled ''Nickland''. In 2007, it was announced that ''Nickelodeon Universe'' would be opening in [[Mall of America]] in 2008, replacing ''[[Camp Snoopy]]''. In 2009 and 2010, Cedar Fair terminated their contract with Nickelodeon resulting in all of the areas being rethemed to ''Planet Snoopy''. In early 2011, at a cost of {{Currency|10|GBP}} million, Pleasure Beach Blackpool opened ''Nickelodeon Land''.<ref name=\"PBB announcement\">{{cite news|last=Goodley|first=Simon|title=Nickelodeon signs Blackpool Pleasure Beach deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/27/nickelodeon-blackpool-pleasure-beach-deal|accessdate=28 September 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Official - Pleasure Beach Blackpool\">{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Land|url=http://www.nickelodeonland.com/|publisher=Pleasure Beach Blackpool|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> By mid-2011, [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] had closed their ''Nickelodeon Central'' and rethemed it to the generic [[Kid's World]] theme (it was later revealed that the park had struck a deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]]).<ref name=\"DW closure PR\" /><ref name=DreamWorks>{{cite web|title=Dreamworld Unveils Spectacular End of 2011: New World-Class Entertainment Alliance with DreamWorks Animation|url=http://about.dreamworld.com.au/Media-Centre/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Pages/DREAMWORLD-UNVEILS-SPECTACULAR-END-TO-2011.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=19 November 2011|date=10 November 2011}}</ref> In 2012, [[Universal's Superstar Parade]] had its first performance which features floats based on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and later opened a SpongeBob gift shop in Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone.

Nickelodeon attractions currently exist at [[Movie Park Germany]], [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], [[Mall of America]] and [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], as well as [[American Dream Meadowlands]]. Attractions previously existed at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Kings Island]], [[Universal Studios Florida]], [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[WhiteWater World]].\n\n==History==\nOn June 7, 1990, [[Universal Studios Florida]] opened with an attraction named [[Nickelodeon Studios]]. It was a television taping studio for the [[Cable channel|cable television channel]] Nickelodeon.\n\nIn 1995, ''[[Nickelodeon Splat City]]'' opened at three former [[Paramount Parks]]: [[California's Great America]], [[Kings Dominion]] and [[Kings Island]]. These attractions were inspired by the game shows that aired on the television network and generally involved slime. In 1999, Kings Dominion closed Nickelodeon Splat City in preparation for the opening of its 2000 attraction, Nickelodeon Central. ''Nickelodeon Central'' brought a retheme of many of the park's children's rides as well as the addition of new ones. Kings Island followed suit, closing its Splat City in 2000 and opening ''Nickelodeon Central'' in 2001. This area would later be expanded and renamed ''Nickelodeon Universe'' in 2006.\n\nIn 2002, Australian theme park [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] opened Nickelodeon Central.<ref name=\"Dreamworld History\">{{cite web|title=Dreamworld History|url=http://www.dreamworld.com.au/Schools/pdf/DW-Schools-History.pdf|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2003, ''Nickelodeon Central'' opened at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]] and [[Carowinds]], and [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]] opened in Universal Studios Florida. Expansions of these areas took place in 2005, 2006 and 2008 for Carowinds, Kings Island and Dreamworld, respectively. The Kings Island area was also renamed to ''Nickelodeon Universe'' at the same time. In 2007, Movie Park Germany opened a similar area entitled ''Nickland''. In 2007, it was announced that ''Nickelodeon Universe'' would be opening in [[Mall of America]] in 2008, replacing ''[[Camp Snoopy]]''. In 2009 and 2010, Cedar Fair terminated their contract with Nickelodeon resulting in all of the areas being rethemed to ''Planet Snoopy''. In early 2011, at a cost of {{Currency|10|GBP}} million, Pleasure Beach Blackpool opened ''Nickelodeon Land''.<ref name=\"PBB announcement\">{{cite news|last=Goodley|first=Simon|title=Nickelodeon signs Blackpool Pleasure Beach deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/27/nickelodeon-blackpool-pleasure-beach-deal|accessdate=28 September 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Official - Pleasure Beach Blackpool\">{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Land|url=http://www.nickelodeonland.com/|publisher=Pleasure Beach Blackpool|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> By mid-2011, [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] had closed their ''Nickelodeon Central'' and rethemed it to the generic [[Kid's World]] theme (it was later revealed that the park had struck a deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]]).<ref name=\"DW closure PR\" /><ref name=DreamWorks>{{cite web|title=Dreamworld Unveils Spectacular End of 2011: New World-Class Entertainment Alliance with DreamWorks Animation|url=http://about.dreamworld.com.au/Media-Centre/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Pages/DREAMWORLD-UNVEILS-SPECTACULAR-END-TO-2011.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=19 November 2011|date=10 November 2011}}</ref> In 2012, [[Universal's Superstar Parade]] had its first performance which features floats based on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and later opened a SpongeBob gift shop in Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone.

Unlike most Minecraft servers, the world map has never been reset, making it the oldest running map in the game.\n\n== Rules ==\nUnlike most other Minecraft servers, MinecraftOnline does not have block protection outside of the spawn region. Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n=== Rules ===\n\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n=== Grief ===\n'''Grief''' on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n=== '''Cheating''' ===\n'''Cheating''' on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n=== Spam ===\n'''Spam''' (including '''Flooding''') on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of speech ===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[Freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]]. \n\n== Hardware ==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4GHz.

It is produced by [[Swargachitra Appachan|Appachan]] under the banner of Swargachithra. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[N. N. Pillai]], [[Thilakan]], [[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]], [[Kanaka (actress)|Kanaka]], [[Jagadish]], [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]], [[Philomina]], [[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]], [[K. P. A. C.

The film was remade into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Peddarikam]]'' (1992) and into Marathi as ''Ghayaal'' (1993). In 2004, [[Priyadarshan]] remade the film in [[Hindi film|Hindi]]  as ''[[Hulchul (2004 film)|Hulchul]]''. It was again remade in [[Kannada film|Kannada]] as ''Pandavaru'' (2006).<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhkNMXPHW98</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAnjooran ([[N. N. Pillai]]), and his four sons Balaraman ([[Thilakan]]), Swaminathan ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]),  Premachandran ([[Bheeman Raghu]]) and Ramabhadran ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]) are in severe enmity with the Anappara family. Anjooran's bitter hatred toward Anappara Achamma ([[Philomina]]) stems from events in the past, when the men of Anappara abducted Balaraman's fianc\u00e9e and forced her to marry the eldest son of Achamma. The resulting series of events saw Anjooran's wife being killed, and him being sent to jail for avenging her by murdering Achamma's husband. Consequently, he develops a hatred toward all women, and their entry into his home is prohibited from then on.\n\nAnjooran's youngest son Ramabhadran is a law student. At college, he and his friend Mayin Kutty ([[Jagadish]]) try all means to humiliate their classmate Malu ([[Kanaka (actress)|Kanaka]]), who is the granddaughter of Achamma. Malu gets engaged to Shyam Prasad, a young state minister, but the minister withdraws from the relation as Anjooran intervenes and threatens him of political consequences. Incensed, Achamma hatches a plan to divide Anjooran's family by having Malu seduce Ramabhadran and making him turn against his father. When Malu expresses her feelings to Ramabhadran, as per the advice of her grandmother, Mayin Kutty ideates that Ramabhadran could divide the Anappara family by seducing Malu and turning her against them. On his advice, Ramabhadran too acts as if he is in love with her. The facade soon falls and they really fall in love with each other. While wondering about ways to get his family to support this relationship, he gets to know that Swaminathan is leading a secret double life as Ramanathan, with a wife Kochammini ([[K. P. A. C. Lalitha]]) and two kids. When confronted with this information, Swaminathan promises to help unite him and Malu.\n\nThrough a turn of events, Anjooran comes to know of Ramabhadran's love affair and Swaminathan's deceptiveness. Consequently, they're both ostracised from the family. Over at Anappara, Achamma is shocked to know that Malu's love is not a mere act. She and her sons decide to get her married to the family's advocate's son ([[Ravi Vallathol]]). However, she still tries to bring her plans to fruition by sending out signals that the house is divided over the issue. To this end, she sends her sons to beg for Anjooran's help in preventing Ramabhadran from marrying Malu (a request that Anjooran approves), and approaches Ramabhadran himself assuring him of all help in doing so.\n\nHowever, Achamma does not know that her youngest son Veerabhadran ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) is sympathetic to the lovers' cause and has revealed her plan to Ramabhadran. With his help, Ramabhadran sneaks in to the marriage hall and almost marries Malu. Enraged, Achamma curses Anjooran for not being vigilant enough, exposing her duplicity. Ramabhadran then admits that he sneaked in not to marry Malu, but to foil Achamma's plan and save his father's honour. A regretful Anjooran allows the wedding of Ramabhadran and Malu to take place and welcomes both him, Swaminathan and their families back into the fold, thereby paving the way for the entry of women into his house once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[N.

When Malu expresses her feelings to Ramabhadran, as per the advice of her grandmother, Mayin Kutty ideates that Ramabhadran could divide the Anappara family by seducing Malu and turning her against them. On his advice, Ramabhadran too acts as if he is in love with her. The facade soon falls and they really fall in love with each other. While wondering about ways to get his family to support this relationship, he gets to know that Swaminathan is leading a secret double life as Ramanathan, with a wife Kochammini ([[K. P. A. C. Lalitha]]) and two kids. When confronted with this information, Swaminathan promises to help unite him and Malu.\n\nThrough a turn of events, Anjooran comes to know of Ramabhadran's love affair and Swaminathan's deceptiveness. Consequently, they're both ostracised from the family. Over at Anappara, Achamma is shocked to know that Malu's love is not a mere act. She and her sons decide to get her married to the family's advocate's son ([[Ravi Vallathol]]). However, she still tries to bring her plans to fruition by sending out signals that the house is divided over the issue. To this end, she sends her sons to beg for Anjooran's help in preventing Ramabhadran from marrying Malu (a request that Anjooran approves), and approaches Ramabhadran himself assuring him of all help in doing so.\n\nHowever, Achamma does not know that her youngest son Veerabhadran ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) is sympathetic to the lovers' cause and has revealed her plan to Ramabhadran. With his help, Ramabhadran sneaks in to the marriage hall and almost marries Malu. Enraged, Achamma curses Anjooran for not being vigilant enough, exposing her duplicity. Ramabhadran then admits that he sneaked in not to marry Malu, but to foil Achamma's plan and save his father's honour. A regretful Anjooran allows the wedding of Ramabhadran and Malu to take place and welcomes both him, Swaminathan and their families back into the fold, thereby paving the way for the entry of women into his house once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[N.

They failed to get past the group stages on both occasions. Palestine's main venue is the [[Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium]] in [[Al-Ram]], however they have been forced to play in neutral stadiums for home matches in numerous occasions due to political issues.\n\nA football federation in [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]] was founded in 1928, although this was primarily the team of the Jewish residents. While a team for the Arab residents of Palestine played its first match in 1953, the national team was recognized by FIFA in 1998, after the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. The same year, Palestine played their first FIFA-recognized match in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]] in a friendly. The team has won the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup, thanks to a 1\u20130 win over the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] in the final. Their win in the competition qualified them to the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]], marking their first appearance in the competition. Palestine also qualified to the following edition of the Asian Cup, their first through regular qualification.\n\nThe Palestinian team is known by various nicknames: \"Lions of [[Canaan]]\" ({{Lang-ar|\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f \u0643\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0646}}), \"the [[Palestinian fedayeen|Fedayeen]]\" ({{Lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0648\u0646}}) and \"the Knights\" ({{Lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646}}). Their main colours are red and white.

[[association football]]. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Palestine is yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they have participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2015 AFC Asian Cup|2015]], after winning the [[2014 AFC Challenge Cup]], and [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019]], their first time through regular qualification. They failed to get past the group stages on both occasions. Palestine's main venue is the [[Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium]] in [[Al-Ram]], however they have been forced to play in neutral stadiums for home matches in numerous occasions due to political issues.\n\nA football federation in [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]] was founded in 1928, although this was primarily the team of the Jewish residents. While a team for the Arab residents of Palestine played its first match in 1953, the national team was recognized by FIFA in 1998, after the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. The same year, Palestine played their first FIFA-recognized match in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]] in a friendly. The team has won the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup, thanks to a 1\u20130 win over the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] in the final. Their win in the competition qualified them to the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]], marking their first appearance in the competition. Palestine also qualified to the following edition of the Asian Cup, their first through regular qualification.\n\nThe Palestinian team is known by various nicknames: \"Lions of [[Canaan]]\" ({{Lang-ar|\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f \u0643\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0646}}), \"the [[Palestinian fedayeen|Fedayeen]]\" ({{Lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0648\u0646}}) and \"the Knights\" ({{Lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646}}). Their main colours are red and white. The team reached an all-time high position of 73rd in the [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA ranking]] in February 2018 after going on a 12-match unbeaten streak, from 29 March 2016 to 22 March 2018.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1928\u20131998: The beginning ===\n[[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] leader [[Yosef Yekutieli]] attempted for Maccabi Association's membership in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as early as 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/44_the_coverage_of_sports_2.pdf|title=The Coverage of Sports News in \u201cFilastin\u201d 1911 \u2013 1948|last=Khalidi|first=Issam|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The application was turned down, as only associations representing states could be admitted as members.

Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program. All three co-founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community, but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and more toward an \"art community\". Many of the individuals involved with the initial development and promotion of DeviantArt still hold positions with the project, from administrators to volunteers serving as gallery directors and Message Network Administration.

The site flourished largely because of its unique offering and the contributions of its core member base and a team of volunteers after its launch,<ref name=\"spyed_journal\">{{cite web | url=http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/609173/ |title=spyed's DeviantArt Journal |author=Angelo Sotira |date=April 10, 2003 |accessdate=December 22, 2007}}</ref> but was officially incorporated in 2001 about eight months after launch.<ref name=\"tc_angelo_interview\">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/22/stop-being-weak-an-interview-with-angelo-sotira-ceo-of-deviantart-com-tctv/|title=TechCrunch|author=[[Cyan Banister]]}}</ref>\n\nDeviantArt was loosely inspired by projects like [[Winamp]] facelift, customize.org, deskmod.com, screenphuck.com, and skinz.org, all application skin-based websites. Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program. All three co-founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community, but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and more toward an \"art community\". Many of the individuals involved with the initial development and promotion of DeviantArt still hold positions with the project, from administrators to volunteers serving as gallery directors and Message Network Administration.

Historians used the period to identify Julian calendar years within which an event occurred when no such year was given in the historical record, or when the year given by previous historians was incorrect.<ref>Grafton 1975</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term ''Julian date'' may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the [[ordinal date]]) in the [[Gregorian calendar]], especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry,<ref name=\"usda\">USDA c. 1963.</ref> or it may refer to dates in the [[Julian calendar]]. For example, if a given \"Julian date\" is \"October 5, 1582\", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar\u2014the date it was first established).  Without an astronomical or historical context, a \"Julian date\" given as \"36\" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5.  Other possible meanings of a \"Julian date\" of \"36\" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD&nbsp;36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36&nbsp;astronomical [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]]).  This is why the terms \"ordinal date\" or \"day-of-year\" are preferred.  In contexts where a \"Julian date\" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called ''\"Julian calendars\"'',<ref name=\"usda\"/> but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.\n\nHistorically, Julian dates were recorded relative to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) (later, [[Ephemeris Time]]), but since 1997 the [[International Astronomical Union]] has recommended that Julian dates be specified in [[Terrestrial Time]].<ref>[https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Science/Recommendations/resolutionB1.html Resolution B1 on the use of Julian Dates] of the XXIIIrd International Astronomical Union General Assembly, Kyoto, Japan, 1997</ref> Seidelmann indicates that Julian dates may be used with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI), [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) and that the scale should be indicated when the difference is significant.<ref>Seidelmann 2013, p. 15.</ref> The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction.  Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as UTC, may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. [[leap second]]s).<ref name=\"IAU\" />\n\n== Variants ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (reference date)]] -->\nBecause the starting point or [[Epoch (reference date)|reference epoch]] is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.\n\nIn the table below, ''Epoch'' refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier.  JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of {{CURRENTDATE}} and may be cached.

Brown]]'s ''Tables of the Motion of the Moon'' (1919). This epoch was noon UT on [[:January 0]], 1900, which is the same as noon UT on December 31, 1899.

However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.\n\nAn error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the Geocentric Julian Day (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.\n\n== History ==\n===Julian Period===\nThe ''Julian day number'' is based on the ''Julian Period'' proposed by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]], a classical scholar, in 1583 (one year after the Gregorian calendar reform) as it is the product of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:\n\n: 28 ([[Solar cycle (calendar)|solar cycle]]) \u00d7 19 ([[Metonic cycle|lunar cycle]]) \u00d7 15 ([[indiction|indiction cycle]]) = 7980 years\n\nIts epoch occurs when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, {{nowrap|4713 BC}}, as {{nowrap|year 1}}, which was chosen to be before any historical record.<ref>Richards 2013, pp. 591\u2013592.</ref>\n\nScaliger corrected chronology by assigning each year a tricyclic \"character\", three numbers indicating that year's position in the 28-year solar cycle, the 19-year lunar cycle, and the 15-year indiction cycle. One or more of these numbers often appeared in the historical record alongside other pertinent facts without any mention of the Julian calendar year. The character of every year in the historical record was unique \u2013 it could only belong to one year in the 7980-year Julian Period. Scaliger determined that {{nowrap|1 BC or year 0}} was Julian Period {{nowrap|(JP) 4713}}. He knew that {{nowrap|1 BC or 0}} had the character 9 of the solar cycle, 1 of the lunar cycle, and 3 of the indiction cycle. By inspecting a 532-year Paschal cycle with 19 solar cycles (each year numbered 1\u201328) and 28 lunar cycles (each year numbered 1\u201319), he determined that the first two numbers, 9 and 1, occurred at its year 457. He then calculated via [[modulo operation|remainder division]] that he needed to add eight 532-year Paschal cycles totaling 4256 years before the cycle containing {{nowrap|1 BC or 0}} in order for its year 457 to be indiction 3. The sum {{nowrap|4256 + 457}} was thus {{no wrap|JP 4713}}.<ref>Grafton 1975, p. 184</ref>\n\nA formula for determining the year of the Julian Period given its character involving three four-digit numbers was published by [[Jacques de Billy]] in 1665 in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' (its first year).<ref>de Billy 1665</ref> [[John Herschel|John F.

Thus 7980{{nbs}}years must be subtracted from it to yield the first year of the present Julian Period, \u22124712 or 4713{{nbs}}BC, when all three of its sub-cycles are in their first years.\n\nScaliger got the idea of using a tricyclic period from \"the Greeks of Constantinople\" as Herschel stated in his quotation below in [[#Julian day numbers|Julian day numbers]].<ref>Herschel 1849, p. 634</ref> Specifically, the monk and priest Georgios wrote in 638/39 that the Byzantine year 6149 AM (640/41) had indiction 14, lunar cycle 12, and solar cycle 17, which places the first year of the [[Byzantine Era]] in 5509/08{{nbs}}BC, the Byzantine Creation.<ref>Diekamp 44, 45, 50</ref> Dionysius Exiguus called the Byzantine lunar cycle his \"lunar cycle\" in argumentum 6, in contrast with the Alexandrian lunar cycle which he called his \"nineteen-year cycle\" in argumentum 5.<ref>Dionysius Exiguus 2003/525</ref>\n\nAlthough many references say that the ''Julian'' in \"Julian Period\" refers to Scaliger's father, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Julius Scaliger]], at the beginning of Book V of his ''{{lang|la|Opus de Emendatione Temporum}}'' (\"Work on the Emendation of Time\") he states, \"''{{lang|la|Iulianam vocauimus: quia ad annum Iulianum accomodata}}''\",<ref>Scaliger 1629, p. 361</ref>{{refn|Scaliger used these words in his 1629 edition on p. 361 and in his 1598 edition on p. 339.

Herschel]] then developed them for astronomical use in his 1849 ''Outlines of Astronomy'', after acknowledging that Ideler was his guide.<ref>Herschel, 1849, p. 632 note</ref>\n\n{{quote |text=The period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology.<ref>Ideler 1825, p. 77</ref> We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year {{nowrap|4713 BC}}, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.<ref>Herschel 1849, p. 634</ref>}}\n\nAt least one mathematical [[astronomer]] adopted Herschel's \"days of the Julian period\" immediately. [[Benjamin Peirce]] of [[Harvard University]] used over 2,800 Julian days in his ''Tables of the Moon'', begun in 1849 but not published until 1853, to calculate the lunar [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] in the new ''American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' from 1855 to 1888. The days are specified for \"Washington mean noon\", with Greenwich defined as {{nowrap|18{{sup|h}} 51{{sup|m}} 48{{sup|s}}}} west of Washington (282\u00b057\u2032W, or Washington 77\u00b03\u2032W of Greenwich). A table with 197 Julian days (\"Date in Mean Solar Days\", one per century mostly) was included for the years \u20134713 to 2000 with no year 0, thus \"\u2013\" means BC, including decimal fractions for hours, minutes and seconds.<ref>Peirce 1853</ref> The same table appears in ''Tables of Mercury'' by Joseph Winlock, without any other Julian days.<ref>Winlock 1864</ref>\n\nThe national ephemerides started to include a multi-year table of Julian days, under various names, for either every year or every leap year beginning with the French ''Connaissance des Temps'' in 1870 for 2,620 years, increasing in 1899 to 3,000 years.<ref>''Connaissance des Temps'' 1870, pp. 419\u2013424; 1899, pp. 718\u2013722</ref> The British ''Nautical Almanac'' began in 1879 with 2,000 years.<ref>''Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'' 1879, p. 494</ref> The ''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'' began in 1899 with 2,000 years.<ref>''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'' 1899, pp. 390\u2013391</ref> The ''American Ephemeris'' was the last to add a multi-year table, in 1925 with 2,000 years.<ref>''American Ephemeris'' 1925, pp. 746\u2013749</ref> However, it was the first to include any mention of Julian days with one for the year of issue beginning in 1855, as well as later scattered sections with many days in the year of issue. It was also the first to use the name \"Julian day number\" in 1918. The ''Nautical Almanac'' began in 1866 to include a Julian day for every day in the year of issue. The ''Connaissance des Temps'' began in 1871 to include a Julian day for every day in the year of issue.\n\nThe French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, ''{{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste}}'', in 1823.<ref>Laplace 1823</ref> Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into [[variable star]] work in 1860 by the English astronomer [[N. R. Pogson|Norman Pogson]], which he stated was at the suggestion of John Herschel.<ref>Pogson 1860</ref> They were popularized for variable stars by [[Edward Charles Pickering]], of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], in 1890.<ref>Furness 1915.</ref>\n\nJulian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the [[astronomical day]] began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since [[Ptolemy]] chose to begin the days for his astronomical observations at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using [[water clock]]s. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]] days beginning at sunrise and [[Babylonia]]n days beginning at sunset.<ref>Ptolemy c. 150, p. 12</ref> Medieval Muslim astronomers used days beginning at sunset, so astronomical days beginning at noon did produce a single date for an entire night. Later medieval European astronomers used Roman days beginning at midnight so astronomical days beginning at noon also allow observations during an entire night to use a single date. When all astronomers decided to start their astronomical days at midnight to conform to the beginning of the civil day, on {{nowrap|January 1, 1925}}, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice, beginning at noon.\n\nDuring this period, usage of Julian Day Numbers as a neutral intermediary when converting a date in one calendar into a date in another calendar also occurred. An isolated use was by Ebenezer Burgess in his 1860 ''Translation of the [[Surya Siddhanta]]'' wherein he stated that the beginning of the [[Kali Yuga]] era occurred at midnight at the meridian of [[Ujjain]] at the end of the 588,465th day and the beginning of the 588,466th day (civil reckoning) of the Julian Period, or between {{nowrap|17 and 18 February}} {{nowrap|JP 1612}} or {{nowrap|3102 BC}}.<ref>Burgess 1860</ref><ref>Burgess was furnished these Julian days by US Nautical Alamanac Office.</ref> Robert Schram was notable beginning with his 1882 ''Hilfstafeln f\u00fcr Chronologie''.<ref>Schram 1882</ref> Here he used about 5,370 \"days of the Julian Period\". He greatly expanded his usage of Julian days in his 1908 ''Kalendariographische und Chronologische Tafeln'' containing over 530,000 Julian days, one for the zeroth day of every month over thousands of years in many calendars. He included over 25,000 negative Julian days, given in a positive form by adding 10,000,000 to each. He called them \"day of the Julian Period\", \"Julian day\", or simply \"day\" in his discussion, but no name was used in the tables.<ref>Schram 1908</ref> Continuing this tradition, Richards uses Julian day numbers to convert dates from one calendar into another using algorithms rather than tables.<ref>Richards 1998, pp. 287\u2013342</ref>\n\n== Julian day number calculation ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Gregorian calendar]] -->\nThe Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas ([[integer division]] rounding towards zero is used exclusively, that is, positive values are rounded down and negative values are rounded up):\n\n''The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12.

Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive [[leap second]] contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the [[SOFA (astronomy)|Standards of Fundamental Astronomy]] (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as \"quasi-JD\".<ref>\"SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools\" 2016, p. 20</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=50em}}\n* [[Julian year (calendar)]]\n* [[5th millennium BC]]\n* [[Barycentric Julian Date]]\n* [[Dual dating]]\n* [[Decimal time]]\n* [[Epoch (astronomy)]]\n* [[Epoch (reference date)]]\n* [[Era]]\n* [[J2000]] \u2013 the epoch that starts on JD 2451545.0 (TT), the standard epoch used in astronomy since 1984\n* [[Lunation Number]] (similar concept)\n* [[Ordinal date]]\n* [[Time]]\n* [[Time standard]]s\n* [[Zeller's congruence]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Alsted, Johann Heinrich 1649 [1630].

Astronomical calculations generally include a year 0, so these dates should be adjusted accordingly (i.e. the year 4713 BC becomes [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical year number]] &minus;4712, etc.). In this article, dates before October 15, 1582 are in the (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar and dates on or after October 15, 1582 are in the Gregorian calendar, unless otherwise labelled.</ref> For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 [[Universal Time|UT]]  (noon) on January 1, 2000, was 2&nbsp;451&nbsp;545.<ref>McCarthy & Guinot 2013, 91\u20132</ref>\n\nThe Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.<ref name=\"IAU\">\"Resolution B1\" 1997.</ref> For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2&nbsp;456&nbsp;293.520&nbsp;833.<ref>US Naval Observatory 2005</ref> Expressed as a Julian date, right now it is {{#expr:{{#time:U/86400+2440587.5}}}}. <small>[{{Purge|refresh}}]</small>\n\nThe Julian Period is a [[Chronology|chronological]] interval of 7980 years; year 1 of the Julian Period was {{nowrap|4713 BC (\u22124712)}}.<ref>''Astronomical Almanac for the year 2017'' p. B4, which states 2017 is year 6730 of the Julian Period.</ref> The Julian calendar year {{CURRENTYEAR}} is year {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} + 4713 }} of the current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year {{nowrap|AD 3268}}. Historians used the period to identify Julian calendar years within which an event occurred when no such year was given in the historical record, or when the year given by previous historians was incorrect.<ref>Grafton 1975</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term ''Julian date'' may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the [[ordinal date]]) in the [[Gregorian calendar]], especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry,<ref name=\"usda\">USDA c. 1963.</ref> or it may refer to dates in the [[Julian calendar]]. For example, if a given \"Julian date\" is \"October 5, 1582\", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar\u2014the date it was first established).  Without an astronomical or historical context, a \"Julian date\" given as \"36\" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5.  Other possible meanings of a \"Julian date\" of \"36\" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD&nbsp;36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36&nbsp;astronomical [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]]).  This is why the terms \"ordinal date\" or \"day-of-year\" are preferred.  In contexts where a \"Julian date\" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called ''\"Julian calendars\"'',<ref name=\"usda\"/> but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.\n\nHistorically, Julian dates were recorded relative to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) (later, [[Ephemeris Time]]), but since 1997 the [[International Astronomical Union]] has recommended that Julian dates be specified in [[Terrestrial Time]].<ref>[https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Science/Recommendations/resolutionB1.html Resolution B1 on the use of Julian Dates] of the XXIIIrd International Astronomical Union General Assembly, Kyoto, Japan, 1997</ref> Seidelmann indicates that Julian dates may be used with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI), [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) and that the scale should be indicated when the difference is significant.<ref>Seidelmann 2013, p. 15.</ref> The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction.  Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as UTC, may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. [[leap second]]s).<ref name=\"IAU\" />\n\n== Variants ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (reference date)]] -->\nBecause the starting point or [[Epoch (reference date)|reference epoch]] is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.\n\nIn the table below, ''Epoch'' refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier.  JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of {{CURRENTDATE}} and may be cached.

(NASA codes PB-1\u2014PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year count.) Only whole days are represented.  Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day, plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields.

However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.\n\nAn error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the Geocentric Julian Day (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.\n\n== History ==\n===Julian Period===\nThe ''Julian day number'' is based on the ''Julian Period'' proposed by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]], a classical scholar, in 1583 (one year after the Gregorian calendar reform) as it is the product of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:\n\n: 28 ([[Solar cycle (calendar)|solar cycle]]) \u00d7 19 ([[Metonic cycle|lunar cycle]]) \u00d7 15 ([[indiction|indiction cycle]]) = 7980 years\n\nIts epoch occurs when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, {{nowrap|4713 BC}}, as {{nowrap|year 1}}, which was chosen to be before any historical record.<ref>Richards 2013, pp. 591\u2013592.</ref>\n\nScaliger corrected chronology by assigning each year a tricyclic \"character\", three numbers indicating that year's position in the 28-year solar cycle, the 19-year lunar cycle, and the 15-year indiction cycle. One or more of these numbers often appeared in the historical record alongside other pertinent facts without any mention of the Julian calendar year. The character of every year in the historical record was unique \u2013 it could only belong to one year in the 7980-year Julian Period. Scaliger determined that {{nowrap|1 BC or year 0}} was Julian Period {{nowrap|(JP) 4713}}. He knew that {{nowrap|1 BC or 0}} had the character 9 of the solar cycle, 1 of the lunar cycle, and 3 of the indiction cycle. By inspecting a 532-year Paschal cycle with 19 solar cycles (each year numbered 1\u201328) and 28 lunar cycles (each year numbered 1\u201319), he determined that the first two numbers, 9 and 1, occurred at its year 457. He then calculated via [[modulo operation|remainder division]] that he needed to add eight 532-year Paschal cycles totaling 4256 years before the cycle containing {{nowrap|1 BC or 0}} in order for its year 457 to be indiction 3. The sum {{nowrap|4256 + 457}} was thus {{no wrap|JP 4713}}.<ref>Grafton 1975, p. 184</ref>\n\nA formula for determining the year of the Julian Period given its character involving three four-digit numbers was published by [[Jacques de Billy]] in 1665 in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' (its first year).<ref>de Billy 1665</ref> [[John Herschel|John F. W.

Thus 7980{{nbs}}years must be subtracted from it to yield the first year of the present Julian Period, \u22124712 or 4713{{nbs}}BC, when all three of its sub-cycles are in their first years.\n\nScaliger got the idea of using a tricyclic period from \"the Greeks of Constantinople\" as Herschel stated in his quotation below in [[#Julian day numbers|Julian day numbers]].<ref>Herschel 1849, p. 634</ref> Specifically, the monk and priest Georgios wrote in 638/39 that the Byzantine year 6149 AM (640/41) had indiction 14, lunar cycle 12, and solar cycle 17, which places the first year of the [[Byzantine Era]] in 5509/08{{nbs}}BC, the Byzantine Creation.<ref>Diekamp 44, 45, 50</ref> Dionysius Exiguus called the Byzantine lunar cycle his \"lunar cycle\" in argumentum 6, in contrast with the Alexandrian lunar cycle which he called his \"nineteen-year cycle\" in argumentum 5.<ref>Dionysius Exiguus 2003/525</ref>\n\nAlthough many references say that the ''Julian'' in \"Julian Period\" refers to Scaliger's father, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Julius Scaliger]], at the beginning of Book V of his ''{{lang|la|Opus de Emendatione Temporum}}'' (\"Work on the Emendation of Time\") he states, \"''{{lang|la|Iulianam vocauimus: quia ad annum Iulianum accomodata}}''\",<ref>Scaliger 1629, p. 361</ref>{{refn|Scaliger used these words in his 1629 edition on p. 361 and in his 1598 edition on p. 339.

The Christian day (1721425) was current, not elapsed.}} [[John Herschel|John F. W. Herschel]] then developed them for astronomical use in his 1849 ''Outlines of Astronomy'', after acknowledging that Ideler was his guide.<ref>Herschel, 1849, p. 632 note</ref>\n\n{{quote |text=The period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology.<ref>Ideler 1825, p. 77</ref> We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year {{nowrap|4713 BC}}, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.<ref>Herschel 1849, p. 634</ref>}}\n\nAt least one mathematical [[astronomer]] adopted Herschel's \"days of the Julian period\" immediately. [[Benjamin Peirce]] of [[Harvard University]] used over 2,800 Julian days in his ''Tables of the Moon'', begun in 1849 but not published until 1853, to calculate the lunar [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] in the new ''American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' from 1855 to 1888. The days are specified for \"Washington mean noon\", with Greenwich defined as {{nowrap|18{{sup|h}} 51{{sup|m}} 48{{sup|s}}}} west of Washington (282\u00b057\u2032W, or Washington 77\u00b03\u2032W of Greenwich). A table with 197 Julian days (\"Date in Mean Solar Days\", one per century mostly) was included for the years \u20134713 to 2000 with no year 0, thus \"\u2013\" means BC, including decimal fractions for hours, minutes and seconds.<ref>Peirce 1853</ref> The same table appears in ''Tables of Mercury'' by Joseph Winlock, without any other Julian days.<ref>Winlock 1864</ref>\n\nThe national ephemerides started to include a multi-year table of Julian days, under various names, for either every year or every leap year beginning with the French ''Connaissance des Temps'' in 1870 for 2,620 years, increasing in 1899 to 3,000 years.<ref>''Connaissance des Temps'' 1870, pp. 419\u2013424; 1899, pp. 718\u2013722</ref> The British ''Nautical Almanac'' began in 1879 with 2,000 years.<ref>''Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'' 1879, p. 494</ref> The ''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'' began in 1899 with 2,000 years.<ref>''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'' 1899, pp. 390\u2013391</ref> The ''American Ephemeris'' was the last to add a multi-year table, in 1925 with 2,000 years.<ref>''American Ephemeris'' 1925, pp. 746\u2013749</ref> However, it was the first to include any mention of Julian days with one for the year of issue beginning in 1855, as well as later scattered sections with many days in the year of issue. It was also the first to use the name \"Julian day number\" in 1918. The ''Nautical Almanac'' began in 1866 to include a Julian day for every day in the year of issue. The ''Connaissance des Temps'' began in 1871 to include a Julian day for every day in the year of issue.\n\nThe French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, ''{{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste}}'', in 1823.<ref>Laplace 1823</ref> Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into [[variable star]] work in 1860 by the English astronomer [[N. R. Pogson|Norman Pogson]], which he stated was at the suggestion of John Herschel.<ref>Pogson 1860</ref> They were popularized for variable stars by [[Edward Charles Pickering]], of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], in 1890.<ref>Furness 1915.</ref>\n\nJulian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the [[astronomical day]] began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since [[Ptolemy]] chose to begin the days for his astronomical observations at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using [[water clock]]s. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]] days beginning at sunrise and [[Babylonia]]n days beginning at sunset.<ref>Ptolemy c. 150, p. 12</ref> Medieval Muslim astronomers used days beginning at sunset, so astronomical days beginning at noon did produce a single date for an entire night. Later medieval European astronomers used Roman days beginning at midnight so astronomical days beginning at noon also allow observations during an entire night to use a single date. When all astronomers decided to start their astronomical days at midnight to conform to the beginning of the civil day, on {{nowrap|January 1, 1925}}, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice, beginning at noon.\n\nDuring this period, usage of Julian Day Numbers as a neutral intermediary when converting a date in one calendar into a date in another calendar also occurred. An isolated use was by Ebenezer Burgess in his 1860 ''Translation of the [[Surya Siddhanta]]'' wherein he stated that the beginning of the [[Kali Yuga]] era occurred at midnight at the meridian of [[Ujjain]] at the end of the 588,465th day and the beginning of the 588,466th day (civil reckoning) of the Julian Period, or between {{nowrap|17 and 18 February}} {{nowrap|JP 1612}} or {{nowrap|3102 BC}}.<ref>Burgess 1860</ref><ref>Burgess was furnished these Julian days by US Nautical Alamanac Office.</ref> Robert Schram was notable beginning with his 1882 ''Hilfstafeln f\u00fcr Chronologie''.<ref>Schram 1882</ref> Here he used about 5,370 \"days of the Julian Period\". He greatly expanded his usage of Julian days in his 1908 ''Kalendariographische und Chronologische Tafeln'' containing over 530,000 Julian days, one for the zeroth day of every month over thousands of years in many calendars. He included over 25,000 negative Julian days, given in a positive form by adding 10,000,000 to each. He called them \"day of the Julian Period\", \"Julian day\", or simply \"day\" in his discussion, but no name was used in the tables.<ref>Schram 1908</ref> Continuing this tradition, Richards uses Julian day numbers to convert dates from one calendar into another using algorithms rather than tables.<ref>Richards 1998, pp. 287\u2013342</ref>\n\n== Julian day number calculation ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Gregorian calendar]] -->\nThe Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas ([[integer division]] rounding towards zero is used exclusively, that is, positive values are rounded down and negative values are rounded up):\n\n''The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12.

Divisions are integer divisions, fractional parts are ignored.\n\nJDN = 367 \u00d7 Y \u2212 (7 \u00d7 (Y + 5001 + (M \u2212 9)/7))/4 + (275 \u00d7 M)/9 + D + 1729777\n\n=== Finding Julian date given Julian day number and time of day ===\nFor the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following.

''e'' = ''r'' \u00d7 ''f'' + ''v''\n:3. ''g'' = mod(''e'', ''p'') div ''r''\n:4. ''h'' = ''u'' \u00d7 ''g'' + ''w''\n:5. '''D''' = (mod(''h, s'')) div ''u'' + 1\n:6.

Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive [[leap second]] contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the [[SOFA (astronomy)|Standards of Fundamental Astronomy]] (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as \"quasi-JD\".<ref>\"SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools\" 2016, p. 20</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=50em}}\n* [[Julian year (calendar)]]\n* [[5th millennium BC]]\n* [[Barycentric Julian Date]]\n* [[Dual dating]]\n* [[Decimal time]]\n* [[Epoch (astronomy)]]\n* [[Epoch (reference date)]]\n* [[Era]]\n* [[J2000]] \u2013 the epoch that starts on JD 2451545.0 (TT), the standard epoch used in astronomy since 1984\n* [[Lunation Number]] (similar concept)\n* [[Ordinal date]]\n* [[Time]]\n* [[Time standard]]s\n* [[Zeller's congruence]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Alsted, Johann Heinrich 1649 [1630].

Aircraft routes are planned to avoid [[restricted airspace]] and dangerous areas, and to pass near navigation [[beacon]]s.\n\n==Satellite ground tracks==\nThe ground track of a satellite can take a number of different forms, depending on the values of the [[orbital elements]], parameters which define the size, shape, and orientation of the satellite's orbit. (This article discusses closed orbits, or orbits with [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] less than one, and thus excludes [[parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] and [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] trajectories.)\n\n===Direct and retrograde motion===\nTypically, satellites have a roughly [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] ground track.  A satellite with an orbital [[inclination]] between zero and ninety degrees is said to be in what is called a ''direct'' or ''[[prograde orbit]]'', meaning that it orbits in the same direction as the Earth's rotation.  A satellite with an orbital inclination between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 (or, equivalently, between -90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0) is said to be in a ''[[retrograde orbit]]''. (Direct orbits are by far the most common for artificial satellites, as the initial velocity imparted by the Earth's rotation at launch reduces the [[delta-v]] needed to achieve orbit.)\n\nA satellite in a direct orbit with an [[orbital period]] less than one day will tend to move from west to east along its ground track. This is called \"apparent direct\" motion. A satellite in a direct orbit with an orbital period ''greater'' than one day will tend to move from east to west along its ground track, in what is called \"apparent retrograde\" motion. This effect occurs because the satellite orbits more slowly than the speed at which the Earth rotates beneath it. Any satellite in a true retrograde orbit will always move from east to west along its ground track, regardless of the length of its orbital period.\n\nBecause a satellite in an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit moves faster near perigee and slower near apogee, it is possible for a satellite to track eastward during part of its orbit and westward during another part. This phenomenon allows for ground tracks which cross over themselves, as in the geosynchronous and Molniya orbits discussed below.\n\n===Effect of orbital period===\n[[File:Geostationary orbit-animation.gif|thumb|200px|A [[geostationary]] orbit, as viewed from above the North Pole]]\nA satellite whose orbital period is an [[integer]] fraction of a day (e.g., 24 hours, 12 hours, 8 hours, etc.) will follow roughly the same ground track every day. This ground track is shifted east or west depending on the [[longitude of the ascending node]], which can vary over time due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of the orbit. If the period of the satellite is slightly longer than an integer fraction of a day, the ground track will shift west over time; if it is slightly shorter, the ground track will shift east.<ref name = curtis/><ref name = monty>{{Citation\n  | last = Montenbruck\n  | first = Oliver\n  | last2 = Gill\n  | first2 = Eberhard \n  | title = Satellite Orbits\n  | place = The Netherlands\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | year = 2000\n  | volume = \n  | edition = 1st\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 3-540-67280-X }}.</ref>\n\nAs the orbital period of a satellite increases, approaching the [[Earth rotation|rotational period of the Earth]] (in other words, as its average orbital speed slows towards the rotational speed of the Earth), its sinusoidal ground track will become compressed longitudinally, meaning that the \"nodes\" (the points at which it crosses the [[equator]]) will become closer together, until at geosynchronous orbit they lie directly on top of each other. For orbital periods ''longer'' than the Earth's rotational period, an increase in orbital period corresponds to a longitudinal stretching out of the (apparent retrograde) ground track.\n\nA satellite whose orbital period is ''equal'' to the rotational period of the Earth is said to be in a [[geosynchronous orbit]]. Its ground track will have a \"figure eight\" shape over a fixed location on the Earth, crossing the equator twice each day.  It will track eastward when it is on the part of its orbit closest to [[perigee]], and westward when it is closest to [[apogee]].\n\nA special case of the geosynchronous orbit, the [[geostationary orbit]], has an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentrity]] of zero (meaning the orbit is circular), and an inclination of zero in the [[ECEF|Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate system]] (meaning the orbital plane is not tilted relative to the Earth's equator).  The \"ground track\" in this case consists of a single point on the Earth's equator, above which the satellite sits at all times. Note that the satellite is still orbiting the Earth \u2014 its apparent lack of motion is due to the fact that the Earth is rotating about its own [[center of mass]] at the same rate as the satellite is orbiting.\n\n===Effect of inclination===\nOrbital [[inclination]] is the angle formed between the plane of an orbit and the equatorial plane of the Earth. The geographic [[latitude]]s covered by the ground track will range from ''\u2013i'' to ''i'', where ''i'' is the orbital inclination.<ref name = monty/> In other words, the greater the inclination of a satellite's orbit, the further north and south its ground track will pass. A satellite with an inclination of exactly 90\u00b0 is said to be in a [[polar orbit]], meaning it passes over the Earth's north and south [[Geographical pole|poles]].\n\n[[Rocket launch|Launch]] sites at lower latitudes are often preferred partly for the flexibility they allow in orbital inclination; the initial inclination of an orbit is constrained to be greater than or equal to the launch latitude. Vehicles launched from [[Cape Canaveral]], for instance, must have an initial orbital inclination of at least 28\u00b027\u2032, the latitude of the launch site\u2014and to achieve this minimum requires launching with a due east [[azimuth]], which may not always be feasible given other launch constraints. At the extremes, a launch site located on the equator can launch directly into any desired inclination, while a hypothetical launch site at the north or south pole would only be able to launch into polar orbits. (While it is possible to perform an [[orbital inclination change]] maneuver once on orbit, such maneuvers are typically among the most costly, in terms of fuel, of all orbital maneuvers, and are typically avoided or minimized to the extent possible.)\n\nIn addition to providing for a wider range of initial orbit inclinations, low-latitude launch sites offer the benefit of requiring less energy to make orbit (at least for prograde orbits, which comprise the vast majority of launches), due to the initial velocity provided by the Earth's rotation. The desire for equatorial launch sites, coupled with geopolitical and logistical realities, has fostered the development of floating launch platforms, most notably [[Sea Launch]].\n\n===Effect of argument of perigee===\n[[Image:Molniya.jpg|thumb|400px|The ground track of a Molniya orbit]]\nIf the [[Argument of periapsis|argument of perigee]] is zero, meaning that perigee and apogee lie in the equatorial plane, then the ground track of the satellite will appear the same above and below the equator (i.e., it will exhibit 180\u00b0 [[rotational symmetry]] about the [[orbital node]]s.)  If the argument of perigee is non-zero, however, the satellite will behave differently in the northern and southern hemispheres. The [[Molniya orbit]], with an argument of perigee near \u221290\u00b0, is an example of such a case.  In a Molniya orbit, apogee occurs at a high [[latitude]] (63\u00b0), and the orbit is highly eccentric (''e'' = 0.72).  This causes the satellite to \"hover\" over a region of the northern hemisphere for a long time, while spending very little time over the southern hemisphere. This phenomenon is known as \"apogee dwell\", and is desirable for communications for high latitude regions.<ref name = monty/>\n\n===Repeat orbits===\nAs often times orbital operations are required to monitor a specific location on earth, orbits that cover the same ground track periodically are often used. On earth, these orbits are commonly referred to as Earth-repeat orbits. These orbits use the [[nodal precession]] effect to shift the orbit so the ground track coincides with that of a previous revolution, so that this essentially balances out the offset in the revolution of the orbited body. The longitudinal rotation after a certain period of time of a planet is given by:\n:<math>\\Delta L_1 = -2 \\pi \\frac{T}{T_E}</math>\nwhere\n*<math>T</math> is the time elapsed\n*<math>T_E</math> is the time for a full revolution of the orbiting body, in the case of Earth one [[Sidereal time|Sidereal day]]\n\nThe effect of the [[nodal precession]] can be quantified as:\n:<math>\\Delta L_2 = - \\frac{3 \\pi J_2 R_e^2 cos(i)}{a^2(1-e^2)^2}</math>\nwhere\n*<math>J_2</math> is the body's [[Nodal precession#Equation|second dynamic form factor]]\n*<math>R_e</math> is the body's radius\n*<math>i</math> is the [[orbital inclination]]\n*<math>a</math> is the orbit's [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]]\n*<math>e</math> is the [[orbital eccentricity]]\n\nThese two effects must cancel out after a set <math>j</math> orbital revolutions and <math>k</math> (sidereal) days. Hence, equating the elapsed time to the orbital period of the satellite and combining the above two equations yields an equation which holds for any orbit that is a repeat orbit:\n:<math>j\\left| \\Delta L_1 + \\Delta L_2 \\right| = j\\left|-2 \\pi \\frac{2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{\\mu}}}{T_E} - \\frac{3 \\pi J_2 R_e^2 cos(i)}{a^2(1-e^2)^2} \\right| = k 2 \\pi</math>\nwhere\n*<math>\\mu</math> is the [[Standard gravitational parameter]] for the body being orbited\n*<math>j</math> is the number of orbital revolutions after which the same ground track is covered\n*<math>k</math> is the number of [[sidereal time|sidereal days]] after which the same ground track is covered\n\n==See also==\n*[[Course (navigation)]]\n*[[Pass (spaceflight)]], the period in which a spacecraft is visible above the local horizon\n*[[Terminator (solar)]], the moving line that separates the illuminated day side and the dark night side of a planetary body\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* Lyle, S. and Capderou, Michel (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lZWZXbOKZvEC&pg=PA215 ''Satellites: Orbits and Missions''] Springer {{ISBN|9782287274695}} pp 175-264\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150215054856/http://orbits.eoportal.org/ Satellite Tracker] at eoPortal.org\n*[http://www.satview.org/ satview.org]\n*[http://www.heavens-above.com/ heavens-above.com]\n*[https://isstracker.pl https://isstracker.pl] ISS Tracker \n*[http://smallsats.org/2013/01/20/satellite-ground-track-gps-bii-10/ satellite ground track] software code at smallsats.org\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140728022056/http://www.infosatellites.com/ infosatellites.com]\n*[http://www.n2yo.com/ n2yo.com]\n\n{{orbits}}\n\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|path on the surface of the Earth or another body directly below an aircraft or satellite}}\n[[Image:Iss ground track.JPG|thumb|400px|Ground track of the [[International Space Station]] for approximately two [[orbital period|periods]].

Five years later, during a respite in the war, he presided over the Cathar synod at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pieusse]] where about a hundred Perfects had assembled. During the meeting, it was decided to create the bishopric of [[Razes]].

Yet Guilhabert himself seems to have been one of the greatest personalities of thirteenth-century France. The history of the deeds and actions of these persecuted apostles may well have proved as rich in inspiration and instruction as that of a Francis of Assisi: They too were messengers of God's love. It is not immaterial to recall that these torches were put out forever, their faces obliterated and their example lost to all those whose lives they might have guided during the centuries that followed. </blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Esclarmonde of Foix]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Catharism]]\n[[Category:People of the Albigensian Crusade]]\n[[Category:1240 deaths]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n", "name_user": "Jmg38", "label": "safe", "comment": "9-year-old redlinks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilhabert_de_Castres"}
