He discovered the cause of [[Hirschsprung's disease]] and in 1948, with Alexander Bill, performed the first pull-through operation in a child with [[megacolon]], which then became a treatment for the disease.\n\nInitially a resident in [[pathology]], he soon became an assistant professor of [[pediatric surgery]] at Harvard and later moved to Boston's [[Floating Hospital for Children]] as surgeon-in-chief, where he was the first pediatric surgeon on the staff at the hospital and where he began his research in Hirschsprung's disease. Subsequently he became surgeon-in-chief of [[Lurie Children's Hospital|Children's Memorial Hospital]], where he remained until his retirement in 1973.\n\nIn 1973, Swenson was elected president of the [[American Pediatric Surgical Association]]. He authored ''Swenson's Pediatric Surgery'', which ran into five editions and he was the recipient of a number of awards including the [[E. Mead Johnson Award]], the [[William E. Ladd]] Medal and the [[Denis Browne (surgeon)|Denis Browne]] Gold Medal.\n\n==Early life==\nSwenson was born in [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, in 1909. His parents, Amanda and Carl Albert Swenson, were missionaries for the [[Community of Christ]] and relocated their family to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri, in 1917. Both parents died when Orvar was a teenager, and he and his brother Alvin lived in a boarding house where they started a business, Woodcraft, which sold fire-by-friction sets, bows and arrows, and field hockey sticks.

He discovered the cause of [[Hirschsprung's disease]] and in 1948, with Alexander Bill, performed the first pull-through operation in a child with [[megacolon]], which then became a treatment for the disease.\n\nInitially a resident in [[pathology]], he soon became an assistant professor of [[pediatric surgery]] at Harvard and later moved to Boston's [[Floating Hospital for Children]] as surgeon-in-chief, where he was the first pediatric surgeon on the staff at the hospital and where he began his research in Hirschsprung's disease. Subsequently he became surgeon-in-chief of [[Lurie Children's Hospital|Children's Memorial Hospital]], where he remained until his retirement in 1973.\n\nIn 1973, Swenson was elected president of the [[American Pediatric Surgical Association]]. He authored ''Swenson's Pediatric Surgery'', which ran into five editions and he was the recipient of a number of awards including the [[E. Mead Johnson Award]], the [[William E. Ladd]] Medal and the [[Denis Browne (surgeon)|Denis Browne]] Gold Medal.\n\n==Early life==\nSwenson was born in [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, in 1909. His parents, Amanda and Carl Albert Swenson, were missionaries for the [[Community of Christ]] and relocated their family to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri, in 1917. Both parents died when Orvar was a teenager, and he and his brother Alvin lived in a boarding house where they started a business, Woodcraft, which sold fire-by-friction sets, bows and arrows, and field hockey sticks. Orvar graduated from [[William Chrisman High School]] in 1929 and [[William Jewell College]] in 1933.<ref name=\"apsa\">{{Cite web|url=https://eapsa.org/apsa-info/about-us/in-memoriam/dr-orvar-swenson/|title=Dr. Orvar Swenson|publisher=[[American Pediatric Surgical Association]]|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref> The same year, Orvar and Alvin were admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]], where they successfully petitioned the dean to be placed in the same class so that they could share textbooks in order to save money.<ref name=\"jps1\">{{cite journal|last=Raffensperger|first=John G.|title=Orvar Swenson, MD, 1909-2012|url=https://www.jpedsurg.org/article/S0022-3468(12)00370-3/pdf|journal=[[Journal of Pediatric Surgery]]|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1051\u20131052|doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2012.05.004|year=2012}}</ref> They graduated from Harvard in 1937.<ref name=\"jps2\">{{cite journal|title=A tribute to Orvar Swenson on his 100th birthday|journal=[[Journal of Pediatric Surgery]]|first1= Jay L. |last1=Grosfeld|first2=H.

After a year, he returned to Boston to work at [[Boston Children's Hospital]] and [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]]. Initially a resident in [[pathology]], he took a residency in surgery from 1939 to 1945,<ref name=jps2/> after which he became an assistant professor of [[pediatric surgery]] at Harvard while working on the pediatric surgical staff at Boston Children's Hospital.<ref name=apsa/> In 1949 he moved to Boston's [[Floating Hospital for Children]] as surgeon-in-chief, making him the first pediatric surgeon on the staff at the hospital.<ref name=apsa/><ref name=jps2/> Subsequently he moved to Chicago in 1960 to become the surgeon-in-chief of [[Lurie Children's Hospital|Children's Memorial Hospital]], where he remained until his retirement in 1973.<ref name=apsa/> After his retirement from clinical practice, he moved to Miami and taught at the [[University of Miami]] until 1980.<ref name=jps2/>\n\n===Hirschsprung's disease===\nSwenson's main contributions to pediatric surgery focused on [[Hirschsprung's disease]], a [[congenital disease]] in which nerves are absent from part of the colon, causing constipation and [[megacolon]] (abnormal dilation of the colon). He began his research on the condition while he was a surgical resident in Boston.<ref name=apsa/> He discovered that the disease was caused by an absence of [[ganglion cell]]s in the [[rectum]], but before clarity on the cause of the disease, with Alexander Bill, they designed a surgical procedure to remove the abnormal section of the bowel, pull-through the normal bowel and [[surgical anastomosis|join]] it to the remaining parts of the normal bowel.<ref name=jps1/><ref name=Swenson1987>{{Cite journal|last=Swenson|first=Orvar|date=24 August 1989|title=My early experience with Hirschsprung's disease|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery|volume=24|issue=8|pages=844\u2013845|pmid=2671336|doi=10.1016/s0022-3468(89)80549-4}}</ref> \n\nWhen Swenson performed the procedure in 1948, it was the first successful surgical correction of megacolon.<ref name=jps2/> It was not however a real Hirschsprung's, as Swenson clarified later in an interview when Bill had said to him that \"this is just a weird case; it's not a real Hirschsprung's disease\".<ref name=\"Kendig2003\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/Pediatric-History-Center/Documents/Swenson.pdf|title=Orvar Swenson; Oral history project|last=Kendig|first=James W.|date=22 January 2003|work=American Academy of Pediatrics|access-date=20 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=Bill>{{cite journal |last1=Bill |first1=Alexander H., Jr. |title=Congenital Abnormalities of the Colon, Rectum and Anus |journal=Surgical Clinics of North America |date=1959 |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=1165\u20131177 |doi=10.1016/S0039-6109(16)35881-9 |pmid=13800688}}</ref> \n\nThis operation, however, became the only procedure that treated Hirschsprung's disease and became known as the \"[[Pull-through procedure|Swenson pull-through]]\". He described the hallmark clinical and radiological markers of Hirschsprung's disease in newborns and showed that the only way to make a definitive diagnosis was to perform a full-thickness rectal [[biopsy]]. Swenson subsequently followed his patients for a number of years.<ref name=\"jps1\"/> Over his career, he traveled to India, Australia, South America, Europe and Canada to demonstrate his procedure.<ref name=apsa/>\n\n===Other surgical work===\nAs well as Hirschsprung's disease, Swenson worked on the treatment of other birth defects. He performed [[esophagus|esophageal]] anastomoses for [[esophageal atresia]] and [[tracheoesophageal fistula]], and resection and anastomosis in [[intestinal atresia]].

This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.\n\nAt the lowest programming level,{{Clarify|reason=What 'level' means can be unclear to non-technical readers|date=August 2018}} [[executable code]] consists of [[Machine code|machine language]] instructions supported by an individual [[Microprocessor|processor]]\u2014typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of [[Binary number|binary values]] signifying [[Instruction set architecture|processor instructions]] that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer\u2014an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction [[System call|may also invoke]] one of many [[Input/output|input or output operations]], for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the [[User (computing)|user]]. The processor [[Instruction cycle|executes]] the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to [[branch instruction|\"jump\" to a different instruction]], or is [[interrupt]]ed by the operating system. {{As of|2015}}, most [[personal computer]]s, [[smartphone]] devices and [[Server (computing)|servers]] have [[Multi-core processor|processors with multiple execution units]] or [[Multiprocessing|multiple processors performing computation]] together, and computing has become a much more [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] activity than in the past.\n\nThe majority of software is written in [[high-level programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to [[natural language]]s than machine languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143144/http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compiler]] or an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or a combination of the two.

Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering and development of software.\n\nHowever, prior to 1946, software was not yet the programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers, as we now understand it. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to \"reprogram\" them.\n\nIn 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that [[John Wilder Tukey]]'s 1958 paper \"The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics\"<ref name=\"Tukey_1958\"/><ref name=\"Beebe_2017\"/> contained the earliest known usage of the term \"software\" found in a search of [[JSTOR]]'s electronic archives, predating the [[OED]]'s citation by two years.<ref name=\"Shapiro_2000\"/> This led many to credit Tukey with coining the term, particularly in obituaries published that same year,<ref name=\"Leonhardt_2000\"/> although Tukey never claimed credit for any such coinage. In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.<ref name=\"Niquette_2006\"/> The earliest known publication of the term \"software\" in an engineering context was in August 1953 by Richard R. Carhart, in a [[Rand Corporation]] Research Memorandum.<ref name=\"Carhart_1953\"/>\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|Software categories}}\n[[File:BgeCarSc.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Blender Game Engine]], a [[free software]].]]\n\nOn virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories.\n\n===Purpose, or domain of use===\n{{Ecommerce}}\nBased on the goal, computer software can be divided into:\n\n* '''[[Application software]]''' <br /> which is software that uses the computer system to perform special functions or provide [[video game|entertainment functions]] beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large\u2014see [[list of software]].\n* '''[[System software]]''' <br /> which is software for managing '''[[computer hardware]]''' behaviour, as to provide basic functionalities that are required by users, or for other software to run properly, if at all. System software is also designed for providing a platform for running application software,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|title=System Software|publisher=The University of Mississippi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530092843/http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|archive-date=30 May 2001|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and it includes the following:\n**'''[[Operating system]]s''' <br /> which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provide common services for other software that runs \"on top\" of them. [[Supervisory program]]s, [[boot loader]]s, [[shell (computing)|shells]] and [[window system]]s are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.\n** '''[[Device driver]]s''' <br /> which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.\n** '''[[Software utility|Utilities]]''' <br /> which are computer [[Control Panel (Windows)|programs]] designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.\n* '''[[Malicious software]]''' or '''malware''' <br /> which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as [[practical joke]]s.\n\n===Nature or domain of execution===\n* [[Desktop applications]] such as [[web browser]]s and [[Microsoft Office]], as well as [[smartphone]] and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] applications (called \"[[mobile app|apps]]\"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. [[Windows 8]], and later [[Ubuntu Touch]], tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)\n* [[JavaScript]] scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in [[web page]]s that are run directly inside the [[web browser]] when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is [[ActionScript]] scripts, which are supported by the [[Adobe Flash]] plugin.\n* [[Server software]], including:\n** [[Web application]]s, which usually run on the [[web server]] and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ASP.NET]], or even [[Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server]]. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.\n* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;\n* [[Embedded software]] resides as [[firmware]] within [[embedded system]]s, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as [[car]]s and [[television]]s (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can ''themselves'' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded Software\u2014Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May\u2013June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028045823/http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run [[embedded operating system]]s, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed application which is always run).\n* [[Microcode]] is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor ''itself'' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.\n\n===Programming tools===\n{{Main|Programming tool}}\nProgramming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that [[software developer]]s (also known as\n''programmers, coders, hackers'' or ''software engineers'') use to create, [[Debugging|debug]], [[Software maintenance|maintain]] (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise [[Technical support|support]] software.\n\nSoftware is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as [[compiler]]s, [[debugger]]s, [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], [[linker (computing)|linkers]], and [[text editor]]s, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.\n\n==Topics==\n===Architecture===\n{{See also|Software architecture}}\nUsers often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.\n\n* '''Platform software''' <br /> The [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.\n* '''Application software''' <br /> [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. [[Application software]] is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other \"system software\" as applications.\n* '''User-written software''' <br /> [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software includes spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.\n\n===Execution===\n{{Main|Execution (computing)}}\nComputer software has to be \"loaded\" into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction set architecture|instructions]] from the [[application software]], through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation\u2014moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.\n\nData movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using \"pointers\" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.<!-- This section is simply too long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.\n\nInstructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an \"if\" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a \"loop.\" Often, one instruction may \"call\" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[modular programming|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.\n\nA simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as \"Copy\" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as \"Paste\" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.\n\nDepending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].\n\nCurrently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master-level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art\u2014 especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nKinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[scripting language|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].-->\n\n===Quality and reliability===\n{{Main|Software quality|Software testing}}\nSoftware quality is very important, especially for [[commercial software|commercial]] and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called \"[[Software bug|bugs]]\" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as [[software aging]], the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.\n\nMany bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely\u2014if ever\u2014eliminates every bug; some programmers say that \"every program has at least one more bug\" (Lubarsky's Law).<ref name=\"github\">{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106154317/https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | archivedate=6 November 2015 | df=dmy-all | date=2018-05-09 }}</ref> In the [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed [[agile software development]], developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.\n\n===License===\n{{Main|Software license}}\nThe software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of [[free software license]]s, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.\n\n[[Proprietary software]] can be divided into two types:\n\n* [[freeware]], which includes the category of \"free trial\" software or \"[[freemium]]\" software (in the past, the term [[shareware]] was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used for free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.\n* software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed \"[[commercial software]]\", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.\n\n[[Open-source software]], on the other hand, comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.\n\n===Patents===\n{{Main|Software patent|Software patent debate}}\nSoftware patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a ''detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement'' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could ''do'', and user ''requirements'', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either\u2014the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid\u2014although since ''all'' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.<ref>Gerardo Con D\u00edaz, \"The Text in the Machine: American Copyright Law and the Many Natures of Software, 1974\u20131978,\u201d ''Technology and Culture'' 57 (October 2016), 753\u201379.</ref>\n\nSoftware patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers\u2014for example the patent for [[Aspect-Oriented Programming]] (AOP), which purported to claim rights over ''any'' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.\n\n==Design and implementation==\n{{Main|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}\nDesign and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] took much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because the latter has much more basic functionality.\n\nSoftware is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the [[Spring Framework]] is used for implementing [[enterprise application]]s, the [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web service]]s. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, a Microsoft Windows desktop application might call API functions in the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |title=MSDN Library |accessdate=2010-06-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204810/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> to close or open the application. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.\n\n[[Data structure]]s such as [[hash table]]s, [[array data type|arrays]], and [[binary tree]]s, and [[algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]], can be useful for creating software.\n\nComputer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=v.

More informal terms for programmer also exist such as \"coder\" and \"'''hacker'''\"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean [[Security hacker|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems]].\n\n==Industry and organizations==\n{{Main|Software industry}}\nA great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products - both market leaders in their respective product categories.\n\nNon-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and the [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop recommended software standards such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTML]], so that software can interoperate through these standards.\n\nOther well-known large software companies include [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Tata Consultancy Services|TCS]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[HCL Technologies]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sidetrade]] and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Software release life cycle]]\n* [[Independent software vendor]]\n* [[Outline of software]]\n* [[Software asset management]]\n* [[Open-source software]]\n{{Portal bar|Free and open-source software}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Carhart_1953\">{{cite book |author-last=Carhart |author-first=Richard |title=A survey of the current status of the electronic reliability problem |date=1953 |publisher=[[Rand Corporation]] |location=Santa Monica, CA |page=69 |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2013/RM1131.pdf#79 |access-date= |quote=[\u2026] It will be recalled from Sec. 1.6 that the term ''personnel'' was defined to include people who come into direct contact with the hardware, from production to field use, i.e., people who assemble, inspect, pack, ship, handle, install, operate, and maintain electronic equipment.

This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.\n\nAt the lowest programming level,{{Clarify|reason=What 'level' means can be unclear to non-technical readers|date=August 2018}} [[executable code]] consists of [[Machine code|machine language]] instructions supported by an individual [[Microprocessor|processor]]\u2014typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of [[Binary number|binary values]] signifying [[Instruction set architecture|processor instructions]] that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer\u2014an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction [[System call|may also invoke]] one of many [[Input/output|input or output operations]], for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the [[User (computing)|user]]. The processor [[Instruction cycle|executes]] the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to [[branch instruction|\"jump\" to a different instruction]], or is [[interrupt]]ed by the operating system. {{As of|2015}}, most [[personal computer]]s, [[smartphone]] devices and [[Server (computing)|servers]] have [[Multi-core processor|processors with multiple execution units]] or [[Multiprocessing|multiple processors performing computation]] together, and computing has become a much more [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] activity than in the past.\n\nThe majority of software is written in [[high-level programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to [[natural language]]s than machine languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143144/http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compiler]] or an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or a combination of the two.

Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering and development of software.\n\nHowever, prior to 1946, software was not yet the programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers, as we now understand it. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to \"reprogram\" them.\n\nIn 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that [[John Wilder Tukey]]'s 1958 paper \"The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics\"<ref name=\"Tukey_1958\"/><ref name=\"Beebe_2017\"/> contained the earliest known usage of the term \"software\" found in a search of [[JSTOR]]'s electronic archives, predating the [[OED]]'s citation by two years.<ref name=\"Shapiro_2000\"/> This led many to credit Tukey with coining the term, particularly in obituaries published that same year,<ref name=\"Leonhardt_2000\"/> although Tukey never claimed credit for any such coinage. In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.<ref name=\"Niquette_2006\"/> The earliest known publication of the term \"software\" in an engineering context was in August 1953 by Richard R.

There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large\u2014see [[list of software]].\n* '''[[System software]]''' <br /> which is software for managing '''[[computer hardware]]''' behaviour, as to provide basic functionalities that are required by users, or for other software to run properly, if at all.

[[Supervisory program]]s, [[boot loader]]s, [[shell (computing)|shells]] and [[window system]]s are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.\n** '''[[Device driver]]s''' <br /> which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.\n** '''[[Software utility|Utilities]]''' <br /> which are computer [[Control Panel (Windows)|programs]] designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.\n* '''[[Malicious software]]''' or '''malware''' <br /> which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as [[practical joke]]s.\n\n===Nature or domain of execution===\n* [[Desktop applications]] such as [[web browser]]s and [[Microsoft Office]], as well as [[smartphone]] and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] applications (called \"[[mobile app|apps]]\"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. [[Windows 8]], and later [[Ubuntu Touch]], tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)\n* [[JavaScript]] scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in [[web page]]s that are run directly inside the [[web browser]] when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is [[ActionScript]] scripts, which are supported by the [[Adobe Flash]] plugin.\n* [[Server software]], including:\n** [[Web application]]s, which usually run on the [[web server]] and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ASP.NET]], or even [[Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server]]. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.\n* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;\n* [[Embedded software]] resides as [[firmware]] within [[embedded system]]s, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as [[car]]s and [[television]]s (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can ''themselves'' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded Software\u2014Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May\u2013June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028045823/http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run [[embedded operating system]]s, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed application which is always run).\n* [[Microcode]] is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor ''itself'' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.\n\n===Programming tools===\n{{Main|Programming tool}}\nProgramming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that [[software developer]]s (also known as\n''programmers, coders, hackers'' or ''software engineers'') use to create, [[Debugging|debug]], [[Software maintenance|maintain]] (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise [[Technical support|support]] software.\n\nSoftware is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as [[compiler]]s, [[debugger]]s, [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], [[linker (computing)|linkers]], and [[text editor]]s, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.\n\n==Topics==\n===Architecture===\n{{See also|Software architecture}}\nUsers often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.\n\n* '''Platform software''' <br /> The [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.\n* '''Application software''' <br /> [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. [[Application software]] is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other \"system software\" as applications.\n* '''User-written software''' <br /> [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software includes spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.\n\n===Execution===\n{{Main|Execution (computing)}}\nComputer software has to be \"loaded\" into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction set architecture|instructions]] from the [[application software]], through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation\u2014moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.\n\nData movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using \"pointers\" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.<!-- This section is simply too long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.\n\nInstructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an \"if\" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a \"loop.\" Often, one instruction may \"call\" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[modular programming|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.\n\nA simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as \"Copy\" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as \"Paste\" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.\n\nDepending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].\n\nCurrently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master-level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art\u2014 especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nKinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[scripting language|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].-->\n\n===Quality and reliability===\n{{Main|Software quality|Software testing}}\nSoftware quality is very important, especially for [[commercial software|commercial]] and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called \"[[Software bug|bugs]]\" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as [[software aging]], the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.\n\nMany bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely\u2014if ever\u2014eliminates every bug; some programmers say that \"every program has at least one more bug\" (Lubarsky's Law).<ref name=\"github\">{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106154317/https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | archivedate=6 November 2015 | df=dmy-all | date=2018-05-09 }}</ref> In the [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed [[agile software development]], developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.\n\n===License===\n{{Main|Software license}}\nThe software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of [[free software license]]s, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.\n\n[[Proprietary software]] can be divided into two types:\n\n* [[freeware]], which includes the category of \"free trial\" software or \"[[freemium]]\" software (in the past, the term [[shareware]] was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used for free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.\n* software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed \"[[commercial software]]\", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.\n\n[[Open-source software]], on the other hand, comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.\n\n===Patents===\n{{Main|Software patent|Software patent debate}}\nSoftware patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a ''detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement'' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could ''do'', and user ''requirements'', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either\u2014the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid\u2014although since ''all'' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.<ref>Gerardo Con D\u00edaz, \"The Text in the Machine: American Copyright Law and the Many Natures of Software, 1974\u20131978,\u201d ''Technology and Culture'' 57 (October 2016), 753\u201379.</ref>\n\nSoftware patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers\u2014for example the patent for [[Aspect-Oriented Programming]] (AOP), which purported to claim rights over ''any'' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.\n\n==Design and implementation==\n{{Main|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}\nDesign and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] took much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because the latter has much more basic functionality.\n\nSoftware is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the [[Spring Framework]] is used for implementing [[enterprise application]]s, the [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web service]]s. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, a Microsoft Windows desktop application might call API functions in the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |title=MSDN Library |accessdate=2010-06-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204810/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> to close or open the application. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.\n\n[[Data structure]]s such as [[hash table]]s, [[array data type|arrays]], and [[binary tree]]s, and [[algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]], can be useful for creating software.\n\nComputer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=v.

More informal terms for programmer also exist such as \"coder\" and \"'''hacker'''\"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean [[Security hacker|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems]].\n\n==Industry and organizations==\n{{Main|Software industry}}\nA great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products - both market leaders in their respective product categories.\n\nNon-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and the [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop recommended software standards such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTML]], so that software can interoperate through these standards.\n\nOther well-known large software companies include [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Tata Consultancy Services|TCS]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[HCL Technologies]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sidetrade]] and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Software release life cycle]]\n* [[Independent software vendor]]\n* [[Outline of software]]\n* [[Software asset management]]\n* [[Open-source software]]\n{{Portal bar|Free and open-source software}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Carhart_1953\">{{cite book |author-last=Carhart |author-first=Richard |title=A survey of the current status of the electronic reliability problem |date=1953 |publisher=[[Rand Corporation]] |location=Santa Monica, CA |page=69 |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2013/RM1131.pdf#79 |access-date= |quote=[\u2026] It will be recalled from Sec. 1.6 that the term ''personnel'' was defined to include people who come into direct contact with the hardware, from production to field use, i.e., people who assemble, inspect, pack, ship, handle, install, operate, and maintain electronic equipment.
