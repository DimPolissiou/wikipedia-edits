From 1824 it was in a [[subsidiary alliance]] with [[British India]], making it what was considered a [[princely state]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Manipur |volume=17 |page=582}}</ref> It bordered [[Assam Province]] in the west and [[British Burma]] in the east, and in the 20th century covered an area of 22,327 square kilometres (8,621 sq mi) and contained 467 villages. The capital of the state was [[Imphal]].\n\nThe early history of Manipur is composed of mythical narratives. The [[Kangla Fort]], located on the banks of the [[Imphal River]], is where the palace of King Pakhangba was located. It was built in 1632 by king Khagemba, who had defeated Chinese invaders. In the fort, a number of temples that had traditional religious significance. Kangla means \"dry land\" in the old Meetei language.\n\n==Kangleipak State==\n\nThe Kingdom of Kangleipak was established by King Loiyumba in 1110 who ruled between 1074 and 1121. He consolidated the kingdom by incorporating most of the principalities in the surrounding hills and is credited with having enacted a kind of written constitution for his state.<ref name=\"PT\">Phanjoubam Tarapot, ''Bleeding Manipur'', Har Anand Publications (30 July 2007) {{ISBN|978-8124109021}}</ref>\nAfter subjugating all the villages within their valley Kangleipak kings grew in power and began a policy of expansion beyond their territory. In 1443 King Ningthoukhomba raided [[Akla]], an area ruled by [[Shan people]], initiating a policy of Manipuri claims to the neighbouring [[Kabaw Valley]].<ref name=\"PT\"/>\nThe zenith of the Kangleipak State was reached under the rule of King Khagemba (1597\u20131652). Khagemba's brother Prince Shalungba was not happy about Khagemba's rule so he fled to the [[Sylhet region]] where he allied with [[Bengali Muslim]] leaders. With a contingent of [[Sylhetis|Sylheti]] soldiers, Shalungba then attempted to invade Manipur but the soldiers were captured and made to work as labourers in Manipur.

In 1724 the [[Sanskrit]] name ''Manipur'' ('the Abode of Jewels') was adopted as the name of the state. King Gharib Nawaz made several incursions into [[Burma]], but no permanent conquest. After the death of Gharib Nawaz in 1754, Manipur was occupied by the [[Kingdom of Burma]] and the Manipuri king [[Ching-Thang Khomba|Jai Singh]] (Ching-Thang Khomba) sought help from the British. The latter, however, recalled the military force sent to assist Manipur and after that years passed without much contact between Manipur State and the British.<ref name=\"IGI\">{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_192.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 17, page 186 \u2013 Imperial Gazetteer of India \u2013 Digital South Asia Library|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> Manipur was invaded at the onset of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], together with [[Cachar]] and [[Assam Province|Assam]].\n\n==British protectorate==\nFollowing the [[Burmese invasions of Assam|Burmese invasions]], in 1824 the king of Manipur [[Gambhir Singh]] (Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba) asked the British for help and the request was granted. [[Sepoy]]s and artillery were sent and British officers trained a levy of Manipuri troops for the battles that ensued. After the Burmese were expelled, the Kabaw Valley down to the [[Ningthi River]] was added to the state.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\nIn 1824 Manipur became a [[British protectorate]] and in 1826 peace was concluded with Burma. Manipur remained relatively peaceful and prosperous until King Gambhir Singh's death in 1834. When he died his son was only one year old and his uncle [[Nara Singh]] was appointed as regent. That same year the British decided to restore the Kabaw Valley to the [[Kingdom of Burma]], which had never been happy about the loss. A compensation was paid to Raja of Manipur in the form of an annual allowance of [[Rupee|Rs]] 6,370 and a [[Residencies of British India|British residency]] was established in Imphal, the only town of the state, in 1835 to facilitate communication between the British and the rulers of Manipur.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\nAfter a thwarted attempt on his life, Nara Singh took power and held the throne until his death in 1850. \nHis brother [[Debindro Singh|Devendra Singh]] was given the title of Raja by the British, but he was unpopular. After only three months [[Maharaja Chandrakriti|Chandrakirti Singh]] invaded Manipur and rose to the throne, while Devendra Singh fled to Cachar. Numerous members of the royal family tried to overthrow Chandrakirti Singh, but none of the rebellions was successful. In 1879, when British Deputy Commissioner G.H. Damant was killed by an [[Angami Naga]] party, the king of Manipur assisted the British by sending troops to neighbouring [[Kohima]]. Following this service to the crown, Chandrakirti Singh was rewarded with the [[Order of the Star of India]]. The Kabaw Valley was restored to the Manipur Kingdom after the British decided to dispose of the ruling dynasty in Burma in 1885, forcing the last [[Thibaw Min|Burmese King]] to abdicate and ignominiously exiling the royal family to [[India]]. This event was followed the same year by the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]], when the British annexed all of Burma.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\nAfter Maharaja Chandrakriti's death in 1886 his son [[Maharaja Surchandra|Surachandra Singh]] succeeded him. As in previous occasions, several claimants to the throne tried to overthrow the new king. The first three attempts were defeated, but in 1890, following an attack on the palace by Tikendrajit and Kulachandra Singh, two of the king's brothers, Surachandra Singh announced his intention to abdicate and left Manipur for Cachar. [[Kulachandra Singh]], the king's younger brother, then rose to the throne while [[Tikendrajit|Tikendrajit Singh]], an older brother and commander of the Manipuri armed forces, held the real power behind the scenes. Meanwhile, Surachandra Singh, once safely away from Manipur appealed to the British for help to recover the throne.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\n===The 'Manipur Expedition'===\n\n{{main|Anglo-Manipur War}}\nThe British decided to recognise Juvraj Kulachandra Singh as Raja, and to send a military expedition of 400 men to Manipur to punish Senapati Tikendrajit Singh as the main person responsible for the unrest and the dynastic disturbances. This action and the violent events that followed are known in British annals as the 'Manipur Expedition, 1891',<ref>Ian F.W. Beckett, ''Victoria's Wars'', Shire, {{ISBN|978-0747803881}}, p. 62</ref> while in Manipur they are known as the 'Anglo-Manipur War of 1891'.\n\nThe British attempt to remove Tikendrajit from his position as military commander (Senapati) and arrest him on 24 March 1891 caused a great stir. The British Residency in Imphal was attacked and the Chief Commissioner for Assam [[James Wallace Quinton|J.W. Quinton]], Col. Sken and three other British officials were murdered. In the middle of the unrest Ethel St Clair Grimwood, the widow of Frank St Clair Grimmond, the killed British Resident, successfully led a party of surviving [[sepoy]]s out of Manipur to Cachar.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/grimwood/manipur/manipur.html Ethel St. Clair Grimwood, ''My Three Years in Manipur and Escape from the Recent Mutiny'' (fl.1891)]</ref> Without much delay, a 5,000 strong punitive expedition was sent against Manipur on 27 April 1891. Three British columns entered Manipur from [[British Burma]], Cachar and the Naga Hills, which after several skirmishes with the 3,000 men strong Manipuri army, managed to pacify the kingdom. Following the British attack Senapati Tikendrajit and young king Kulachandra fled, but were captured. The Senapati and those Manipuris who had been involved in the killing of the British officers were tried and hanged, while the deposed King Kulachandra and other leaders of the rebellion were sent to the [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman Islands]]. At this time until 22 September 1891, Manipur was briefly [[annexation|annexed]] to [[British India]] by virtue of the [[doctrine of lapse]]. On 22 September 1891 when [[Meidingngu Churachand]] (Churachandra), a 5-year-old boy, was put on the throne, power was restored nominally to the Manipuri crown over the state. During the dynastic disturbances and the British intervention the Naga and [[Kuki people|Kuki]] hill tribes of the state lapsed into lawlessness, with numerous instances of murder and arson in the mountain villages, a situation that lasted well into 1894.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\n===The 20th century: Twilight and end of the princely state===\n\nThe child ruler Churachand belonged to a side branch of the Manipur royal family, so that all the main contenders to the throne were bypassed. While he was a minor the affairs of state were administered by the British [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]], which facilitated the introduction and implementation of reforms. The first paved road to Manipur was inaugurated in 1900 \u2014until then there had been no proper roads to reach the kingdom\u2014 and this improvement in communication facilitated a visit by Viceroy [[Lord Curzon]] in 1901.\nRaja Churachand was formally declared king in 1907 after completing education in [[Ajmer-Merwara|Ajmer]].<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\nIn 1918 he was given the privilege to use the title '[[Maharaja]]' and during his reign Manipur enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity. In 1934 king Churachand was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#knighthood|knighted]] by the British, becoming Sir Churachandra Singh.<ref name=\"WSt\"/>\n\nBetween March 1944 and July 1944 part of Manipur and the [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills District]] of Assam Province were occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. The capital Imphal was shelled on 10 May 1942.\n\nThe last ruler of the Kingdom of Manipur was Maharaja [[Bodhchandra Singh]].

From 1824 it was in a [[subsidiary alliance]] with [[British India]], making it what was considered a [[princely state]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Manipur |volume=17 |page=582}}</ref> It bordered [[Assam Province]] in the west and [[British Burma]] in the east, and in the 20th century covered an area of 22,327 square kilometres (8,621 sq mi) and contained 467 villages. The capital of the state was [[Imphal]].\n\nThe early history of Manipur is composed of mythical narratives. The [[Kangla Fort]], located on the banks of the [[Imphal River]], is where the palace of King Pakhangba was located. It was built in 1632 by king Khagemba, who had defeated Chinese invaders. In the fort, a number of temples that had traditional religious significance. Kangla means \"dry land\" in the old Meetei language.\n\n==Kangleipak State==\n\nThe Kingdom of Kangleipak was established by King Loiyumba in 1110 who ruled between 1074 and 1121. He consolidated the kingdom by incorporating most of the principalities in the surrounding hills and is credited with having enacted a kind of written constitution for his state.<ref name=\"PT\">Phanjoubam Tarapot, ''Bleeding Manipur'', Har Anand Publications (30 July 2007) {{ISBN|978-8124109021}}</ref>\nAfter subjugating all the villages within their valley Kangleipak kings grew in power and began a policy of expansion beyond their territory. In 1443 King Ningthoukhomba raided [[Akla]], an area ruled by [[Shan people]], initiating a policy of Manipuri claims to the neighbouring [[Kabaw Valley]].<ref name=\"PT\"/>\nThe zenith of the Kangleipak State was reached under the rule of King Khagemba (1597\u20131652). Khagemba's brother Prince Shalungba was not happy about Khagemba's rule so he fled to the [[Sylhet region]] where he allied with [[Bengali Muslim]] leaders. With a contingent of [[Sylhetis|Sylheti]] soldiers, Shalungba then attempted to invade Manipur but the soldiers were captured and made to work as labourers in Manipur. These soldiers married local [[Meitei people|Manipuri women]] and adapted to the [[Meitei language]]. They introduced [[hookah]] to Manipur and founded the [[Pangal]] or Manipuri Muslim community.<ref name=back>{{cite book|first=Rajmohan|last=Nath|title=The back-ground of Assamese culture|page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126984/page/n137 90]|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126984|year=1948|publisher=A. K. Nath|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nIn 1714 a king, named [[Pamheiba|Meidingu Pamheiba]], adopted [[Hinduism]] as the state religion and changed his name to Gharib Nawaz. In 1724 the [[Sanskrit]] name ''Manipur'' ('the Abode of Jewels') was adopted as the name of the state. King Gharib Nawaz made several incursions into [[Burma]], but no permanent conquest. After the death of Gharib Nawaz in 1754, Manipur was occupied by the [[Kingdom of Burma]] and the Manipuri king [[Ching-Thang Khomba|Jai Singh]] (Ching-Thang Khomba) sought help from the British. The latter, however, recalled the military force sent to assist Manipur and after that years passed without much contact between Manipur State and the British.<ref name=\"IGI\">{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_192.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 17, page 186 \u2013 Imperial Gazetteer of India \u2013 Digital South Asia Library|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> Manipur was invaded at the onset of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], together with [[Cachar]] and [[Assam Province|Assam]].\n\n==British protectorate==\nFollowing the [[Burmese invasions of Assam|Burmese invasions]], in 1824 the king of Manipur [[Gambhir Singh]] (Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba) asked the British for help and the request was granted. [[Sepoy]]s and artillery were sent and British officers trained a levy of Manipuri troops for the battles that ensued. After the Burmese were expelled, the Kabaw Valley down to the [[Ningthi River]] was added to the state.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\nIn 1824 Manipur became a [[British protectorate]] and in 1826 peace was concluded with Burma. Manipur remained relatively peaceful and prosperous until King Gambhir Singh's death in 1834. When he died his son was only one year old and his uncle [[Nara Singh]] was appointed as regent. That same year the British decided to restore the Kabaw Valley to the [[Kingdom of Burma]], which had never been happy about the loss. A compensation was paid to Raja of Manipur in the form of an annual allowance of [[Rupee|Rs]] 6,370 and a [[Residencies of British India|British residency]] was established in Imphal, the only town of the state, in 1835 to facilitate communication between the British and the rulers of Manipur.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\nAfter a thwarted attempt on his life, Nara Singh took power and held the throne until his death in 1850. \nHis brother [[Debindro Singh|Devendra Singh]] was given the title of Raja by the British, but he was unpopular. After only three months [[Maharaja Chandrakriti|Chandrakirti Singh]] invaded Manipur and rose to the throne, while Devendra Singh fled to Cachar. Numerous members of the royal family tried to overthrow Chandrakirti Singh, but none of the rebellions was successful. In 1879, when British Deputy Commissioner G.H. Damant was killed by an [[Angami Naga]] party, the king of Manipur assisted the British by sending troops to neighbouring [[Kohima]]. Following this service to the crown, Chandrakirti Singh was rewarded with the [[Order of the Star of India]]. The Kabaw Valley was restored to the Manipur Kingdom after the British decided to dispose of the ruling dynasty in Burma in 1885, forcing the last [[Thibaw Min|Burmese King]] to abdicate and ignominiously exiling the royal family to [[India]]. This event was followed the same year by the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]], when the British annexed all of Burma.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\nAfter Maharaja Chandrakriti's death in 1886 his son [[Maharaja Surchandra|Surachandra Singh]] succeeded him. As in previous occasions, several claimants to the throne tried to overthrow the new king. The first three attempts were defeated, but in 1890, following an attack on the palace by Tikendrajit and Kulachandra Singh, two of the king's brothers, Surachandra Singh announced his intention to abdicate and left Manipur for Cachar. [[Kulachandra Singh]], the king's younger brother, then rose to the throne while [[Tikendrajit|Tikendrajit Singh]], an older brother and commander of the Manipuri armed forces, held the real power behind the scenes. Meanwhile, Surachandra Singh, once safely away from Manipur appealed to the British for help to recover the throne.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\n===The 'Manipur Expedition'===\n\n{{main|Anglo-Manipur War}}\nThe British decided to recognise Juvraj Kulachandra Singh as Raja, and to send a military expedition of 400 men to Manipur to punish Senapati Tikendrajit Singh as the main person responsible for the unrest and the dynastic disturbances. This action and the violent events that followed are known in British annals as the 'Manipur Expedition, 1891',<ref>Ian F.W. Beckett, ''Victoria's Wars'', Shire, {{ISBN|978-0747803881}}, p. 62</ref> while in Manipur they are known as the 'Anglo-Manipur War of 1891'.\n\nThe British attempt to remove Tikendrajit from his position as military commander (Senapati) and arrest him on 24 March 1891 caused a great stir. The British Residency in Imphal was attacked and the Chief Commissioner for Assam [[James Wallace Quinton|J.W. Quinton]], Col. Sken and three other British officials were murdered. In the middle of the unrest Ethel St Clair Grimwood, the widow of Frank St Clair Grimmond, the killed British Resident, successfully led a party of surviving [[sepoy]]s out of Manipur to Cachar.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/grimwood/manipur/manipur.html Ethel St. Clair Grimwood, ''My Three Years in Manipur and Escape from the Recent Mutiny'' (fl.1891)]</ref> Without much delay, a 5,000 strong punitive expedition was sent against Manipur on 27 April 1891. Three British columns entered Manipur from [[British Burma]], Cachar and the Naga Hills, which after several skirmishes with the 3,000 men strong Manipuri army, managed to pacify the kingdom. Following the British attack Senapati Tikendrajit and young king Kulachandra fled, but were captured. The Senapati and those Manipuris who had been involved in the killing of the British officers were tried and hanged, while the deposed King Kulachandra and other leaders of the rebellion were sent to the [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman Islands]]. At this time until 22 September 1891, Manipur was briefly [[annexation|annexed]] to [[British India]] by virtue of the [[doctrine of lapse]]. On 22 September 1891 when [[Meidingngu Churachand]] (Churachandra), a 5-year-old boy, was put on the throne, power was restored nominally to the Manipuri crown over the state. During the dynastic disturbances and the British intervention the Naga and [[Kuki people|Kuki]] hill tribes of the state lapsed into lawlessness, with numerous instances of murder and arson in the mountain villages, a situation that lasted well into 1894.<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\n\n===The 20th century: Twilight and end of the princely state===\n\nThe child ruler Churachand belonged to a side branch of the Manipur royal family, so that all the main contenders to the throne were bypassed. While he was a minor the affairs of state were administered by the British [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]], which facilitated the introduction and implementation of reforms. The first paved road to Manipur was inaugurated in 1900 \u2014until then there had been no proper roads to reach the kingdom\u2014 and this improvement in communication facilitated a visit by Viceroy [[Lord Curzon]] in 1901.\nRaja Churachand was formally declared king in 1907 after completing education in [[Ajmer-Merwara|Ajmer]].<ref name=\"IGI\"/>\nIn 1918 he was given the privilege to use the title '[[Maharaja]]' and during his reign Manipur enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity. In 1934 king Churachand was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#knighthood|knighted]] by the British, becoming Sir Churachandra Singh.<ref name=\"WSt\"/>\n\nBetween March 1944 and July 1944 part of Manipur and the [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills District]] of Assam Province were occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. The capital Imphal was shelled on 10 May 1942.\n\nThe last ruler of the Kingdom of Manipur was Maharaja [[Bodhchandra Singh]]. He ruled between 1941 and 1949.\n\n===Integration into India===\nOn 15 August 1947, with the lapse of paramountcy of the British Crown, Manipur became briefly \"independent\".<ref name=Akoijam>{{citation |first=A.

Durand]], 1837.]]\n\n'''''The Course of Empire''''' is a series of five paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in the years 1833\u20131836. It is notable in part for reflecting popular American sentiments of the times, when many saw [[pastoralism]] as the ideal phase of human civilization, fearing that empire would lead to gluttony and inevitable decay.  The theme of cycles is one that Cole returned to frequently, such as in his ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series. ''The Course of Empire'' comprises the following works: '''''The Course of Empire \u2013 The Savage State'''''; '''''The Arcadian or Pastoral State'''''; '''''The Consummation of Empire'''''; '''''Destruction'''''; and '''''Desolation'''''. All the paintings are 39.5&nbsp;inches by 63.5&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;cm by 161&nbsp;cm) except ''The Consummation of Empire'' which is 51\" by 76\" (130&nbsp;cm by 193&nbsp;cm).\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:The Course of Empire Installation Diagram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cole's 1833 sketch for the arrangement of the paintings around Reed's fireplace: the sketch also shows above the paintings three aspects of the Sun: left (rising); center (zenith); right (setting)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;width:100%\"\n|-\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Savage State 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''The Savage State'']]''The Savage State''\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Consummation The Course of the Empire 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''The Consummation'']]''The Consummation''\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Destruction 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''Destruction'']]''Destruction''\n|-\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''The Arcadian or Pastoral State'']]''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''\n|\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Desolation 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''Desolation'']]''Desolation''\n|-\n|}\n]]\nThe series of paintings depicts the growth and fall of an imaginary city, situated on the lower end of a river valley, near its meeting with a bay of the sea.  The valley is distinctly identifiable in each of the paintings, in part because of an unusual landmark:  a large boulder is situated atop a crag overlooking the valley.  Some critics believe this is meant to contrast the immutability of the earth with the transience of man.\n\nA direct source of literary inspiration for ''The Course of Empire'' paintings is [[Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' (1812\u201318).  Cole quoted lines from Canto IV in his newspaper advertisements for the series:<ref>Hay, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EEY3DwAAQBAJ&dq=thomas+cole+byron+advertisement+empire&source=gbs_navlinks_s Postapocalyptic Fantasies in Antebellum American Literature]''.

Clouds and mist shroud much of the distant landscape, hinting at the uncertain future.  A hunter clad in skins hastens through the wilderness, pursuing a fleeing deer; canoes paddle up the river; on the far shore can be seen a clearing with a cluster of tipis around a fire, the nucleus of the city that is to be.  The visual references are those of aboriginal North American life. This painting depicts the ideal state of the natural world. It is a healthy world, unchanged by humanity.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''The Arcadian or Pastoral State'' ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''.

The viewpoint has shifted further down the river, as the crag with the boulder is now on the left-hand side of the painting; a forked peak can be seen in the distance beyond it. Much of the wilderness has given way to settled lands, with plowed fields and lawns visible. Various activities go on in the background: plowing, boat-building, herding sheep, dancing; in the foreground, an old man sketches what may be a geometrical problem with a stick. On a bluff on the near side of the river, a [[megalithic]] temple has been built, and smoke (presumably from sacrifices) arises from it.  The images reflect an idealized, pre-urban ancient Greece. This work shows humanity at peace with the land. The environment has been altered, but not so much so that it or its inhabitants are in danger. Yet the construction of the warship and the concerned mother watching as her child sketches a soldier, herald the emerging imperial ambitions.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''The Consummation of Empire'' ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}[[File:Cole Thomas The Consummation The Course of the Empire 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Consummation of Empire''.

It is noontide of a glorious summer day. Both sides of the river valley are now covered in colonnaded marble structures, whose steps run down into the water. The megalithic temple seems to have been transformed into a huge domed structure dominating the river-bank. The mouth of the river is guarded by two [[wikt:pharos|pharoi]], and ships with [[lateen]] sails go out to the sea beyond.  A joyous crowd gathers on the balconies and terraces as a scarlet-robed king or victorious general crosses a bridge connecting the two sides of the river in a triumphant procession.  In the foreground, an elaborate fountain gushes.  The look of the painting suggests the height of ancient Rome. The decadence seen in every detail of this cityscape foreshadows the inevitable fall of this mighty civilization.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Destruction'' ===\n[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Destruction 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Destruction''.

The action is the sack and destruction of the city, in the course of a tempest seen in the distance.  It seems that a fleet of enemy warriors has overthrown the city's defenses, sailed up the river, and is busy ransacking the city and killing its inhabitants and raping women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrystal|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMWIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women at War in the Classical World|date=2017-02-28|publisher=Grub Street Publishers|isbn=978-1-4738-5661-5|language=en}}</ref> The bridge across which the triumphant procession had crossed is broken; a makeshift crossing strains under the weight of soldiers and refugees. Columns are broken, and fire breaks from the upper floors of a palace on the river bank.\n\nIn the foreground a statue of some venerable hero (posed like the ''[[Borghese Warrior|Borghese Gladiator]]'') stands headless, still striding forward into the uncertain future.{{efn|The artist's name and date 1836 can just be seen on the base of the statue}} In the waning light of late afternoon, the dead lie where they fell, in fountains and atop the monuments built to celebrate the affluence of the now fallen civilization. The scene is perhaps suggested by the [[Vandals|Vandal]] [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] in 455. On the other hand, a detail in the lower right of \"The Consummation of Empire\" shows two children, maybe brothers, fighting, one clad in red and the other in green\u2014the colors of banners of the two contending forces in \"Destruction,\" which thus might depict a foreshadowed civil war. The children, now men, are shown, with one having finally prevailed over the other but seemingly in contemplation of the heavy price paid.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Desolation'' ===\n[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Desolation 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Desolation''.

We view the remains of the city in the livid light of a dying day. The landscape has begun to return to wilderness and no humans are to be seen; but the remnants of their architecture emerge from beneath a mantle of trees, ivy, and other overgrowth.

Durand - Portrait of Thomas Cole - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Thomas Cole'' by [[Asher Brown Durand|Asher B. Durand]], 1837.]]\n\n'''''The Course of Empire''''' is a series of five paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in the years 1833\u20131836. It is notable in part for reflecting popular American sentiments of the times, when many saw [[pastoralism]] as the ideal phase of human civilization, fearing that empire would lead to gluttony and inevitable decay.  The theme of cycles is one that Cole returned to frequently, such as in his ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series. ''The Course of Empire'' comprises the following works: '''''The Course of Empire \u2013 The Savage State'''''; '''''The Arcadian or Pastoral State'''''; '''''The Consummation of Empire'''''; '''''Destruction'''''; and '''''Desolation'''''. All the paintings are 39.5&nbsp;inches by 63.5&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;cm by 161&nbsp;cm) except ''The Consummation of Empire'' which is 51\" by 76\" (130&nbsp;cm by 193&nbsp;cm).\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:The Course of Empire Installation Diagram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cole's 1833 sketch for the arrangement of the paintings around Reed's fireplace: the sketch also shows above the paintings three aspects of the Sun: left (rising); center (zenith); right (setting)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;width:100%\"\n|-\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Savage State 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''The Savage State'']]''The Savage State''\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Consummation The Course of the Empire 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''The Consummation'']]''The Consummation''\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Destruction 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''Destruction'']]''Destruction''\n|-\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''The Arcadian or Pastoral State'']]''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''\n|\n|[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Desolation 1836.jpg|alt=|center|frameless|upright=0.4|''Desolation'']]''Desolation''\n|-\n|}\n]]\nThe series of paintings depicts the growth and fall of an imaginary city, situated on the lower end of a river valley, near its meeting with a bay of the sea.  The valley is distinctly identifiable in each of the paintings, in part because of an unusual landmark:  a large boulder is situated atop a crag overlooking the valley.  Some critics believe this is meant to contrast the immutability of the earth with the transience of man.\n\nA direct source of literary inspiration for ''The Course of Empire'' paintings is [[Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' (1812\u201318).  Cole quoted lines from Canto IV in his newspaper advertisements for the series:<ref>Hay, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EEY3DwAAQBAJ&dq=thomas+cole+byron+advertisement+empire&source=gbs_navlinks_s Postapocalyptic Fantasies in Antebellum American Literature]''. Cambridge University Press, 2017.</ref>\n\n{{quote|First freedom and then Glory \u2013 when that fails,<br />\nWealth, vice, corruption...}}\n\nCole designed these paintings to be displayed prominently in the picture gallery on the third floor of the mansion of his patron, [[Luman Reed]], at 13 [[Greenwich Street]], New York City.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the Series: The Course of Empire |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/69/series/ |accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref> The layout was approximately as shown here, according to Cole's installation diagram.<ref>{{cite web |title=Installation Diagram for the Course of Empire |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/gallery/items/303 |accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref> The series was acquired by The [[New-York Historical Society]] in 1858 as a gift of the New-York Gallery of Fine Arts.<ref>[http://emuseum.nyhistory.org/emuseum/view/objects/asitem/search$0040/23/title-asc?t:state:flow=dade77d2-6d87-41b6-8c1d-9644fd46ee6a New-York Historical Society eMuseum]</ref>\n\n== ''The Course of Empire'' ==\n\n=== ''The Savage State'' ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Savage State 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Savage State''.

Clouds and mist shroud much of the distant landscape, hinting at the uncertain future.  A hunter clad in skins hastens through the wilderness, pursuing a fleeing deer; canoes paddle up the river; on the far shore can be seen a clearing with a cluster of tipis around a fire, the nucleus of the city that is to be.  The visual references are those of aboriginal North American life. This painting depicts the ideal state of the natural world. It is a healthy world, unchanged by humanity.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''The Arcadian or Pastoral State'' ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''.

The viewpoint has shifted further down the river, as the crag with the boulder is now on the left-hand side of the painting; a forked peak can be seen in the distance beyond it. Much of the wilderness has given way to settled lands, with plowed fields and lawns visible. Various activities go on in the background: plowing, boat-building, herding sheep, dancing; in the foreground, an old man sketches what may be a geometrical problem with a stick. On a bluff on the near side of the river, a [[megalithic]] temple has been built, and smoke (presumably from sacrifices) arises from it.  The images reflect an idealized, pre-urban ancient Greece. This work shows humanity at peace with the land. The environment has been altered, but not so much so that it or its inhabitants are in danger. Yet the construction of the warship and the concerned mother watching as her child sketches a soldier, herald the emerging imperial ambitions.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''The Consummation of Empire'' ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}[[File:Cole Thomas The Consummation The Course of the Empire 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Consummation of Empire''.

It is noontide of a glorious summer day. Both sides of the river valley are now covered in colonnaded marble structures, whose steps run down into the water. The megalithic temple seems to have been transformed into a huge domed structure dominating the river-bank. The mouth of the river is guarded by two [[wikt:pharos|pharoi]], and ships with [[lateen]] sails go out to the sea beyond.  A joyous crowd gathers on the balconies and terraces as a scarlet-robed king or victorious general crosses a bridge connecting the two sides of the river in a triumphant procession.  In the foreground, an elaborate fountain gushes.  The look of the painting suggests the height of ancient Rome. The decadence seen in every detail of this cityscape foreshadows the inevitable fall of this mighty civilization.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Destruction'' ===\n[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Destruction 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Destruction''. Oil on canvas, 1836, {{frac|39|1|2}} \u00d7 {{frac|63|1|2}} in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/69 |title=The Course of Empire: Destruction |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nThe fourth painting, ''Destruction'', has almost the same perspective as the third, though the artist has stepped back a bit to allow a wider scene of the action, and moved almost to the center of the river. The action is the sack and destruction of the city, in the course of a tempest seen in the distance.  It seems that a fleet of enemy warriors has overthrown the city's defenses, sailed up the river, and is busy ransacking the city and killing its inhabitants and raping women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrystal|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMWIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women at War in the Classical World|date=2017-02-28|publisher=Grub Street Publishers|isbn=978-1-4738-5661-5|language=en}}</ref> The bridge across which the triumphant procession had crossed is broken; a makeshift crossing strains under the weight of soldiers and refugees. Columns are broken, and fire breaks from the upper floors of a palace on the river bank.\n\nIn the foreground a statue of some venerable hero (posed like the ''[[Borghese Warrior]]'') stands headless, still striding forward into the uncertain future.{{efn|The artist's name and date 1836 can just be seen on the base of the statue}} In the waning light of late afternoon, the dead lie where they fell, in fountains and atop the monuments built to celebrate the affluence of the now fallen civilization. The scene is perhaps suggested by the [[Vandals|Vandal]] [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] in 455. On the other hand, a detail in the lower right of \"The Consummation of Empire\" shows two children, maybe brothers, fighting, one clad in red and the other in green\u2014the colors of banners of the two contending forces in \"Destruction,\" which thus might depict a foreshadowed civil war. The children, now men, are shown, with one having finally prevailed over the other but seemingly in contemplation of the heavy price paid.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Desolation'' ===\n[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Desolation 1836.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Desolation''.

We view the remains of the city in the livid light of a dying day. The landscape has begun to return to wilderness and no humans are to be seen; but the remnants of their architecture emerge from beneath a mantle of trees, ivy, and other overgrowth. The broken stumps of the pharoi loom in the background. The arches of the shattered bridge and the columns of the temple are still visible; a single column looms in the foreground, now a nesting place for birds. The sunrise of the first painting is mirrored here by a moonrise, a pale light reflecting in the ruin-choked river while the standing pillar reflects the last rays of sunset. This gloomy picture suggests how all empires could be after their fall. It is a harsh possible future in which humanity has been destroyed by its own hand.\n\nThis cycle reflects Cole's pessimism, and is often seen as a commentary on [[Andrew Jackson]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Lewis made his debut on the series in June 2007 and it is considered his breakout role. In 2008, Lewis won the Most Popular New Male Talent award at the 2008 [[Logie Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/b/logieawards/category/au-tv-special4 |title=2008 TV Week Logie Awards |publisher=au.tv.yahoo.com |accessdate=18 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723110426/http://au.tv.yahoo.com/b/logieawards/category/au-tv-special4 |archivedate=23 July 2008 }}</ref> In June 2009, Seven announced Lewis would be one of the eleven celebrity contestants in  [[Dancing with the Stars (Australian season 9)|ninth series]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (Australian TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.

Lewis also received the inaugural \"Male Star of Tomorrow\" Award at the 2011 Australian International Movie Convention on the Gold Coast.\nIn July 2010, Lewis once again joined the [[Nine Network]] to star in Crime Drama television series ''[[Underbelly: Razor]]'' as Bruce Higgs. The role required Lewis to perform his first onscreen nudity scene.\n\nIn October 2010 it was announced that Lewis had been cast in the Australian ensemble Horror film ''Bait 3D''. The film which also stars [[Xavier Samuel]] and [[Sharni Vinson]] required Lewis to return to his home state Queensland. The film follows a group of people trapped in a supermarket with a group of great white  sharks after a freak tsunami. \nIn November 2010 Lewis was cast in a recurring role on the highly successful [[Foxtel]] Teen Drama television series ''[[Slide (TV series)|SLiDE]]''.

It was originally created by Toni Fingerroos, Fingersoft's founder, and is the company's best-known product. The player controls a driver across hilly terrains, collecting coins along the way and spending them on vehicular upgrades while being watchful of the driver's head as well as the vehicle's fuel supply.\n\nThe game received generally somewhat favorable reviews. Critics tended to describe the graphics as being rudimentary at best or ugly at worst and sometimes panned the gameplay as unimpressive, but the former was overlooked when they lauded the physics. Further praise went to the simplistic two-button controls and the [[freemium]] monetization model for its passive approach. Its success led to the creation of one sequel, ''Hill Climb Racing 2'' in 2016, and in 2018, the ''Hill Climb Racing'' franchise became the second Finnish mobile game franchise after [[Rovio Entertainment|Rovio]]'s ''[[Angry Birds]]''to amass one billion downloads.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Hill Climb Racing gameplay.png|thumb|right|Screenshot illustrating elevation as the main aspect of the game. Throughout this course, coins are spread in groups, with some of them accompanied by fuel and gems (as shown on the center-right). The top-left portion of the screen comprises the fuel gauge and an inventory of coins and gems.]]\nThe object of ''Hill Climb Racing'' is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing stages as possible while collecting coins,<ref name=review-mobil.se/> taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics<ref name=review-modojo/> and using only two simple controls: the Gas and Brake pedals. Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over to earn more coins, which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles (including monster trucks, dirt bikes, tanks, and Santa's sleigh).<ref name=review-sfgate/> Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the driving avatar's head.<ref name=fvg-hac/>{{rp|271}} \n\nSince its inception, ''Hill Climb Racing'' has seen updates that add new content. For example, the garage was introduced in a December 2016 update, where players can purchase cars and tune their parts. Gems were also introduced as a currency of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/Fingersoft/status/811945488459112448|title=The Garage update for #HillClimbRacing is out now on Google Play and Apple App Store!|work=[[Twitter]]|publisher=Fingersoft|date=December 22, 2016|accessdate=August 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190817034013/https://mobile.twitter.com/Fingersoft/status/811945488459112448|archivedate=August 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n\n''Hill Climb Racing'' was developed by Toni Fingerroos, a self-taught Finnish programmer who was 29 years old at the time of the game's release. Prior to the game, he started writing software at the age of ten. He was intrigued by car racing, and wrote ''Ralli 94'' and shared it with his friends. At that time, when he thought that games were developed by firms and not by people, he named his own hobbyist firm Fingersoft.<ref name=wsj-Feb2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fingersoft-finds-simple-is-profitable-1391523498|title=Fingersoft Finds Simple Is Profitable|last=Rossi|first=Juhana|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name=ht-Oct2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/business/12409-turning-his-business-around.html|title=Turning his business around|last=Teivainen|first=Aleksi|work=[[Helsinki Times]]|date=October 18, 2014|accessdate=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA decade after his first game, Fingerroos revived the Fingersoft trade name as a professional studio that programmed games for [[Nokia]] mobile phones. Fingerroos described he \"failed at that quite miserably.\" He since pursued other occupations, all with unfavorable outcomes. One of them was working with Pixolane, a game studio, and spending his money on developing a [[PlayStation 3]] game called ''Rust Buckaneers''<ref name=fvg-hac/>{{rp|243}} that was ultimately cancelled as the studio wasted its seed money, which caused him to accumulate debt. Another was repairing and selling sports cars imported from Japan and the United Kingdom, which also drained his personal savings. Fingerroos returned to and revived again Fingersoft in late 2011, where as the company's sole worker, he designed a photography application every few days to see whether some of them would turn out to be successful. One of these apps was ''Cartoon Camera'', released in February 2012 and having quickly amassed over ten million downloads.

It was originally created by Toni Fingerroos, Fingersoft's founder, and is the company's best-known product. The player controls a driver across hilly terrains, collecting coins along the way and spending them on vehicular upgrades while being watchful of the driver's head as well as the vehicle's fuel supply.\n\nThe game received generally somewhat favorable reviews. Critics tended to describe the graphics as being rudimentary at best or ugly at worst and sometimes panned the gameplay as unimpressive, but the former was overlooked when they lauded the physics. Further praise went to the simplistic two-button controls and the [[freemium]] monetization model for its passive approach. Its success led to the creation of one sequel, ''Hill Climb Racing 2'' in 2016, and in 2018, the ''Hill Climb Racing'' franchise became the second Finnish mobile game franchise after [[Rovio Entertainment|Rovio]]'s ''[[Angry Birds]]''to amass one billion downloads.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Hill Climb Racing gameplay.png|thumb|right|Screenshot illustrating elevation as the main aspect of the game. Throughout this course, coins are spread in groups, with some of them accompanied by fuel and gems (as shown on the center-right). The top-left portion of the screen comprises the fuel gauge and an inventory of coins and gems.]]\nThe object of ''Hill Climb Racing'' is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing stages as possible while collecting coins,<ref name=review-mobil.se/> taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics<ref name=review-modojo/> and using only two simple controls: the Gas and Brake pedals. Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over to earn more coins, which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles (including monster trucks, dirt bikes, tanks, and Santa's sleigh).<ref name=review-sfgate/> Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the driving avatar's head.<ref name=fvg-hac/>{{rp|271}} \n\nSince its inception, ''Hill Climb Racing'' has seen updates that add new content. For example, the garage was introduced in a December 2016 update, where players can purchase cars and tune their parts. Gems were also introduced as a currency of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/Fingersoft/status/811945488459112448|title=The Garage update for #HillClimbRacing is out now on Google Play and Apple App Store!|work=[[Twitter]]|publisher=Fingersoft|date=December 22, 2016|accessdate=August 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190817034013/https://mobile.twitter.com/Fingersoft/status/811945488459112448|archivedate=August 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n\n''Hill Climb Racing'' was developed by Toni Fingerroos, a self-taught Finnish programmer who was 29 years old at the time of the game's release. Prior to the game, he started writing software at the age of ten. He was intrigued by car racing, and wrote ''Ralli 94'' and shared it with his friends. At that time, when he thought that games were developed by firms and not by people, he named his own hobbyist firm Fingersoft.<ref name=wsj-Feb2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fingersoft-finds-simple-is-profitable-1391523498|title=Fingersoft Finds Simple Is Profitable|last=Rossi|first=Juhana|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name=ht-Oct2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/business/12409-turning-his-business-around.html|title=Turning his business around|last=Teivainen|first=Aleksi|work=[[Helsinki Times]]|date=October 18, 2014|accessdate=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA decade after his first game, Fingerroos revived the Fingersoft trade name as a professional studio that programmed games for [[Nokia]] mobile phones. Fingerroos described he \"failed at that quite miserably.\" He since pursued other occupations, all with unfavorable outcomes. One of them was working with Pixolane, a game studio, and spending his money on developing a [[PlayStation 3]] game called ''Rust Buckaneers''<ref name=fvg-hac/>{{rp|243}} that was ultimately cancelled as the studio wasted its seed money, which caused him to accumulate debt. Another was repairing and selling sports cars imported from Japan and the United Kingdom, which also drained his personal savings. Fingerroos returned to and revived again Fingersoft in late 2011, where as the company's sole worker, he designed a photography application every few days to see whether some of them would turn out to be successful. One of these apps was ''Cartoon Camera'', released in February 2012 and having quickly amassed over ten million downloads. The app's profitability strengthened Fingerroos' confidence, helped him pay off debts, and secured the creation of his next project, ''Hill Climb Racing''.<ref name=wsj-Feb2014/><ref name=ht-Oct2014/>\n\nFingerroos said he spent 16 hours a day for a couple of months developing ''Hill Climb Racing'' in a compact bedroom before completing the project.<ref name=ht-Oct2014/> The sound assets were [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]], and his friends and acquaintances drew the visuals.

From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, \"Lakewood\" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood], VillageProfile.com.

One such sawmill \u2013 located at the east end of the present [[Lake Carasaljo]] \u2013 was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, \"Lakewood\" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood], VillageProfile.com.

{"title_page": "Trial of Socrates", "text_new": "{{short description|399 B.C.E legal proceedings by the pantheon of Athens against Socrates}}\n{{for|the 2007 play|Socrates on Trial}}\n{{redirect|Death of Socrates|the painting|The Death of Socrates}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2012}}\n[[Image:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787), by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]\n\nThe '''trial of Socrates''' (399 BC) was held to determine the philosopher\u2019s guilt of two charges: ''[[Impiety|asebeia]]'' (impiety) against the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: \"failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges\" and \"introducing new deities\".\n\nThe death sentence of [[Socrates]] was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, which resulted in the two accusations of moral corruption and impiety. At trial, the majority of the ''[[dikast]]s'' (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates\u2019s drinking a poisonous beverage of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]].\n\nPrimary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' by [[Plato]] and the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]''  by [[Xenophon of Athens]], who had been his student; contemporary interpretations include ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988) by the journalist [[I. F. Stone]], and ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009) by the Classics scholar [[Robin Waterfield]].<ref>Stone, I.F. (1988). The Trial of Socrates. New York: Little, Brown. Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths by Robin Waterfield, Norton, 2009</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Socrates}}\nBefore the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, ''[[The Clouds]]'' (423 BC), [[Aristophanes]] represents Socrates as a [[Sophism|sophistic]] philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with [[Sophism]]. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, \"they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.\"<ref>Kerferd, G.B.''The Sophistic Movement''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009.6.</ref>\n\nBesides ''The Clouds'', the comic play ''[[The Wasps]]'' (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily.<ref> name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.\n\nSocrates left no written works, but his student and friend, [[Plato]], wrote [[Socratic dialogue]]s, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates's ''elenctic examination'' method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]].<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 21d\u2013e, 23a, 23e.</ref>\n\nOne will sometimes find the claim that Socrates described himself as the \"[[gadfly (social)|gadfly]]\" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his \"stinging\".<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 30e\u201331a.</ref>  In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., \"gadfly\" [Grk., ''[[:wiktionary:oestrus|o\u00eestros]]''])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi)=stros&la=greek&can=oi)=stros0&prior=oi)/stros#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> to describe himself.  Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (''proskeimenon t\u0113 polei'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=pro/skeimai |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> in order to sting it.<ref>See the Greek text in H.N.

Putnam's Sons, 1919), p. 112</ref>  Nevertheless, he does make the bold claim that he is a god's gift to the Athenians.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 31a-b</ref>\n\nSocrates' [[elenctic]] method was often imitated by the young men of Athens.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 23c.</ref>\n\n===Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants===\n[[Alcibiades]], an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] during the [[Peloponnesian Wars]], where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the [[Trireme]]s) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433\u2013429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years.<ref name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of [[psychopathy]]<ref>Anna C. Salter, ''Predators: Pedophiles, And Other Sex Offenders'', Basic Books, 2005, p. 128.</ref><ref>Hervey M. Cleckley. The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues about the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. Martino Fine Books; 2 edition (2015) (original ed. 1941)</ref>. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, Athens' arch-enemy, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta). He then defected back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing so). Finally driven out of Athens after the defeat of the [[Battle of Notium]] against Sparta, Alcibiades was assassinated in [[Phrygia]] in 404 BC by his Spartan enemies.\n\nAnother possible source of resentment was the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. [[Critias]], who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (the ruthless [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404\u2013403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.<ref>Xenophon. ''Memorabilia'', 1.2.29\u201338.</ref>\n\nAs with many of the issues surrounding Socrates' conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that \"Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the [[Pythagoreans]] who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.\"<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|183}} Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates\u2019 contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty\u2019s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty\u2019s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty.<ref name=Waterfield/> Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato\u2019s ''Apology'' has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. While Socrates did not obey this order, he did nothing to warn Leon, who was subsequently apprehended by the other four men.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 32c.</ref>\n\n=== Support for Oligarchic Rule and Contempt for Athenian Democracy ===\n\nAccording to the portraits left by some of Socrates' followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is [[Technocracy|possessed by only a few]].<ref>Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0208&layout=&loc=1.2.1 1.2.9]; Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+47c 47c\u2013d], ''Laches'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0176&layout=&loc=Lach.+184e 184e].</ref>  Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy;<ref>'' Gorgias'' 503c\u2013d, 515d\u2013517c.</ref> and even has him claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors, since it is not any group of ''many'' that benefits, but only \"someone or very few persons\".<ref>''Apology of Socrates'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Apol.+25a 25a-b].</ref>  Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].<ref>Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+52e 52e].</ref> Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', advocating rule by elite, enlightened \"Philosopher-Kings\".\n\nThe totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. [[Larry Gonick]], in his \"[[Cartoon History of the Universe]]\"<ref> Gonick, Larry. \"Cartoon History of the Universe Vol 1-7\". Volume 7 \u2013 All about Athens. Doubleday Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0385-26520-4}}.</ref> writes, \"''The trial of Socrates has always seemed mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates's real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... but of course he couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty'' (which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... ''so his accusers made it \"not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new gods, and corrupting the youth.''\"\n\nApart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his spirit, or ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimonion]]'', although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions.<ref>''Socrates Legacy''[https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/socrates]</ref>\n\n==Historical descriptions of the trial==\n{{Wikisource|Euthyphro}}\n{{Wikisource|Apology (Plato)}}\n{{Wikisource|Crito}}\n{{Wikisource|Phaedo}}\n\nThe extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', by Xenophon of Athens, a historian; and the [[tetralogy]] of Socratic dialogues \u2014 ''[[Euthyphro]]'', the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Socratic Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of [[Socrates]].\n\nIn ''The Indictment of Socrates'' (392 BC), the [[Sophism|sophist]] rhetorician [[Polycrates (sophist)|Polycrates]] (440\u2013370) presents the prosecution speech, by [[Anytus]], which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] before the year 403 BC. In presenting such a prosecution, which addressed matters external to the charges of moral corruption and impiety, for which the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' was trying Socrates, Anytus violated the political [[amnesty]] granted in the agreement of reconciliation (403\u2013402 BC)<ref>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York, 2009. p. 196.</ref> that granted amnesty to a man for political and religious actions taken before or during the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], \"under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the [reign of] terror were forbidden\".<ref>Martin, Thomas R. ''Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times''.

Although neither [[Plato]] nor [[Xenophon of Athens]] identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 500 men likely was the legal norm. In the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (36a\u2013b), about Socrates\u2019s defense at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b).<ref>The second point is tenable if Socrates\u2019s claim (36a\u2013b) entails that Meletus, Lycon, and Anytus each was responsible for one-third of the votes against Socrates, who implies that Meletus failed to persuade less than one-fifth of the judges. The jury of 500 or 501 men, based either on [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] (2.41) or on the Aristotelian ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenaion Politeia]]'' (68). See P. Rhodes, 1981, ''Commentary on the Aristotelian \"Athenaion Politeia\"'', p. 729.</ref>\n\nHaving been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the [[Prytaneum]] (the city\u2019s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of Athens, and for the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae\u2014one-fifth of his property\u2014which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment\u2014nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, 2.42).\n\nIn the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens. (''[[Crito]]'') Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death-sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: ''[[Phaedo]]'')\n\n==Interpretations of the trial of Socrates==\n===Ancient===\nIn the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] recently had perdured the trials and tribulations of Spartan [[hegemony]] and the thirteen-month r\u00e9gime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], imposed consequent to the Athenian defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC).

As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that, in a democracy, the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u2014even during times of war\u2014is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D.

At trial, the majority of the ''[[dikast]]s'' (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates\u2019s drinking a poisonous beverage of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]].\n\nPrimary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' by [[Plato]] and the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]''  by [[Xenophon of Athens]], who had been his student; contemporary interpretations include ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988) by the journalist [[I. F. Stone]], and ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009) by the Classics scholar [[Robin Waterfield]].<ref>Stone, I.F. (1988). The Trial of Socrates. New York: Little, Brown. Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths by Robin Waterfield, Norton, 2009</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Socrates}}\nBefore the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, ''[[The Clouds]]'' (423 BC), [[Aristophanes]] represents Socrates as a [[Sophism|sophistic]] philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with [[Sophism]]. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, \"they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.\"<ref>Kerferd, G.B.''The Sophistic Movement''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009.6.</ref>\n\nBesides ''The Clouds'', the comic play ''[[The Wasps]]'' (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily.<ref> name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.\n\nSocrates left no written works, but his student and friend, [[Plato]], wrote [[Socratic dialogue]]s, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates's ''elenctic examination'' method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]].<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 21d\u2013e, 23a, 23e.</ref>\n\nOne will sometimes find the claim that Socrates described himself as the \"[[gadfly (social)|gadfly]]\" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his \"stinging\".<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 30e\u201331a.</ref>  In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., \"gadfly\" [Grk., ''[[:wiktionary:oestrus|o\u00eestros]]''])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi)=stros&la=greek&can=oi)=stros0&prior=oi)/stros#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> to describe himself.  Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (''proskeimenon t\u0113 polei'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=pro/skeimai |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> in order to sting it.<ref>See the Greek text in H.N.

''Apology'', 23c.</ref>\n\n===Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants===\n[[Alcibiades]], an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] during the [[Peloponnesian Wars]], where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the [[Trireme]]s) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433\u2013429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years.<ref name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of [[psychopathy]]<ref>Anna C. Salter, ''Predators: Pedophiles, And Other Sex Offenders'', Basic Books, 2005, p. 128.</ref><ref>Hervey M. Cleckley. The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues about the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. Martino Fine Books; 2 edition (2015) (original ed. 1941)</ref>. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, Athens' arch-enemy, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta). He then defected back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing so). Finally driven out of Athens after the defeat of the [[Battle of Notium]] against Sparta, Alcibiades was assassinated in [[Phrygia]] in 404 BC by his Spartan enemies.\n\nAnother possible source of resentment was the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. [[Critias]], who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (the ruthless [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404\u2013403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.<ref>Xenophon. ''Memorabilia'', 1.2.29\u201338.</ref>\n\nAs with many of the issues surrounding Socrates' conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that \"Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the [[Pythagoreans]] who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.\"<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|183}} Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates\u2019 contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty\u2019s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty\u2019s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty.<ref name=Waterfield/> Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato\u2019s ''Apology'' has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. While Socrates did not obey this order, he did nothing to warn Leon, who was subsequently apprehended by the other four men.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 32c.</ref>\n\n=== Support for Oligarchic Rule and Contempt for Athenian Democracy ===\n\nAccording to the portraits left by some of Socrates' followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is [[Technocracy|possessed by only a few]].<ref>Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0208&layout=&loc=1.2.1 1.2.9]; Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+47c 47c\u2013d], ''Laches'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0176&layout=&loc=Lach.+184e 184e].</ref>  Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy;<ref>'' Gorgias'' 503c\u2013d, 515d\u2013517c.</ref> and even has him claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors, since it is not any group of ''many'' that benefits, but only \"someone or very few persons\".<ref>''Apology of Socrates'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Apol.+25a 25a-b].</ref>  Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].<ref>Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+52e 52e].</ref> Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', advocating rule by elite, enlightened \"Philosopher-Kings\".\n\nThe totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. [[Larry Gonick]], in his \"[[Cartoon History of the Universe]]\"<ref> Gonick, Larry. \"Cartoon History of the Universe Vol 1-7\". Volume 7 \u2013 All about Athens. Doubleday Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0385-26520-4}}.</ref> writes, \"''The trial of Socrates has always seemed mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates's real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... but of course he couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty'' (which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... ''so his accusers made it \"not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new gods, and corrupting the youth.''\"\n\nApart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his spirit, or ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimonion]]'', although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions.<ref>''Socrates Legacy''[https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/socrates]</ref>\n\n==Historical descriptions of the trial==\n{{Wikisource|Euthyphro}}\n{{Wikisource|Apology (Plato)}}\n{{Wikisource|Crito}}\n{{Wikisource|Phaedo}}\n\nThe extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', by Xenophon of Athens, a historian; and the [[tetralogy]] of Socratic dialogues \u2014 ''[[Euthyphro]]'', the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Socratic Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of [[Socrates]].\n\nIn ''The Indictment of Socrates'' (392 BC), the [[Sophism|sophist]] rhetorician [[Polycrates (sophist)|Polycrates]] (440\u2013370) presents the prosecution speech, by [[Anytus]], which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] before the year 403 BC.

Although neither [[Plato]] nor [[Xenophon of Athens]] identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 500 men likely was the legal norm. In the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (36a\u2013b), about Socrates\u2019s defense at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b).<ref>The second point is tenable if Socrates\u2019s claim (36a\u2013b) entails that Meletus, Lycon, and Anytus each was responsible for one-third of the votes against Socrates, who implies that Meletus failed to persuade less than one-fifth of the judges. The jury of 500 or 501 men, based either on [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] (2.41) or on the Aristotelian ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenaion Politeia]]'' (68). See P. Rhodes, 1981, ''Commentary on the Aristotelian \"Athenaion Politeia\"'', p. 729.</ref>\n\nHaving been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the [[Prytaneum]] (the city\u2019s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of Athens, and for the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae\u2014one-fifth of his property\u2014which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment\u2014nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, 2.42).\n\nIn the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens. (''[[Crito]]'') Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death-sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: ''[[Phaedo]]'')\n\n==Interpretations of the trial of Socrates==\n===Ancient===\nIn the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] recently had perdured the trials and tribulations of Spartan [[hegemony]], the thirteen-month r\u00e9gime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], imposed consequent to the Athenian defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC). At the request of the pro\u2013Sparta [[Lysander]], a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by [[Critias]] and [[Theramenes]], were installed to govern Athens, and to revise the city\u2019s democratic laws, which were inscribed to a wall of the [[Stoa Basileios]]; their political actions meant to facilitate the subordination of Athenian government\u2014from [[democracy]] to [[oligarchy]]\u2014in service to [[Sparta]].<ref>Xenophon, [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15\u201316]</ref>\n\nMoreover, the Thirty Tyrants also appointed a council of 500 men to perform the judicial functions that once had belonged to every Athenian citizen.<ref name=AC35.1>[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.html Aristotle, ''Athenian Constitution'', 35.1 (350 BC).]</ref><ref>Krentz, Peter.

Stone. ''The Trial of Socrates'', 1988.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988), [[I. F. Stone]] said that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.\n\nIn the play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' (2007), Andrew Irvine said that for loyalty to Athenian democracy, Socrates willingly accepted the guilty-verdict voted by the jurors of his trial. \"During a time of war, and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views, openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that, in a democracy, the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u2014even during times of war\u2014is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D.  Introduction, ''Socrates on Trial'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009), [[Robin Waterfield]] said that the death of Socrates was an act of volition motivated by a greater purpose; Socrates \"saw himself as healing the City\u2019s ills by his voluntary death\".<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|204}} Waterfield said that Socrates, with his unconventional methods of [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] enquiry, attempted to resolve the political confusion then occurring in the city-state of Athens, by willingly being the scapegoat, whose death would quiet old disputes, which then would allow progress towards political harmony and social peace for the Athenian polis.<ref name=Waterfield/>\n\nIn ''The New Trial of Socrates'' (2012), an international panel of ten judges held a [[Mock trial|mock re-trial]] of Socrates to resolve the matter of the charges leveled against him by [[Meletus]], [[Anytus]], and [[Apology (Plato)|Lycon]], that: \"Socrates is a doer of evil and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and he believes in other new divinities of his own\"; by split decision, five judges voted \"guilty\" and five judges voted \"not guilty\", which acquitted Socrates of corruption of the young and of impiety against the Athenian pantheon. Limiting themselves to the facts of the case against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence; the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for Socrates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Socrates acquitted in ancient trial re-run |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |publisher=Google/AFP |date=25 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130161519/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |archivedate=January 30, 2014 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120614034706/http://www.sgt.gr/en/programme/event/688 The New Trial of Socrates.] Onassis Cultural Centre</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Meno]]\n* [[Phaedo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Socrates and Legal Obligation|last=Allen|first=Reginald E.|year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}\n* {{cite book|title=Socrates on Trial|last=Brickhouse|first=Thomas C.|year=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Trial and Execution of Socrates: Sources and Controversies |last= Brickhouse |first= Thomas C. |last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas D.|year= 2002 |publisher= Oxford University |location= New York }}\n* {{cite book|title=Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Plato and the Trial of Socrates|last=Brickhouse|first=Thomas C.|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas D.|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}\n* {{cite book|title=Plato's Affair with Tragedy|last=Cameron|first=Alister|year=1978|publisher=University of Cincinnati|location=Cincinnati}}\n* {{cite book |title= Socrates Against Athens |last= Colaiaco |first= James A. |year= 2001 |publisher= Routledge |location= New York}}\n* {{cite book|title=Reexamining Socrates in the Apology|last=Fagan|first=Patricia|last2=Russon|first2=John|year=2009|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston}}\n* Filonik, Jakub (2013). {{doi|10.13130/1128-8221/4290}} \"Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal\".
