Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes and is used to remove material from surfaces, either to make them smoother (for example, in [[house painter and decorator|painting]] and [[wood finishing]]), to remove a layer of material (such as old [[paint]]), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for [[adhesive|gluing]]). It is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper, e.g. \"aluminium oxide paper\", or \"silicon carbide paper\".\n\nThe grit size of sandpaper is usually stated as a number that is inversely related to the particle size. A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a coarse grit, while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.\n\n== History ==\nThe first recorded instance of sandpaper was in 13th-century [[China]] when crushed shells, seeds, and [[sand]] were bonded to parchment using [[natural gum]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casey |first1=Don |title=Know How: Sandpapers and Sanding |journal=Sail Magazine |date=May 3, 2016 |url=https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/know-sandpapers-sanding |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref>  In the Bible, [[Solomon]] is mentioned to have used a mysterious abrasive called ''shamir'' allowing the king to build his temple without using iron tools.

Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while [[mylar]] is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from \"A\" to \"F\", with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.\n\n===Type of abrasive===\nTypes of abrasive materials include:\n* [[glass]]: no longer commonly used\n* [[flint]]: no longer commonly used\n* [[garnet]]: commonly used in [[woodworking]]\n* [[emery (mineral)|emery]]: commonly used to abrade or polish metals\n* [[aluminium oxide]]: The most common in modern use, with the widest variety of grits, lowest unit cost; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood\n* [[silicon carbide]]: available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications\n* alumina-zirconia: (an aluminium oxide\u2013[[zirconium oxide]] alloy), used for machine grinding applications\n* [[chromium(III) oxide]]: used in extremely fine micron grit ([[micrometre]] level) papers\n* [[diamond]]: used for finishing and polishing hard metals, ceramics and glass\n* [[ceramic aluminum oxide]]: used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.\n\nSandpaper may be \"[[stearate]]d\" where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate \"[[soap]]\" prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper.\n\nThe harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood. The grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than [[granite]].\n\n===Bonds===\nDifferent adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. [[Animal glue#Hide glue|Hide glue]] is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. '''Waterproof sandpapers''' or '''wet/dry sandpapers''' use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.\n\nSandpapers can also be '''open coat''', where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper. Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface. Arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling.\n\n===Shapes===\n\nSandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:\n\n* sheet: usually {{convert|9|by|11|in|cm}}, but other sizes may be available\n* belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different [[belt sander]]s.\n* disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and \"[[Hook and loop fastener|hook-and-loop]]\" (similar to Velcro).\n* rolls: known as \"shag rolls\" by many contractors\n* sponge: for tight places\n\n==Grit sizes==\nGrit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. These measurements are determined by the amount of the abrasive material that can fit through a square inch filter<ref>{{cite web |title=Sandpaper Grit |url=https://www.empireabrasives.com/blog/sandpaper-grit/ |website=Empire Abrasives |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) \"P\" grade. The FEPA system is the same as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 6344|6344]] standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The \"aught\" system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.\n\n===Grit size table===\nThe following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and \"P\" designations with the average grit size in micrometres (\u00b5m).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Grit size table\n!\n!ISO/FEPA Grit designation\n!CAMI Grit designation\n!Average particle diameter (\u00b5m)\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MACROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"9\"|Extra Coarse (Very fast removal of material, [[hardwood flooring]] initial sanding)\n|align=\"center\"|P12\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1815\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P16\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1324\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P20\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P24\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|764\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|708\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P30\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|642\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|align=\"center\"|632\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|align=\"center\"|530\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P36\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|538\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"3\"|Coarse (Rapid removal of material)\n|align=\"center\"|P40\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|align=\"center\"|425\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|348\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P50\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|336\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Medium (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, for gentle removal of varnish, also used for skateboard grip tape)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|align=\"center\"|265\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P60\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|269\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P80\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|201\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|80\n|align=\"center\"|190\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Fine (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, not suitable for removing varnish or paint from wood, use for cleaning plaster and water stain from wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P100\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|162\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|align=\"center\"|140\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P120\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|125\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|120\n|align=\"center\"|115\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Very Fine (sanding of bare wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P150\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|150\n|align=\"center\"|92\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P180\n|align=\"center\"|180\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P220\n|align=\"center\"|220\n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MICROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Very Fine (sanding finishes between coats)\n|align=\"center\"|P240\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|58.5\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|240\n|align=\"center\"|53.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P280\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|52.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P320\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|46.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P360\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|40.5\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Extra fine, start polishing of wood \n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|320\n|align=\"center\"|36.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P400\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|35.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30.2\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|360\n|align=\"center\"|28.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P600\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|25.8\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"6\"|Super fine (final sanding of finishes, final sanding of wood)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|400\n|align=\"center\"|23.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P800\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|21.8\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|500\n|align=\"center\"|20.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1000\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|18.3\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|600\n|align=\"center\"|16.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1200\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|15.3\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Ultra fine (final sanding and polishing of thick finishes)\n|align=\"center\"|P1500\n|align=\"center\"|800\n|align=\"center\"|12.6\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2000\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|align=\"center\"|10.3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|8.4\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n=== Similar to sandpaper ===\n* [[Emery cloth]]\n* [[Crocus cloth]]\n\n=== Tools used with sandpaper ===\n* [[Sanding block]]\n* [[Sander]]\n* [[Belt sander]]\n\n=== Related processes and tools ===\n* [[Polishing]]\n* [[Grind]]ing\n* [[Grinding machine]]\n* [[Rotary tool]]\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n* [[Sanding sealer]]\n* [[Emery (mineral)]]\n* [[Particle size (grain size)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Michael Dresdner (1992).

Unlike the \"[[sweat equity]]\" required by which some housing programs such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] (where inhabitants are required to take part in the construction of their future dwelling), Mad Houser shelters are provided free of any charge or obligation to their inhabitants.

One day, a fight broke out between the residents and one person was knifed.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  The Department of Transportation, who owned the land, decided that it was an unacceptable risk to allow the huts to remain.  A debate ensued among the Mad Housers as to what to do about the situation.  Pope wanted to go to the media and publicize the injustice of kicking the people out.  However, they ended up following Finkel's suggestion to not make a big deal out of it and simply move the huts somewhere safe.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  In July 1988, they participated in a demonstration for the homeless at the [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Since then, they have continued to bring \"the plight of the homeless to public attention\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  Then, in 1990, an hour-long documentary aired on 90 TV stations around the nation dramatizing the Mad Houser's work.<ref name=\"Krasner\">Krasner, Mike. \"'The Mad Housers' grapples with issue of homelessness :[ALL Edition]. \" Telegram & Gazette  [Worcester, Mass.] 28  Mar. 1990, D5.

Another factor contributing to the lull in the group's activity was the [[1996 Olympics]] when most of the homeless in Atlanta were removed from the city.  Pope said that the group became more focused on maintaining the current huts.  While they still built huts, they \"became more of a [[landlord]] than a development organization.\"  Frank Jeffers, a longtime member and president of the organization for many years helped develop items such as a [[cogeneration]] power generator out of a lawnmower and a wood stove to heat the huts.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />\nToday the Mad Housers are still very active in providing shelter for the homeless and have panel builds and hut raisings regularly.  They also do site recon trips to find new sites and \"[[winterization]]\" of the huts when they prepare the huts for the impending cold weather.  In 2002, to raise awareness about homelessness in Atlanta, they built a hut on the [[Georgia Tech]] campus and slept in it that night.<ref name=\"MHYahoo\" />\n\n== Phenomenology of the huts ==\n\n[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], as described by David Seamon, \"seeks to understand how people live in relation to everyday places, spaces, and environments.\" <ref name=\"Seamon\">Seamon, David. \"Body Subject, Time-Space Routines, and Place-Ballets\"</ref>  This concept certainly applies to the clients of the Mad Housers.  Multiple accounts describe how the clients interact with their new space and repurpose it.  The clients were skeptical at first about whether it was too good to be true, but once they were convinced, they were very enthusiastic about their new homes.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  Several articles mention how the clients arrange their personal possessions in their hut with special significance because they did not have that luxury before.<ref name=\"AJC\" /><ref name=\"Anderson2\">Anderson, Kristine F. \"A Hut Resident and a Mad Houser Coordinator.\" The Christian Science Monitor  14  June 1989,13. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  Having a hut is a transformational experience for the clients.  One hut dweller said \"the power of a hut is what it does for your self-esteem. In a shelter, you can't make someone a cup of instant coffee, invite them in, ask them if they read this article or this book. When you have a hut, you can say, 'This is my place.\"<ref name=\"Progressive\">\"The Power of the Hut. \" The Progressive  1 November 1992:  13. Research Library.

The communities were given police and sanitation service.  Pope realized the extent to which the huts were transformational when he saw one of the clients sitting on his porch watching the sunset.  Pope said the man \"couldn't have been happier.\"<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071118044151/http://www.madhousers.org/index.shtml The Mad Housers Web site]\n*[http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0544,interview,69500,24.html ''Village Voice'' article about the Mad Housers (2005)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071203223158/http://www.nique.net/issues/2007-11-30/focus/3 'Technique' Article about a Georgia Tech Research Project on the Mad Housers (2008)]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Squatting}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Homelessness charities]]\n[[Category:Squatting in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Squatting in the United States}}\n\n'''Mad Housers, Inc.''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]] based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and engaged in [[Charity (practice)|charitable work]], research and education.

Another factor contributing to the lull in the group's activity was the [[1996 Olympics]] when most of the homeless in Atlanta were removed from the city.  Pope said that the group became more focused on maintaining the current huts.  While they still built huts, they \"became more of a [[landlord]] than a development organization.\"  Frank Jeffers, a longtime member and president of the organization for many years helped develop items such as a [[cogeneration]] power generator out of a lawnmower and a wood stove to heat the huts.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />\nToday the Mad Housers are still very active in providing shelter for the homeless and have panel builds and hut raisings regularly.  They also do site recon trips to find new sites and \"[[winterization]]\" of the huts when they prepare the huts for the impending cold weather.  In 2002, to raise awareness about homelessness in Atlanta, they built a hut on the [[Georgia Tech]] campus and slept in it that night.<ref name=\"MHYahoo\" />\n\n== Phenomenology of the huts ==\n\n[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], as described by David Seamon, \"seeks to understand how people live in relation to everyday places, spaces, and environments.\" <ref name=\"Seamon\">Seamon, David. \"Body Subject, Time-Space Routines, and Place-Ballets\"</ref>  This concept certainly applies to the clients of the Mad Housers.  Multiple accounts describe how the clients interact with their new space and repurpose it.  The clients were skeptical at first about whether it was too good to be true, but once they were convinced, they were very enthusiastic about their new homes.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  Several articles mention how the clients arrange their personal possessions in their hut with special significance because they did not have that luxury before.<ref name=\"AJC\" /><ref name=\"Anderson2\">Anderson, Kristine F. \"A Hut Resident and a Mad Houser Coordinator.\" The Christian Science Monitor  14  June 1989,13. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  Having a hut is a transformational experience for the clients.  One hut dweller said \"the power of a hut is what it does for your self-esteem. In a shelter, you can't make someone a cup of instant coffee, invite them in, ask them if they read this article or this book. When you have a hut, you can say, 'This is my place.\"<ref name=\"Progressive\">\"The Power of the Hut. \" The Progressive  1 November 1992:  13. Research Library.

The communities were given police and sanitation service.  Pope realized the extent to which the huts were transformational when he saw one of the clients sitting on his porch watching the sunset.  Pope said the man \"couldn't have been happier.\"<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071118044151/http://www.madhousers.org/index.shtml The Mad Housers Web site]\n*[http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0544,interview,69500,24.html ''Village Voice'' article about the Mad Housers (2005)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071203223158/http://www.nique.net/issues/2007-11-30/focus/3 'Technique' Article about a Georgia Tech Research Project on the Mad Housers (2008)]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n{{Squatting}}\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Homelessness charities]]\n[[Category:Squatting in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Update date format tag and add authority control template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Housers"}

At first, settlers preferred the southern areas where wood was available.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 16.</ref> The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The [[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]] covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19th&nbsp;century, settlers found the barrens to be fertile farmland, and they were quickly settled. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20th&nbsp;century the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.<ref>Roose 1911, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nA large [[Meteorite fall|meteorite]] fell near Buena Vista on March 28, 1859.

When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed to make way for a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the [[Indiana first capitol building|first state capitol building]]. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000.{{#tag:ref|A $250,000 capital expense in 1928 would be roughly equivalent to $14,500,000 in 2010.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H.

Executive and legislative power is vested in the Board of Commissioners, and fiscal power is vested in the County Council.<ref name = inc3623/>\n\nThe seven member county council is the fiscal branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local income, property, excise and service taxes. County income and property taxes are subject to state level approval.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe Board of Commissioners consists of three commissioners who are elected county-wide in four\u2013year staggered terms. One commissioner serves as president of the board. The commissioners manage the budget set forth by the council, the collection of revenue, enact and repeal ordinances, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government. The commissioners meet twice monthly.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>\n\nHarrison County has a Circuit Court and a Superior Court. The Superior Court handles adult criminal cases, small claims cases, traffic tickets, and infractions. The Circuit Court handles the rest of the cases in the county, including most of the divorce cases, juvenile matters, CHINS cases, civil proceedings, probate, estates, adoptions and civil commitments. Judges in each court serve a six-year term. The Judge of the Circuit Court appoints a referee to handle family law cases.<ref name=inc2102/>\n\nThe county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]] and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each serves a four\u2013year term. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>\n\nEach township has a [[Indiana Township Trustee|trustee]] who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unitedtownships.org/?page_id=95|title=Government|publisher=United Township Association of Indiana|accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMost of Harrison County lies in State House District 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3005.htm|title=Indiana House Districts|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> Blue River Township is part of State House District 73.

[[Horseshoe Southern Indiana]] is the largest employer, followed by [[Tyson Foods]] and the Harrison County Hospital. Tourism plays a significant role in the economy and is centered on the county's many historic sites. County government is divided among several bodies including the boards of the county's three school districts, three elected commissioners who exercise legislative and executive powers, an elected county council that controls the county budget, a circuit and superior court, and township trustees in the county's 12 townships. The county has 10 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] towns with a total population of over 5,000, as well as many small unincorporated towns. One Interstate highway and one U. S.

The population grew rapidly during first decade of the 19th&nbsp;century. Corydon was officially platted in 1808 and became the capital of the [[Indiana Territory]] in 1813. Many of the state's early important historic events occurred in the county, including the writing of Indiana's first constitution. Corydon was the state capital until 1825, but in the years afterward remained an important hub for southern Indiana.

A tow-and-ferry line was operated there by the Mauck family bringing settlers into the county from [[Kentucky]]. This road and ferry greatly expanded the county's economic viability and ease of access to the outside world, leading to a rapid settlement of the area. The county's population more than doubled in the following decade.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 7.</ref>\n\n[[Dennis Pennington]], who lived near [[Lanesville, Indiana|Lanesville]], became one of the county's early leading citizens and speaker of the territory's legislature.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 12.</ref> Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May 1, 1813, after Pennington suggested that it would be safer than Vincennes.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 16.</ref> For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.<ref name=IHI/>\n\nThe first division of the county occurred in 1814 when the northern portion of the county was separated to become Washington County. In 1818 with the western part of the county was partitioned off to become Crawford County.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 124.</ref> In 1819 Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 129.</ref> Since that time, Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through land transactions with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.\n\nThe northern part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for its scarce timber. At first, settlers preferred the southern areas where wood was available.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 16.</ref> The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The [[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]] covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19th&nbsp;century, settlers found the barrens to be fertile farmland, and they were quickly settled. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20th&nbsp;century the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.<ref>Roose 1911, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nA large [[Meteorite fall|meteorite]] fell near Buena Vista on March 28, 1859.

Confederate artillery returned fire from the opposite shore, and the Legion retreated towards Corydon. The citizens of Mauckport fled the town carrying their valuables.<ref name=f86/> Morgan landed on the east side of Mauckport with two thousand cavalry and marched north burning homes, farms, and mills.<ref name=f86/> The county militia made a stand to block his advance on the county seat and the resulting conflict is known as the [[Battle of Corydon]]. The battle was won by the Confederates and the town of Corydon was then sacked and stores were looted and ransomed. The battle left 4&nbsp;dead, 12&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref name=f87>Funk 1969, p. 87.</ref> After the battle Morgan continued into northern Harrison County where he looted the New Salisbury area with the main body of troops. Crandall and Palmyra were robbed and sacked by detachments. His forces left the county the following day; they were eventually defeated and captured by Union Army forces.<ref name=f87/>\n[[File:Corydonwarmememorial.jpg|left|thumb|The Harrison County memorial to the county's war casualties]]\n\nThe railroad reached Harrison County in 1869.

It operated as a tourist attraction until its 2003 closing, which ended passenger service in the county.<ref>Longest 2005, p. 91.</ref>\n\nThe first county courthouse was a small log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed to make way for a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the [[Indiana first capitol building|first state capitol building]]. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000.{{#tag:ref|A $250,000 capital expense in 1928 would be roughly equivalent to $14,500,000 in 2010.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H.

The [[Ohio River]] defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of [[Kentucky]] and the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. The [[Blue River (Indiana)|Blue River]] runs along the county's western border. According to the 2010&nbsp;census, the county has a total area of {{convert|486.52|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|484.52|sqmi}} (or 99.59%) is land and {{convert|2.00|sqmi}} (or 0.41%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n[[Harrison Spring]] is located west of Corydon; it is {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and is over {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep, making it the largest and deepest spring in Indiana. It rises from a solid rock in a level spot of land, and it outputs enough water to have turned flour mills in the past. Is the largest spring by volume in Indiana producing over 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of water daily. The name recognizes William Henry Harrison, who owned this area.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHarrison County is hilly in parts. The [[Knobstone Escarpment]] begins in the southeastern part of the county, rises sharply at the Ohio River, and runs along the eastern edge of the county.

Executive and legislative power is vested in the Board of Commissioners, and fiscal power is vested in the County Council.<ref name = inc3623/>\n\nThe seven member county council is the fiscal branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local income, property, excise and service taxes. County income and property taxes are subject to state level approval.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe Board of Commissioners consists of three commissioners who are elected county-wide in four\u2013year staggered terms. One commissioner serves as president of the board. The commissioners manage the budget set forth by the council, the collection of revenue, enact and repeal ordinances, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government. The commissioners meet twice monthly.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>\n\nHarrison County has a Circuit Court and a Superior Court. The Superior Court handles adult criminal cases, small claims cases, traffic tickets, and infractions. The Circuit Court handles the rest of the cases in the county, including most of the divorce cases, juvenile matters, CHINS cases, civil proceedings, probate, estates, adoptions and civil commitments. Judges in each court serve a six-year term. The Judge of the Circuit Court appoints a referee to handle family law cases.<ref name=inc2102/>\n\nThe county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]] and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each serves a four\u2013year term. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>\n\nEach township has a [[Indiana Township Trustee|trustee]] who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel. Owner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel. Owner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest.

I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel. Owner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes.

The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.\n\nMany possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow.

While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.\n\nBecause about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.<ref>Owens, Brian, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 10 May 2017.</ref>\n\nThe melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.\n\n===Effect on early evolution===\n[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]\nThe [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have \"pumped\" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].\n\nOne hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580\u2013850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.<ref>Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.

A number of unanswered questions remain, including whether the Earth was a full snowball, or a \"slushball\" with a thin equatorial band of open (or seasonally open) water.\n\nThe snowball-Earth episodes are proposed to have occurred before the sudden [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of multicellular bioforms known as the [[Cambrian explosion]]. The most recent snowball episode may have triggered the evolution of multicellularity. Another, much earlier and longer snowball episode, the [[Huronian glaciation]], which would have occurred 2400 to 2100&nbsp;Mya, may have been triggered by the first appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, the \"[[Great Oxygenation Event]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{Life timeline}}\n\n===Evidence for ancient glaciation mounts===\nLong before the idea of a global glaciation was established, a series of discoveries began to accumulate evidence for ancient Precambrian glaciations. The first of these discoveries was published in 1871 by J. Thomson who found ancient glacier-reworked material ([[tillite]]) in [[Islay]], Scotland. Similar findings followed in Australia (1884) and India (1887). A fourth and very illustrative finding that came to be known as \"[[Reusch's Moraine]]\" was reported by [[Hans Reusch]] in northern Norway in 1891. Many other findings followed, but their understanding was hampered by the rejection of [[continental drift]].<ref name=Hoffman2011>{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Paul F.|author-link=Paul F.

With the advancement of the [[continental drift]] hypothesis, and eventually [[plate tectonic]] theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments\u2014they were deposited at a time when the continents were at higher latitudes.\n\nIn 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when [[W.

Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium.<ref name=\"Budyko\">{{cite journal\n| author=M.I.

Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the [[tropics]] suggests global ice cover.\n\nCritical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:\n# that a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;\n# that the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.\n\nDuring a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.\n\nThis last point is very difficult to prove. Before the [[Ediacaran]], the [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time.

In addition to considerations of how the recognizable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.\n\nWhen [[sedimentary rock]]s form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align themselves with the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Through the precise measurement of this [[palaeomagnetism]], it is possible to estimate the [[latitude]] (but not the [[longitude]]) where the rock matrix was formed.

Depending on the rate of cooling of [[structure of the Earth|Earth's core]], it is possible that during the Proterozoic, the [[magnetic field]] did not approximate a simple [[dipole|dipolar]] distribution, with north and south magnetic poles roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2010.02.038| title = Incompatible Ediacaran paleomagnetic directions suggest an equatorial geomagnetic dipole hypothesis| year = 2010| last1 = Abrajevitch | first1 = A.| last2 = Van Der Voo | first2 = R.| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 293| issue = 1\u20132| pages = 164\u2013170| bibcode=2010E&PSL.293..164A}}</ref>\n\nAnother weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building [[orogeny]] releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature.

In the presence of oxygen, [[iron]] naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.\n\nThe bands were produced at the [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] between an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is [[oxygen]]-rich (nearly 21% by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Palaeoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with [[Cryogenian]] glacial deposits.\n\nFor such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as [[ferrous oxide]]) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as [[ferric]] oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere.

This would weather exposed [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of [[calcium]], which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an [[abiotic]] \"[[cap carbonate]]\" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the snowball Earth hypothesis.\n\nHowever, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within\u2014starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations. The cause is further weakened by the lack of cap carbonates above many sequences of clear glacial origin at a similar time and the occurrence of similar carbonates within the sequences of proposed glacial origin.<ref name=Eyles2004 /> An alternative mechanism, which may have produced the [[Doushantuo]] cap carbonate at least, is the rapid, widespread release of methane.

The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.\n\nMany possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen [[equator]] as cold as modern [[Antarctica]].\n\n[[Global warming]] associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require as little as a millennium.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Continental distribution===\nA tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a snowball Earth.<ref name=Hoffman2005/>\nFirstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.<ref name=Jacobsen2001>{{cite journal\n| author = Jacobsen, S.B.\n| year = 2001\n| title = Earth science.

Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.\n\nContinental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies.

While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.\n\nBecause about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.<ref>Owens, Brian, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 10 May 2017.</ref>\n\nThe melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.\n\n===Effect on early evolution===\n[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]\nThe [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have \"pumped\" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].\n\nOne hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580\u2013850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.<ref>Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.
