He also began going by the name \"Woody Allen\".<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|539}} One of those writers was [[Abe Burrows]], coauthor of ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', who wrote, \"Wow! His stuff was dazzling.\" Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to [[Sid Caesar]], [[Phil Silvers]], and [[Peter Lind Hayes]], who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|541}}\n\nAs a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on ''The NBC Comedy Hour'' in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.<ref name=\"timemag\" /> He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954\u20131957), and other television shows.<ref name=\"Lax Bio\" />{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week.

When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with \"reams of paper\", according to producer [[Max Liebman]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}} Similarly, after he wrote for [[Bob Hope]], Hope called him \"half a genius\".<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}}\n\nHis daily writing routine could last as long as 15 hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary.

When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|551}} He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: \"Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can't wait to fill it!

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996).

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films.

As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

Kingsbury]] recommended that five faculty members be dismissed after a graduation speaker made a speech critical of Utah governor [[William Spry]]. One third of the faculty resigned in protest of these dismissals. Some{{Who|date=November 2017}} felt that the dismissals were a result of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]' influence on the university, while others{{Who|date=November 2017}} felt that they reflected a more general pattern of repressing religious and political expression that might be deemed offensive. The controversy was largely resolved when Kingsbury resigned in 1916, but university operations were again interrupted by World War I, and later [[The Great Depression]] and World War II. Student enrollment dropped to a low of 3,418 during the last year of World War II, but [[A. Ray Olpin]] made substantial additions to campus following the war, and enrollment reached 12,000 by the time he retired in 1964.

Kingsbury]] recommended that five faculty members be dismissed after a graduation speaker made a speech critical of Utah governor [[William Spry]]. One third of the faculty resigned in protest of these dismissals. Some{{Who|date=November 2017}} felt that the dismissals were a result of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]' influence on the university, while others{{Who|date=November 2017}} felt that they reflected a more general pattern of repressing religious and political expression that might be deemed offensive. The controversy was largely resolved when Kingsbury resigned in 1916, but university operations were again interrupted by World War I, and later [[The Great Depression]] and World War II. Student enrollment dropped to a low of 3,418 during the last year of World War II, but [[A. Ray Olpin]] made substantial additions to campus following the war, and enrollment reached 12,000 by the time he retired in 1964.

Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium mining in Canada|uranium]], [[Canadian diamonds|diamonds]], [[lead]], and in recent years, [[petroleum industry in Canada|crude petroleum]], which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[Encana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] business.\n\nThe reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.<ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>\n\nNatural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating overutilization the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.\n\n=== Data ===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132018.

Measures of productivity include [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP)(OECD 2008,11) and [[multifactor productivity]].\n\n===Multifactor productivity===\n\nAnother productivity measure, used by the OECD, is the long-term trend in multifactor productivity (MFP) also known as [[total factor productivity]] (TFP). This indicator assesses an economy's \"underlying productive capacity ('potential output'), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures\". MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)\n\nAccording to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor. Raising MFP growth is \"needed to sustain rising living standards, especially as the population ages\".<ref name=OECD2012>{{cite report|title=OECD Economic Surveys Canada June 2012 Overview |url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616120842/http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-16 |format=PDF |year=2012 |publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Bank of Canada==\nThe mandate of the central bank\u2014the [[Bank of Canada]] is to conduct monetary policy that \"preserves the value of money by keeping inflation low and stable\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/|title=Bank of Canada|website=www.bankofcanada.ca}}</ref><ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\"/>\n\n===Monetary Policy Report===\nThe Bank of Canada issues its bank rate announcement through its [[Monetary Policy Report (Canada)|Monetary Policy Report]] which is released eight times a year.<ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\">{{cite report |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-2015-07-15.pdf |format=PDF |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |title=Monetary Policy Report}}</ref> The [[Bank of Canada]], a federal crown corporation, has the responsibility of Canada's monetary system.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/> Under the [[inflation targeting|inflation-targeting]] monetary policy that has been the cornerstone of Canada's monetary and fiscal policy since the early 1990s, the Bank of Canada sets an inflation target<ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\" /><ref name=\"inflation-targeting_2010\">{{citation |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/inflation_control_target.pdf |title=Inflation-Control Target Backgrounder |publisher=Bank of Canada |date=November 2010}}</ref> The inflation target was set at 2 per cent, which is the midpoint of an inflation range of 1 to 3 per cent.

All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for.\n\n==Free-trade agreements==\n{{Main|Free-trade agreements of Canada}}\n[[File:FTAs with Canada.svg|thumb|right|275px|{{Legend|#000|Canada}}{{Legend|#393|Free-trade areas}}]]\n\n===Free-trade agreements in force===\n\n:Source:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*[[Canada\u2013U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 12 October 1987, entered into force 1 January 1989, later superseded by NAFTA)\n*[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1994, includes Canada, U.S. and Mexico)\n*[[Canada\u2013Israel Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1997, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 5 July 1997)\n*[[Canada\u2013Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 November 2002, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013European Free Trade Association Free Trade Agreement]] (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; entered into force 01-Jul-2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Peru Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 August 2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Colombia Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 21 November 2008, entered into force 15 August 2011; Canada's ratification of this FTA had been dependent upon Colombia's ratification of the \"Agreement Concerning Annual Reports on Human Rights and Free Trade Between Canada and the Republic of Colombia\" signed on 27 May 2010)\n*Canada\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement (Signed on 28 June 2009, entered into force 1 October 2012)\n*[[Canada\u2013Panama Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 14 May 2010, entered into force 1 April 2013)\n*[[Canada\u2013South Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 11 March 2014, entered into force 1 January 2015)\n*[[Canada\u2013Ukraine Free Trade Agreement]] (concluded 14 July 2015, entered into force 1 August 2017)\n*[[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (signed 8 March 2018, entered into force 30 December 2018)\n\n===Free-trade agreements concluded===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |access-date=March 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*[[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (concluded 5 October 2015, superseded by CPTPP)\n*[[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (concluded 5 August 2014)\n*[[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement]] (to supersede NAFTA, concluded 30 November 2018)\n\n===Ongoing free-trade agreements negotiations===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\"/>\nCanada is negotiating bilateral FTAs with the following countries respectively trade blocs:\n*Caribbean Community ([[CARICOM]])\n*[[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]]\n*[[Dominican Republic]]\n*[[India]]\n*[[Japan]]<ref>{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2011/02/23/canada-japan-free-trade.html |title=Canada, Japan study free-trade pact|publisher=CBC News |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>\n*[[Morocco]]\n*[[Singapore]]\n*[[Andean Community]] (FTA's are already in force with Peru and Colombia)\n\nCanada has been involved in negotiations to create the following regional trade blocks:\n\n*Canada and Central American Free Trade Agreement\n*[[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA)\n\n==Political issues==\n=== Relations with the U.S. ===\n{{Main|Canada\u2013United States trade relations}}\nCanada and the United States share a common trading relationship.

Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium mining in Canada|uranium]], [[Canadian diamonds|diamonds]], [[lead]], and in recent years, [[petroleum industry in Canada|crude petroleum]], which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[Encana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] business.\n\nThe reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.<ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>\n\nNatural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating overutilization the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.\n\n=== Data ===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132018.

Measures of productivity include [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP)(OECD 2008,11) and [[multifactor productivity]].\n\n===Multifactor productivity===\n\nAnother productivity measure, used by the OECD, is the long-term trend in multifactor productivity (MFP) also known as [[total factor productivity]] (TFP). This indicator assesses an economy's \"underlying productive capacity ('potential output'), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures\". MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)\n\nAccording to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor.

This makes Canada the world's sixth-largest producer of electricity generated by nuclear power, producing 95 TWh in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 15 Nuclear Generating Countries|url=https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/top-15-nuclear-generating-countries|publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute|accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFossil fuels provide 19% of Canadian electric power, about half as coal (9% of the total) and the remainder a mix of natural gas and oil. Only five provinces use coal for electricity generation. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia rely on coal for nearly half their generation while other provinces and territories use little or none. Alberta and Saskatchewan also use a substantial amount of natural gas. Remote communities including all of Nunavut and much of the Northwest Territories produce most of their electricity from diesel generators, at high economic and environmental cost. The federal government has set up initiatives to reduce dependence on diesel-fired electricity.<ref>{{citation|author=Natural Resources Canada|title=Reducing diesel energy in rural and remote communities|url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/science/programs-funding/20542}}</ref>\n\nNon-hydro renewables are a fast-growing portion of the total, at 7% in 2016.

The vast [[Athabasca oil sands]] give Canada the world's third largest reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela according to [[USGS]]. As such, the oil as gas industry represents 27% of Canada's total [[greenhouse gas emissions]], an increase of 84% since 1990, mostly due to the development of the oil sands.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHistorically, an important issue in Canadian politics is the interplay between the oil and energy industry in [[Western Canada]] and the industrial heartland of Southern Ontario. Foreign investment in Western oil projects has fueled [[Canada]]'s rising dollar. This has raised the price of Ontario's manufacturing exports and made them less competitive, a problem similar to the [[Dutch disease|decline of the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/07/20/growing-equalization-payments-to-ontario-threaten-country-expert/|title=Growing Equalization Payments to Ontario Threaten Country|author=Lee Greenberg|date=2011-07-20|newspaper=National Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Does the Canadian economy suffer from Dutch Disease? |author1=Michel Beine |author2=Charles S.

However, Canada has been a strong supporter of reducing market influencing subsidies through the [[World Trade Organization]]. In 2000, Canada spent approximately CDN$4.6 billion on supports for the industry. Of this, $2.32 billion was classified under the WTO designation of \"green box\" support, meaning it did not directly influence the market, such as money for research or disaster relief. All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for.\n\n==Free-trade agreements==\n{{Main|Free-trade agreements of Canada}}\n[[File:FTAs with Canada.svg|thumb|right|275px|{{Legend|#000|Canada}}{{Legend|#393|Free-trade areas}}]]\n\n===Free-trade agreements in force===\n\n:Source:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*[[Canada\u2013U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 12 October 1987, entered into force 1 January 1989, later superseded by NAFTA)\n*[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1994, includes Canada, U.S. and Mexico)\n*[[Canada\u2013Israel Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1997, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 5 July 1997)\n*[[Canada\u2013Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 November 2002, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013European Free Trade Association Free Trade Agreement]] (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; entered into force 01-Jul-2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Peru Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 August 2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Colombia Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 21 November 2008, entered into force 15 August 2011; Canada's ratification of this FTA had been dependent upon Colombia's ratification of the \"Agreement Concerning Annual Reports on Human Rights and Free Trade Between Canada and the Republic of Colombia\" signed on 27 May 2010)\n*Canada\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement (Signed on 28 June 2009, entered into force 1 October 2012)\n*[[Canada\u2013Panama Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 14 May 2010, entered into force 1 April 2013)\n*[[Canada\u2013South Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 11 March 2014, entered into force 1 January 2015)\n*[[Canada\u2013Ukraine Free Trade Agreement]] (concluded 14 July 2015, entered into force 1 August 2017)\n*[[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (signed 8 March 2018, entered into force 30 December 2018)\n\n===Free-trade agreements concluded===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |access-date=March 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*[[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (concluded 5 October 2015, superseded by CPTPP)\n*[[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (concluded 5 August 2014)\n*[[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement]] (to supersede NAFTA, concluded 30 November 2018)\n\n===Ongoing free-trade agreements negotiations===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\"/>\nCanada is negotiating bilateral FTAs with the following countries respectively trade blocs:\n*Caribbean Community ([[CARICOM]])\n*[[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]]\n*[[Dominican Republic]]\n*[[India]]\n*[[Japan]]<ref>{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2011/02/23/canada-japan-free-trade.html |title=Canada, Japan study free-trade pact|publisher=CBC News |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>\n*[[Morocco]]\n*[[Singapore]]\n*[[Andean Community]] (FTA's are already in force with Peru and Colombia)\n\nCanada has been involved in negotiations to create the following regional trade blocks:\n\n*Canada and Central American Free Trade Agreement\n*[[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA)\n\n==Political issues==\n=== Relations with the U.S. ===\n{{Main|Canada\u2013United States trade relations}}\nCanada and the United States share a common trading relationship.
