When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Media==\n===Manhwa===\nLee Jong-hui launched ''Tower of God'' in Naver's webtoon platform [[Naver Webtoon]] on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"H131017\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Jiseon |date=October 17, 2013 |script-title=ko:0.03%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\u2026\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1\u2019 \uc313\uc740 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \uc190\u2019 |trans-title=0.03% probability, build a \u2018Tower of God\u2019 by \u2018Hand of God\u2019 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/607516.html |language=ko |newspaper=Hani.co.kr |location=Frankfurt |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Its first and second [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]]s was released simultaneously by Young Com on November 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1191157424490549248|user=iyoungcom_2|script-title=ko:\ud83c\udf89\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1, 2\uad8c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd9c\uac04\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\ud83c\udf89  <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> \ucd9c\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\uc704\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!\ud83d\udc95  \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 RT + \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4 \uc911 3\ubd84\uc744 \ucd94\ucca8\ud558\uc5ec <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4~\ud83d\ude0d|language=ko|date=November 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Tower of God'' was the first manhwa and one of the first webtoons to receive official translations by Line Webtoon in 2014, and all unofficial fan translations have since been terminated.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place. A mysterious blonde figure watches the groups filter in and instantly recognizes Khun.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Correct Door\n| TranslitTitle       = Seikai no Tobira\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The Green April\n| TranslitTitle       = Midori no Shigatsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u7dd1\u306e\u56db\u6708\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the manhwa's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, ''Tower of God'' is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.

When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Media==\n===Manhwa===\nLee Jong-hui launched ''Tower of God'' in Naver's webtoon platform [[Naver Webtoon]] on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"H131017\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Jiseon |date=October 17, 2013 |script-title=ko:0.03%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\u2026\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1\u2019 \uc313\uc740 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \uc190\u2019 |trans-title=0.03% probability, build a \u2018Tower of God\u2019 by \u2018Hand of God\u2019 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/607516.html |language=ko |newspaper=Hani.co.kr |location=Frankfurt |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Its first and second [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]]s was released simultaneously by Young Com on November 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1191157424490549248|user=iyoungcom_2|script-title=ko:\ud83c\udf89\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1, 2\uad8c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd9c\uac04\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\ud83c\udf89  <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> \ucd9c\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\uc704\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!\ud83d\udc95  \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 RT + \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4 \uc911 3\ubd84\uc744 \ucd94\ucca8\ud558\uc5ec <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4~\ud83d\ude0d|language=ko|date=November 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Tower of God'' was the first manhwa and one of the first webtoons to receive official translations by Line Webtoon in 2014, and all unofficial fan translations have since been terminated.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place. A mysterious blonde figure watches the groups filter in and instantly recognizes Khun.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Correct Door\n| TranslitTitle       = Seikai no Tobira\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The Green April\n| TranslitTitle       = Midori no Shigatsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u7dd1\u306e\u56db\u6708\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the manhwa's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, ''Tower of God'' is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.

Myerson|Myerson, Roger B.]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&printsec=find&pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&printsec=find&pg=PR7 vii\u2013xi].</ref> It has applications in all fields of [[social science]], as well as in [[logic]], [[systems science]] and [[computer science]]. Originally, it addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [[umbrella term]] for the [[science]] of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\n\nModern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person [[zero-sum game]]s and its proof by [[John von Neumann]]. Von Neumann's original proof used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] on continuous mappings into compact [[convex set]]s, which became a standard method in game theory and [[mathematical economics]]. His paper was followed by the 1944 book ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', co-written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]], which considered [[cooperative game]]s of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nGame theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was explicitly applied to [[biology]] in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. {{As of|2014}}, with the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] going to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]], eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize.

A game is ''non-cooperative'' if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be [[self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] (e.g. through [[credible threat]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/Non-CooperativeGame.html |title=Non-Cooperative Game |last=Shor |first=Mike |website=GameTheory.net |access-date=2016-09-15 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCooperative games are often analyzed through the framework of ''cooperative game theory''''',''' which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take, and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional ''non-cooperative game theory'' which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing [[Nash equilibria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~chandra/documents/6311/coopgames.pdf |title=Cooperative Game Theory |last=Chandrasekaran |first=Ramaswamy |publisher=University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uib.cat/depart/deeweb/pdi/hdeelbm0/arxius_decisions_and_games/cooperative_game_theory-brandenburger.pdf |title=Cooperative Game Theory: Characteristic Functions, Allocations, Marginal Contribution |last=Brandenburger |first=Adam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527184131/http://www.uib.cat/depart/deeweb/pdi/hdeelbm0/arxius_decisions_and_games/cooperative_game_theory-brandenburger.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-27 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it describes only the structure, strategies, and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be too complex to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\n\n===Symmetric / asymmetric===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=An asymmetric game |2L=E |2R=F |1U=E |UL=1, 2 |UR=0, 0 |1D=F |DL=0, 0 |DR=1, 2}}\n{{main|Symmetric game}}\nA symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. That is, if the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2\u00d72 games are symmetric. The standard representations of [[game of chicken|chicken]], the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and the [[stag hunt]] are all symmetric games. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.\n\nMost commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the [[ultimatum game]] and similarly the [[dictator game]] have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.\n\n===Zero-sum / non-zero-sum===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=A zero-sum game |2L=A |2R=B |1U=A |UL=\u20131, 1 |UR=3, \u20133 |1D=B |DL=0, 0 |DR=\u20132, 2}}\n{{main|Zero-sum game}}\nZero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games, the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).<ref>{{cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |authorlink=Guillermo Owen |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-12-531151-9 |location=Bingley |page=11}}</ref> [[Poker]] exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include [[matching pennies]] and most classical board games including [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[chess]].\n\nMany games studied by game theorists (including the famed [[prisoner's dilemma]]) are non-zero-sum games, because the [[Outcome (game theory)|outcome]] has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.\n\nConstant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential [[gains from trade]]. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called \"the board\") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.\n\n===Simultaneous / sequential===\n{{main|Simultaneous game|Sequential game}}\n[[Simultaneous game]]s are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them ''effectively'' simultaneous). [[Sequential game]]s (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be [[perfect information]] about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.\n\nThe difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, [[Normal form game|normal form]] is used to represent simultaneous games, while [[Extensive form game|extensive form]] is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see [[subgame perfection]].\n\nIn short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!

Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and [[Set theory|set theorists]] in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until ''after'' all those moves are completed.\n\nThe focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a [[Determinacy#Basic notions|winning strategy]]. (It can be proven, using the [[axiom of choice]], that there are games{{spaced ndash}}even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are \"win\" or \"lose\"{{spaced ndash}}for which ''neither'' player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in [[descriptive set theory]].\n\n===Discrete and continuous games===\nMuch of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. [[Continuous game]]s allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, [[Cournot competition]] is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.\n\n===Differential games===\n[[Differential game]]s such as the continuous [[Pursuit-evasion|pursuit and evasion game]] are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by [[differential equation]]s. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the [[optimal control]] theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the [[Pontryagin's Minimum Principle|Pontryagin maximum principle]] while the closed-loop strategies are found using [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation|Bellman's Dynamic Programming]] method.\n\nA particular case of differential games are the games with a random [[time horizon]].<ref name=\"PM66\">{{cite journal |language=ru |last1=Petrosjan |first1=L.

Therefore, the players maximize the [[mathematical expectation]] of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.\n\n===Evolutionary game theory===\n[[Evolutionary game theory]] studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.<ref name=Newton2018renaissance>{{cite journal | last1=Newton | first1=Jonathan | year=2018 | title=Evolutionary Game Theory: A Renaissance | journal=Games | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=31 | doi=10.3390/g9020031}}</ref>  In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a [[Markov chain]] with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization, or survival of the fittest.\n\nIn biology, such models can represent (biological) [[evolution]], in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.{{sfnp|Webb|2007}}\n\n===Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields)===\nIndividual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered \"one-player games\". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.{{By whom|date=March 2011}} They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of [[decision theory]], [[operations research]], and areas of [[artificial intelligence]], particularly [[AI planning]] (with uncertainty) and [[multi-agent system]]. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using [[Markov decision process]]es (MDP).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lozovanu |first1=D |last2=Pickl |first2=S |title=A Game-Theoretical Approach to Markov Decision Processes, Stochastic Positional Games and Multicriteria Control Models |date=2015 |publisher=Springer, Cham |isbn=978-3-319-11832-1 }}</ref>\n\nStochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes \"chance moves\" (\"[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]\").{{sfnp|Osborne|Rubinstein|1994}} This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.\n\nFor some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the [[Minimax|minimax solution]] is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.<ref name=\"McMahan\">{{cite journal |first=Hugh Brendan |last=McMahan |date=2006 |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mcmahan/research/mcmahan_thesis.pdf |title=Robust Planning in Domains with Stochastic Outcomes, Adversaries, and Partial Observability |journal=CMU-CS-06-166 |pages=3\u20134}}</ref> (See [[Black swan theory]] for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)\n\nGeneral models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The \"[[gold standard]]\" is considered to be partially observable [[stochastic game]] (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.<ref name=\"McMahan\" />\n\n===Metagames===\nThese are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. [[Metagame]]s seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to [[mechanism design]] theory.\n\nThe term [[metagame analysis]] is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.{{sfnp|Howard|1971}} whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realize their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of [[confrontation analysis]].\n\n===Pooling games===\nThese are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path, and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wenliang |last=Wang |date=2015 |title=Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan |isbn=978-1507658246}}</ref>\n\n===Mean field game theory===\n[[Mean field game theory]] is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by [[Boyan Jovanovic]] and [[Robert W. Rosenthal]], in the engineering literature by [[Peter E. Caines]], and by mathematician [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] and Jean-Michel Lasry.\n\n==Representation of games==\n\nThe games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the [[Player (game)|''players'' of the game]], the ''information'' and ''actions'' available to each player at each decision point, and the [[Utility|''payoffs'']] for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four \"essential elements\" by the acronym \"PAPI\".)<ref name=\"r7a\"/><ref name=\"r7b\"/><ref name=\"r7c\"/><ref name=\"r7d\"/> A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a [[solution concept]] of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] to the game\u2014a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.\n\nMost cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.\n\n===Extensive form===\n{{main|Extensive form game}}\n[[File:Ultimatum Game Extensive Form.svg|thumb|left|An extensive form game]]\nThe extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] (as pictured here). Here each [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|vertex]] (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a [[decision tree]].{{sfnp|Fudenberg|Tirole|1991|p=67}} To solve any extensive form game, [[backward induction]] must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Security Studies: an Introduction |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |pages=55\u201356 |edition=second}}</ref>\n\nThe game pictured consists of two players.  The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), ''Player 1'' \"moves\" first by choosing either {{var|F}} or {{var|U}} (fair or unfair). Next in the sequence, ''Player 2'', who has now seen ''Player 1''{{'}}s move, chooses to play either {{var|A}} or {{var|R}}. Once ''Player 2'' has made their choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff.  Suppose that ''Player 1'' chooses {{var|U}} and then ''Player 2'' chooses {{var|A}}: ''Player 1'' then gets a payoff of \"eight\" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and ''Player 2'' gets a payoff of \"two\".\n\nThe extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the [[#Perfect information and imperfect information|imperfect information section]].)\n\n===Normal form===\n<!----- {| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A normal form game''\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 2 chooses left''\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 2 chooses right''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #009;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 1 chooses top''\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">4</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">3</span>\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">-1</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">-1</span>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #009;width: 100px;\" | ''Player 1 chooses bottom''\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">0</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">0</span>\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">3</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">4</span>\n|} ----->\n{{Payoff matrix |Float=right |Width=330\n| Name = Normal form or payoff matrix of a 2-player, 2-strategy game\n| 2L = {{color|#900|Player 2<br />chooses ''Left''}}\n| 2R = {{color|#900|Player 2<br />chooses ''Right''}}\n| 1U = {{color|#009|Player 1<br />chooses ''Up''}}\n| 1D = {{color|#009|Player 1<br />chooses&nbsp;''Down''}}\n| UL = {{color|#009|'''4'''}}, {{color|#900|'''3'''}}\n| UR = {{color|#009|'''\u20131'''}}, {{color|#900|'''\u20131'''}}\n| DL = {{color|#009|'''0'''}}, {{color|#900|'''0'''}}\n| DR = {{color|#009|'''3'''}}, {{color|#900|'''4'''}}\n}}\n{{main|Normal-form game}}\nThe normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays ''Up'' and that Player 2 plays ''Left''. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.\n\nWhen a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.\n\nEvery extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=35}}\n\n===Characteristic function form===\n{{main|Cooperative game}}\nIn games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.\n\nThe origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> appears, it works against the fraction\n<math>\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{N}}{\\mathbf{C}}\\right)\n</math>\nas if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.\n\nFormally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and <math>v:2^N \\to \\mathbf{R}</math> is a normal utility.\n\nSuch characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.\n\n===Alternative game representations===\n{{see also|Succinct game}}\n\nAlternative game representation forms exist and are used for some subclasses of games or adjusted to the needs of interdisciplinary research.<ref>{{cite arxiv |last1=Tagiew |first1=Rustam |title=If more than Analytical Modeling is Needed to Predict Real Agents' Strategic Interaction

It was initially developed in [[economics]] to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1838 with his solution of the [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.\n\nAlthough pre-twentieth century [[Natural history|naturalists]] such as [[Charles Darwin]] made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name \"game theory\", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by [[John Maynard Smith]] in his book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Daniel |date=1998 |title=On economic applications of evolutionary game theory |url=https://leeps.ucsc.edu/media/papers/EconAppEvolGameTheory3-1-98.pdf |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=8 |pages=14-53}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to [[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescribe]] such behavior.<ref name=\"Camerer2003\">{{cite book |authorlink=Colin F.

This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in [[physics]]. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific [[Idealization (science philosophy)|ideal]] akin to the models used by [[physicist]]s. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the [[centipede game]], [[guess 2/3 of the average|guess {{frac|2|3}} of the average]] game, and the [[dictator game]], people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.{{efn|Experimental work in game theory goes by many names, [[experimental economics]], [[behavioral economics]], and [[behavioural game theory]] are several.<ref>{{cite book |first=Colin F. |last=Camerer |date=2003 |title=Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html |chapter=Introduction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201411/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |pages=1\u201325 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nSome game theorists, following the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], have turned to [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or [[bounded rationality]] on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume [[natural selection]] in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, [[fictitious play]] dynamics).\n\n===Prescriptive or normative analysis===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] | 2L=Cooperate |2R=Defect |1U=Cooperate |UL=-1, -1 |UR=-10, 0 |1D=Defect |DL=0, -10 |DR=-5, -5}}\nSome scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a [[Nash equilibrium]] of a game constitutes one's [[best response]] to the actions of the other players \u2013 provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium \u2013 playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{Anchor|Economics}}\n\n===Economics and business===\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.<ref name=\"GT-F-R-09\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |title=Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |archivedate=24 May 2013 |publisher=[[INSEAD]] |first=Markus |last=Christen |date=1 July 1998 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all |journal= |access-date=1 July 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"GT-F-R-10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |url-status=dead |title=Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |website=The European Financial Review |date=15 February 2012 |access-date=2013-01-03 |first1=Beno\u00eet |last1=Chevalier-Roignant |first2=Lenos |last2=Trigeorgis |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the [[utility]] of individual players.\n\nA prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): ''descriptive'' and ''[[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescriptive]]''.<ref name=\"Camerer2003\" />\n\n===Project management===\n\nSensible decision-making is critical for the success of projects.  In project management, game theory is used to model the decision-making process of players, such as investors, project managers, contractors, sub-contractors, governments and customers.  Quite often, these players have competing interests, and sometimes their interests are directly detrimental to other players, making project management scenarios well-suited to be modeled by game theory.\n\nPiraveenan (2019)<ref name=\"Piraveenan 2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Piraveenan |first1=Mahendra |title=Applications of Game Theory in Project Management: A Structured Review and Analysis |journal=Mathematics |date=2019 |volume=7 |issue=9 |page=858 |doi=10.3390/math7090858}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref> in his review provides several examples where game theory is used to model project management scenarios. For instance, an investor typically has several investment options, and each option will likely result in a different project, and thus one of the investment options has to be chosen before the project charter can be produced. Similarly, any large project involving subcontractors, for instance, a construction project, has a complex interplay between the main contractor (the project manager) and subcontractors, or among the subcontractors themselves, which typically has several decision points. For example, if there is an ambiguity in the contract between the contractor and subcontractor, each must decide how hard to push their case without jeopardizing the whole project, and thus their own stake in it. Similarly, when projects from competing organizations are launched, the marketing personnel have to decide what is the best timing and strategy to market the project, or its resultant product or service, so that it can gain maximum traction in the face of competition. In each of these scenarios, the required decisions depend on the decisions of other players who, in some way, have competing interests to the interests of the decision-maker, and thus can ideally be modeled using game theory.\n\nPiraveenan <ref name=\"Piraveenan 2019\" /> summarises that two-player games are predominantly used to model project management scenarios, and based on the identity of these players, five distinct types of games are used in project management.\n\n# Government-sector\u2013private-sector games (games that model [[public\u2013private partnership]]s)\n# Contractor\u2013contractor games\n# Contractor\u2013subcontractor games\n# Subcontractor\u2013subcontractor games\n# Games involving other players\n\nIn terms of types of games, both cooperative as well as non-cooperative games, normal-form as well as extensive-form games, and zero-sum as well as non-zero-sum games are used to model various project management scenarios.\n\n===Political science===\nThe application of game theory to [[political science]] is focused in the overlapping areas of [[fair division]], [[political economy]], [[public choice]], [[war's inefficiency puzzle|war bargaining]], [[positive political theory]], and [[social choice theory]]. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.\n\nEarly examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by [[Anthony Downs]]. In his book ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|1957}}</ref> he applies the [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling firm location model]] to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the [[Cuban missile crisis]] during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steven J. |last=Brams |authorlink=Steven Brams |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/game-theory-and-cuban-missile-crisis |title=Game theory and the Cuban missile crisis |website=Plus Magazine |date=1 January 2001 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government.  Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects.  Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed.  Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime.  Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2371076 |title=Yes, Law is the Command of the Sovereign |year=2013 |last1=Morrison |first1=Andrew Stumpff |journal=[[Social Science Research Network|SSRN]] |date=January 2013}}</ref>\n\nA game-theoretic explanation for [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1162/154247604323015463 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/539/ |jstor=40004867 |title=It Takes Two: An Explanation for the Democratic Peace |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201329 |year=2004 |last1=Levy |first1=G. |last2=Razin |first2=R.}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fearon |first=James D. |date=1 January 1995 |title=Rationalist Explanations for War |journal=International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379\u2013414 |doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324 |jstor=2706903 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nGame theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a [[prisoner's dilemma]] to the nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Peter John |year=2011 |title=Climate change and game theory |url= https://crawford.anu.edu.au/research_units/eerh/pdf/EERH_RR62.pdf |journal=Ecological Economics Review |volume=1219 |issue= 1|pages=153\u201370 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05891.x|pmid=21332497 |hdl=1885/67270|bibcode=2011NYASA1219..153W}}<!--https://crawford.anu.edu.au/research_units/eerh/pdf/EERH_RR62.pdf--></ref>\n\n===Biology===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Chicken (game)#Hawk-Dove|hawk-dove]] game |2L=Hawk |2R=Dove |1U=Hawk |UL=20, 20 |UR=80, 40 |1D=Dove |DL=40, 80 |DR=60, 60}}\n{{main|Evolutionary game theory}}\n\nUnlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in [[biology]] are often interpreted as corresponding to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. In addition, the focus has been less on [[solution concept|equilibria]] that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by [[evolution]]ary forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the ''[[evolutionarily stable strategy]]'' (ESS), first introduced in {{harv|Smith|Price|1973}}. Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the [[Nash equilibrium]], every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 [[sex ratio]]s. {{harv|Fisher|1930}} suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.\n\nAdditionally, biologists have used [[evolutionary game theory]] and the ESS to explain the emergence of [[animal communication]].{{sfnp|Harper|Maynard Smith|2003}} The analysis of [[signaling games]] and [[Cheap talk|other communication games]] has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the [[mobbing behavior]] of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see [[Paul Ormerod]]'s ''[[Butterfly Economics]]'').\n\nBiologists have used the [[Chicken (game)|game of chicken]] to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Maynard Smith |first1=John |authorlink=John Maynard Smith |title=The theory of games and the evolution of animal conflicts |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013221 |year=1974 |pmid=4459582 |url=http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4448.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maynard Smith, in the preface to ''Evolution and the Theory of Games'', \"paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed\". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.<ref name=\"stan-egt\">{{cite web |editorlink=Edward N.

McKenzie |last=Alexander}}</ref>\n\nOne such phenomenon is known as [[Altruism in animals|biological altruism]]. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to [[vervet monkey]]s that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.<ref name=\"qudzyh\">{{cite web |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/ |title=Biological Altruism |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=3 June 2003 |access-date=3 January 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |df=mdy-all |editorlink=Edward N. Zalta |first=Samir |last=Okasha}}</ref> All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.\n\nEvolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of [[kin selection]]. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. [[Hamilton's rule]] explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation {{Math|c < b &times; r}}, where the cost {{varserif|c}} to the altruist must be less than the benefit {{varserif|b}} to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness {{varserif|r}}. The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of {{frac|1|2}}, because (on average) an individual shares half of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.<ref name=\"qudzyh\" /> The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was {{frac|1|2}} in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.\n\n===Computer science and logic===\nGame theory has come to play an increasingly important role in [[logic]] and in [[computer science]]. Several logical theories have a basis in [[game semantics]]. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model [[interactive computation]]s.

Responding to two papers by {{harvard citations|txt=yes|first=W.V.O.|last=Quine|author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|year=1960|year2=1967}}, {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} used game theory to develop a philosophical account of [[Convention (norm)|convention]]. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] and employed it in analyzing play in [[coordination game]]s. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] in terms of [[signaling games]]. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Skyrms|1996}}</ref><ref>{{harvard citations |txt=yes |last1=Grim |last2=Kokalis |last3=Alai-Tafti |last4=Kilb |last5=St Denis |year=2004}}).</ref> Following {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and [[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri]] (2006) have developed theories of [[social norms]] that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.<ref>{{citation |first=E. |last=Ullmann-Margalit |title=The Emergence of Norms |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0198244110 |url=https://archive.org/details/emergenceofnorms0024ullm }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Cristina |last=Bicchieri |authorlink=Cristina Bicchieri |title=The Grammar of Society: the Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0521573726}}</ref>\n\nGame theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive [[epistemology]]: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),<ref>{{citation |title=Self-Refuting Theories of Strategic Interaction: A Paradox of Common Knowledge |journal=Erkenntnis |volume=30 |issue=1\u20132 |year=1989 |pages=69\u201385 |doi=10.1007/BF00184816 |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |authorlink=Cristina Bicchieri}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |author1-link=Cristina Bicchieri |title=Rationality and Coordination |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-57444-0 |year=1993}}</ref> [[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms]] (1990),<ref>{{citation |first=Brian |last=Skyrms |authorlink=Brian Skyrms |title=The Dynamics of Rational Deliberation |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0674218857}}</ref> and [[Robert Stalnaker|Stalnaker]] (1999).<ref>{{citation |chapter=Knowledge, Belief, and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games |editor-first=Cristina |editor-last=Bicchieri |editor-link1=Cristina Bicchieri |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Jeffrey |editor3-first=Brian |editor3-last=Skyrms |title=The Logic of Strategy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0195117158}}</ref>\n\nIn [[ethics]], some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) {{Who|date=July 2012}} authors have attempted to pursue [[Thomas Hobbes]]' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the [[prisoner's dilemma]] present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general [[social contract]] view in [[political philosophy]] (for examples, see {{Harvtxt|Gauthier|1986}} and {{Harvtxt|Kavka |1986}}).{{efn|For a more detailed discussion of the use of game theory in ethics, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/ game theory and ethics].}}\n\nOther authors have attempted to use [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, [[stag hunt]], and the [[Nash bargaining game]] as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last=Skyrms|year=1996|year2=2004}} and {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last1=Sober|last2=Wilson|year=1999}}).\n\n=== Retail and consumer product pricing ===\nGame theory applications are used heavily in the pricing strategies of retail and consumer markets, particularly for the sale of [[inelastic good]]s. With retailers constantly competing against one another for consumer market share, it has become a fairly common practice for retailers to discount certain goods, intermittently, in the hopes of increasing foot-traffic in [[brick and mortar]] locations (websites visits for [[e-commerce]] retailers) or increasing sales of ancillary or complimentary products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/robert.shumsky/GameTheoryModels.pdf|title=Game Theory Models of Pricing|last=Kopalle|last2=Shumsky|url-status=live|access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], a popular shopping holiday in the US, is when many retailers focus on optimal pricing strategies to capture the holiday shopping market. In the Black Friday scenario, retailers using game theory applications typically ask \u201cwhat is the dominant competitor\u2019s reaction to me?\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2017/09/18/how-e-commerce-uses-game-theory-to-capture-consumer-dollars/|title=How e-Commerce Uses Game Theory to Capture Consumer Dollars : Networks Course blog for INFO 2040/CS 2850/Econ 2040/SOC 2090|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> In such a scenario, the game has two players: the retailer, and the consumer. The retailer is focused on an optimal pricing strategy, while the consumer is focused on the best deal. In this closed system, there often is no dominant strategy as both players have alternative options. That is, retailers can find a different customer, and consumers can shop at a different retailer.<ref name=\":0\" /> Given the market competition that day, however, the dominant strategy for retailers lies in outperforming competitors. The open system assumes multiple retailers selling similar goods, and a finite number of consumers demanding the goods at an optimal price. A blog by a [[Cornell University]] professor provided an example of such a strategy, when [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] priced a Samsung TV $100 below retail value, effectively undercutting competitors. Amazon made up part of the difference by increasing the price of HDMI cables, as it has been found that consumers are less price discriminatory when it comes to the sale of secondary items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRetail markets continue to evolve strategies and applications of game theory when it comes to pricing consumer goods. The key insights found between simulations in a controlled environment and real-world retail experiences show that the applications of such strategies are more complex, as each retailer has to find an optimal balance between [[Pricing strategies|pricing]], [[Supplier relationship management|supplier relations]], [[brand image]], and the potential to [[Cannibalization (marketing)|cannibalize]] the sale of more profitable items.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://sfkcorp.com/2018/11/27/black-friday-games-concurrent-pricing-wars-for-a-competitive-advantage/|title=Black Friday Games: Concurrent pricing wars for a competitive advantage.|date=2018-11-27|website=SFK Inc. {{!}} SKK Marine {{!}} SFK SecCon|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Based on [[A Beautiful Mind (book)|the 1998 book]] by [[Sylvia Nasar]],<ref>Nasar, Sylvia (1998) ''A Beautiful Mind'', Simon & Schuster. {{isbn|0-684-81906-6}}.</ref> the life story of game theorist and mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] was turned into the 2001 [[biopic]] ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', starring [[Russell Crowe]] as Nash.<ref>Singh, Simon (14 June 1998)  [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/14/reviews/980614.14singht.html \"Between Genius and Madness\"], New York Times.</ref>\n* The 1959 [[military science fiction]] novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' by [[Robert A.

Originally, it addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [[umbrella term]] for the [[science]] of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\n\nModern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person [[zero-sum game]]s and its proof by [[John von Neumann]]. Von Neumann's original proof used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] on continuous mappings into compact [[convex set]]s, which became a standard method in game theory and [[mathematical economics]]. His paper was followed by the 1944 book ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', co-written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]], which considered [[cooperative game]]s of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nGame theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was explicitly applied to [[biology]] in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. {{As of|2014}}, with the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] going to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]], eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. [[John Maynard Smith]] was awarded the [[Crafoord Prize]] for his application of game theory to biology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|[[John von Neumann]]]]\n[[File:John f nash 20061102 3.jpg|thumb|[[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]]]]\n\nDiscussions of two-person games began long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory.\nThe first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter believed to be written in 1713 by Charles Waldegrave, an active [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] and uncle to [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave|James Waldegrave]], a British diplomat.<ref name=\"GT-PD-01\">{{citation |url=http://www.jehps.net/Decembre2007/Bellhouse.pdf |title=The Problem of Waldegrave |author=Bellhouse, David R. |journal=Journal \u00c9lectronique d'Histoire des Probabilit\u00e9s et de la Statistique |trans-work=Electronic Journal of Probability History and Statistics |year=2007 |volume=3 |issue=2}}</ref> The true identity of the original correspondent is somewhat elusive given the limited details and evidence available and the subjective nature of its interpretation.

Nash proved that every finite n-player, non-zero-sum (not just two-player zero-sum) [[non-cooperative game]] has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\nGame theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which the concepts of the [[core (economics)|core]], the [[extensive form game]], [[fictitious play]], [[repeated game]]s, and the [[Shapley value]] were developed. The 1950s also saw the first applications of game theory to [[philosophy]] and [[political science]].\n\nIn 1979 [[Robert Axelrod]] tried setting up computer programs as players and found that in tournaments between them the winner was often a simple \"tit-for-tat\" program that cooperates on the first step, then, on subsequent steps, does whatever its opponent did on the previous step.

In addition, the concepts of [[correlated equilibrium]], trembling hand perfection, and [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]{{efn|Although common knowledge was first discussed by the philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] in his dissertation (and later book) ''Convention'' in the late 1960s, it was not widely considered by economists until [[Robert Aumann]]'s work in the 1970s.}} were introduced and analyzed.\n\nIn 2005, game theorists [[Thomas Schelling]] and [[Robert Aumann]] followed Nash, Selten, and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of [[evolutionary game theory]]. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing equilibrium coarsening and correlated equilibria, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.\n\nIn 2007, [[Leonid Hurwicz]], [[Eric Maskin]], and [[Roger Myerson]] were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \"for having laid the foundations of [[mechanism design]] theory\".

As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be too complex to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\n\n===Symmetric / asymmetric===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=An asymmetric game |2L=E |2R=F |1U=E |UL=1, 2 |UR=0, 0 |1D=F |DL=0, 0 |DR=1, 2}}\n{{main|Symmetric game}}\nA symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. That is, if the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2\u00d72 games are symmetric. The standard representations of [[game of chicken|chicken]], the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and the [[stag hunt]] are all symmetric games. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.\n\nMost commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the [[ultimatum game]] and similarly the [[dictator game]] have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.\n\n===Zero-sum / non-zero-sum===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=A zero-sum game |2L=A |2R=B |1U=A |UL=\u20131, 1 |UR=3, \u20133 |1D=B |DL=0, 0 |DR=\u20132, 2}}\n{{main|Zero-sum game}}\nZero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games, the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).<ref>{{cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |authorlink=Guillermo Owen |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-12-531151-9 |location=Bingley |page=11}}</ref> [[Poker]] exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include [[matching pennies]] and most classical board games including [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[chess]].\n\nMany games studied by game theorists (including the famed [[prisoner's dilemma]]) are non-zero-sum games, because the [[Outcome (game theory)|outcome]] has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.\n\nConstant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential [[gains from trade]]. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called \"the board\") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.\n\n===Simultaneous / sequential===\n{{main|Simultaneous game|Sequential game}}\n[[Simultaneous game]]s are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them ''effectively'' simultaneous). [[Sequential game]]s (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be [[perfect information]] about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.\n\nThe difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, [[Normal form game|normal form]] is used to represent simultaneous games, while [[Extensive form game|extensive form]] is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see [[subgame perfection]].\n\nIn short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!

Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and [[Set theory|set theorists]] in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until ''after'' all those moves are completed.\n\nThe focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a [[Determinacy#Basic notions|winning strategy]]. (It can be proven, using the [[axiom of choice]], that there are games{{spaced ndash}}even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are \"win\" or \"lose\"{{spaced ndash}}for which ''neither'' player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in [[descriptive set theory]].\n\n===Discrete and continuous games===\nMuch of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. [[Continuous game]]s allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, [[Cournot competition]] is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.\n\n===Differential games===\n[[Differential game]]s such as the continuous [[Pursuit-evasion|pursuit and evasion game]] are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by [[differential equation]]s. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the [[optimal control]] theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the [[Pontryagin's Minimum Principle|Pontryagin maximum principle]] while the closed-loop strategies are found using [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation|Bellman's Dynamic Programming]] method.\n\nA particular case of differential games are the games with a random [[time horizon]].<ref name=\"PM66\">{{cite journal |language=ru |last1=Petrosjan |first1=L.

Sb. |volume=6 |pages=423\u2013433}}</ref> In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given [[probability distribution]] function. Therefore, the players maximize the [[mathematical expectation]] of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.\n\n===Evolutionary game theory===\n[[Evolutionary game theory]] studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.<ref name=Newton2018renaissance>{{cite journal | last1=Newton | first1=Jonathan | year=2018 | title=Evolutionary Game Theory: A Renaissance | journal=Games | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=31 | doi=10.3390/g9020031}}</ref>  In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a [[Markov chain]] with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization, or survival of the fittest.\n\nIn biology, such models can represent (biological) [[evolution]], in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.{{sfnp|Webb|2007}}\n\n===Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields)===\nIndividual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered \"one-player games\". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.{{By whom|date=March 2011}} They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of [[decision theory]], [[operations research]], and areas of [[artificial intelligence]], particularly [[AI planning]] (with uncertainty) and [[multi-agent system]]. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using [[Markov decision process]]es (MDP).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lozovanu |first1=D |last2=Pickl |first2=S |title=A Game-Theoretical Approach to Markov Decision Processes, Stochastic Positional Games and Multicriteria Control Models |date=2015 |publisher=Springer, Cham |isbn=978-3-319-11832-1 }}</ref>\n\nStochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes \"chance moves\" (\"[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]\").{{sfnp|Osborne|Rubinstein|1994}} This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.\n\nFor some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the [[Minimax|minimax solution]] is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.<ref name=\"McMahan\">{{cite journal |first=Hugh Brendan |last=McMahan |date=2006 |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mcmahan/research/mcmahan_thesis.pdf |title=Robust Planning in Domains with Stochastic Outcomes, Adversaries, and Partial Observability |journal=CMU-CS-06-166 |pages=3\u20134}}</ref> (See [[Black swan theory]] for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)\n\nGeneral models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The \"[[gold standard]]\" is considered to be partially observable [[stochastic game]] (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.<ref name=\"McMahan\" />\n\n===Metagames===\nThese are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. [[Metagame]]s seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to [[mechanism design]] theory.\n\nThe term [[metagame analysis]] is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.{{sfnp|Howard|1971}} whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realize their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of [[confrontation analysis]].\n\n===Pooling games===\nThese are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path, and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wenliang |last=Wang |date=2015 |title=Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan |isbn=978-1507658246}}</ref>\n\n===Mean field game theory===\n[[Mean field game theory]] is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by [[Boyan Jovanovic]] and [[Robert W. Rosenthal]], in the engineering literature by [[Peter E. Caines]], and by mathematician [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] and Jean-Michel Lasry.\n\n==Representation of games==\n\nThe games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the [[Player (game)|''players'' of the game]], the ''information'' and ''actions'' available to each player at each decision point, and the [[Utility|''payoffs'']] for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four \"essential elements\" by the acronym \"PAPI\".)<ref name=\"r7a\"/><ref name=\"r7b\"/><ref name=\"r7c\"/><ref name=\"r7d\"/> A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a [[solution concept]] of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] to the game\u2014a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.\n\nMost cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.\n\n===Extensive form===\n{{main|Extensive form game}}\n[[File:Ultimatum Game Extensive Form.svg|thumb|left|An extensive form game]]\nThe extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] (as pictured here). Here each [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|vertex]] (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a [[decision tree]].{{sfnp|Fudenberg|Tirole|1991|p=67}} To solve any extensive form game, [[backward induction]] must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Security Studies: an Introduction |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |pages=55\u201356 |edition=second}}</ref>\n\nThe game pictured consists of two players.  The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), ''Player 1'' \"moves\" first by choosing either {{var|F}} or {{var|U}} (fair or unfair). Next in the sequence, ''Player 2'', who has now seen ''Player 1''{{'}}s move, chooses to play either {{var|A}} or {{var|R}}. Once ''Player 2'' has made their choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff.  Suppose that ''Player 1'' chooses {{var|U}} and then ''Player 2'' chooses {{var|A}}: ''Player 1'' then gets a payoff of \"eight\" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and ''Player 2'' gets a payoff of \"two\".\n\nThe extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the [[#Perfect information and imperfect information|imperfect information section]].)\n\n===Normal form===\n<!----- {| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A normal form game''\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 2 chooses left''\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 2 chooses right''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #009;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 1 chooses top''\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">4</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">3</span>\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">-1</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">-1</span>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #009;width: 100px;\" | ''Player 1 chooses bottom''\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">0</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">0</span>\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">3</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">4</span>\n|} ----->\n{{Payoff matrix |Float=right |Width=330\n| Name = Normal form or payoff matrix of a 2-player, 2-strategy game\n| 2L = {{color|#900|Player 2<br />chooses ''Left''}}\n| 2R = {{color|#900|Player 2<br />chooses ''Right''}}\n| 1U = {{color|#009|Player 1<br />chooses ''Up''}}\n| 1D = {{color|#009|Player 1<br />chooses&nbsp;''Down''}}\n| UL = {{color|#009|'''4'''}}, {{color|#900|'''3'''}}\n| UR = {{color|#009|'''\u20131'''}}, {{color|#900|'''\u20131'''}}\n| DL = {{color|#009|'''0'''}}, {{color|#900|'''0'''}}\n| DR = {{color|#009|'''3'''}}, {{color|#900|'''4'''}}\n}}\n{{main|Normal-form game}}\nThe normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays ''Up'' and that Player 2 plays ''Left''. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.\n\nWhen a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.\n\nEvery extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=35}}\n\n===Characteristic function form===\n{{main|Cooperative game}}\nIn games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.\n\nThe origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> appears, it works against the fraction\n<math>\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{N}}{\\mathbf{C}}\\right)\n</math>\nas if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.\n\nFormally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and <math>v:2^N \\to \\mathbf{R}</math> is a normal utility.\n\nSuch characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.\n\n===Alternative game representations===\n{{see also|Succinct game}}\n\nAlternative game representation forms exist and are used for some subclasses of games or adjusted to the needs of interdisciplinary research.<ref>{{cite arxiv |last1=Tagiew |first1=Rustam |title=If more than Analytical Modeling is Needed to Predict Real Agents' Strategic Interaction

It was initially developed in [[economics]] to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1838 with his solution of the [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.\n\nAlthough pre-twentieth century [[Natural history|naturalists]] such as [[Charles Darwin]] made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name \"game theory\", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by [[John Maynard Smith]] in his book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Daniel |date=1998 |title=On economic applications of evolutionary game theory |url=https://leeps.ucsc.edu/media/papers/EconAppEvolGameTheory3-1-98.pdf |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=8 |pages=14-53}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to [[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescribe]] such behavior.<ref name=\"Camerer2003\">{{cite book |authorlink=Colin F.

This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in [[physics]]. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific [[Idealization (science philosophy)|ideal]] akin to the models used by [[physicist]]s. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the [[centipede game]], [[guess 2/3 of the average|guess {{frac|2|3}} of the average]] game, and the [[dictator game]], people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.{{efn|Experimental work in game theory goes by many names, [[experimental economics]], [[behavioral economics]], and [[behavioural game theory]] are several.<ref>{{cite book |first=Colin F. |last=Camerer |date=2003 |title=Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html |chapter=Introduction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201411/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |pages=1\u201325 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nSome game theorists, following the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], have turned to [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or [[bounded rationality]] on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume [[natural selection]] in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, [[fictitious play]] dynamics).\n\n===Prescriptive or normative analysis===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] | 2L=Cooperate |2R=Defect |1U=Cooperate |UL=-1, -1 |UR=-10, 0 |1D=Defect |DL=0, -10 |DR=-5, -5}}\nSome scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a [[Nash equilibrium]] of a game constitutes one's [[best response]] to the actions of the other players \u2013 provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium \u2013 playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{Anchor|Economics}}\n\n===Economics and business===\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.<ref name=\"GT-F-R-09\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |title=Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |archivedate=24 May 2013 |publisher=[[INSEAD]] |first=Markus |last=Christen |date=1 July 1998 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all |journal= |access-date=1 July 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"GT-F-R-10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |url-status=dead |title=Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |website=The European Financial Review |date=15 February 2012 |access-date=2013-01-03 |first1=Beno\u00eet |last1=Chevalier-Roignant |first2=Lenos |last2=Trigeorgis |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the [[utility]] of individual players.\n\nA prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): ''descriptive'' and ''[[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescriptive]]''.<ref name=\"Camerer2003\" />\n\n===Project management===\n\nSensible decision-making is critical for the success of projects.  In project management, game theory is used to model the decision-making process of players, such as investors, project managers, contractors, sub-contractors, governments and customers.  Quite often, these players have competing interests, and sometimes their interests are directly detrimental to other players, making project management scenarios well-suited to be modeled by game theory.\n\nPiraveenan (2019)<ref name=\"Piraveenan 2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Piraveenan |first1=Mahendra |title=Applications of Game Theory in Project Management: A Structured Review and Analysis |journal=Mathematics |date=2019 |volume=7 |issue=9 |page=858 |doi=10.3390/math7090858}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref> in his review provides several examples where game theory is used to model project management scenarios. For instance, an investor typically has several investment options, and each option will likely result in a different project, and thus one of the investment options has to be chosen before the project charter can be produced. Similarly, any large project involving subcontractors, for instance, a construction project, has a complex interplay between the main contractor (the project manager) and subcontractors, or among the subcontractors themselves, which typically has several decision points. For example, if there is an ambiguity in the contract between the contractor and subcontractor, each must decide how hard to push their case without jeopardizing the whole project, and thus their own stake in it. Similarly, when projects from competing organizations are launched, the marketing personnel have to decide what is the best timing and strategy to market the project, or its resultant product or service, so that it can gain maximum traction in the face of competition. In each of these scenarios, the required decisions depend on the decisions of other players who, in some way, have competing interests to the interests of the decision-maker, and thus can ideally be modeled using game theory.\n\nPiraveenan <ref name=\"Piraveenan 2019\" /> summarises that two-player games are predominantly used to model project management scenarios, and based on the identity of these players, five distinct types of games are used in project management.\n\n# Government-sector\u2013private-sector games (games that model [[public\u2013private partnership]]s)\n# Contractor\u2013contractor games\n# Contractor\u2013subcontractor games\n# Subcontractor\u2013subcontractor games\n# Games involving other players\n\nIn terms of types of games, both cooperative as well as non-cooperative games, normal-form as well as extensive-form games, and zero-sum as well as non-zero-sum games are used to model various project management scenarios.\n\n===Political science===\nThe application of game theory to [[political science]] is focused in the overlapping areas of [[fair division]], [[political economy]], [[public choice]], [[war's inefficiency puzzle|war bargaining]], [[positive political theory]], and [[social choice theory]]. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.\n\nEarly examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by [[Anthony Downs]]. In his book ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|1957}}</ref> he applies the [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling firm location model]] to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the [[Cuban missile crisis]] during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steven J. |last=Brams |authorlink=Steven Brams |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/game-theory-and-cuban-missile-crisis |title=Game theory and the Cuban missile crisis |website=Plus Magazine |date=1 January 2001 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government.  Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects.  Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed.  Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime.  Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2371076 |title=Yes, Law is the Command of the Sovereign |year=2013 |last1=Morrison |first1=Andrew Stumpff |journal=[[Social Science Research Network|SSRN]] |date=January 2013}}</ref>\n\nA game-theoretic explanation for [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1162/154247604323015463 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/539/ |jstor=40004867 |title=It Takes Two: An Explanation for the Democratic Peace |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201329 |year=2004 |last1=Levy |first1=G. |last2=Razin |first2=R.}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fearon |first=James D. |date=1 January 1995 |title=Rationalist Explanations for War |journal=International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379\u2013414 |doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324 |jstor=2706903 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nGame theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a [[prisoner's dilemma]] to the nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Peter John |year=2011 |title=Climate change and game theory |url= https://crawford.anu.edu.au/research_units/eerh/pdf/EERH_RR62.pdf |journal=Ecological Economics Review |volume=1219 |issue= 1|pages=153\u201370 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05891.x|pmid=21332497 |hdl=1885/67270|bibcode=2011NYASA1219..153W}}<!--https://crawford.anu.edu.au/research_units/eerh/pdf/EERH_RR62.pdf--></ref>\n\n===Biology===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Chicken (game)#Hawk-Dove|hawk-dove]] game |2L=Hawk |2R=Dove |1U=Hawk |UL=20, 20 |UR=80, 40 |1D=Dove |DL=40, 80 |DR=60, 60}}\n{{main|Evolutionary game theory}}\n\nUnlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in [[biology]] are often interpreted as corresponding to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. In addition, the focus has been less on [[solution concept|equilibria]] that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by [[evolution]]ary forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the ''[[evolutionarily stable strategy]]'' (ESS), first introduced in {{harv|Smith|Price|1973}}. Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the [[Nash equilibrium]], every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 [[sex ratio]]s. {{harv|Fisher|1930}} suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.\n\nAdditionally, biologists have used [[evolutionary game theory]] and the ESS to explain the emergence of [[animal communication]].{{sfnp|Harper|Maynard Smith|2003}} The analysis of [[signaling games]] and [[Cheap talk|other communication games]] has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the [[mobbing behavior]] of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see [[Paul Ormerod]]'s ''[[Butterfly Economics]]'').\n\nBiologists have used the [[Chicken (game)|game of chicken]] to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Maynard Smith |first1=John |authorlink=John Maynard Smith |title=The theory of games and the evolution of animal conflicts |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013221 |year=1974 |pmid=4459582 |url=http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4448.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maynard Smith, in the preface to ''Evolution and the Theory of Games'', \"paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed\". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.<ref name=\"stan-egt\">{{cite web |editorlink=Edward N.

McKenzie |last=Alexander}}</ref>\n\nOne such phenomenon is known as [[Altruism in animals|biological altruism]]. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to [[vervet monkey]]s that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.<ref name=\"qudzyh\">{{cite web |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/ |title=Biological Altruism |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=3 June 2003 |access-date=3 January 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |df=mdy-all |editorlink=Edward N. Zalta |first=Samir |last=Okasha}}</ref> All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.\n\nEvolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of [[kin selection]]. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. [[Hamilton's rule]] explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation {{Math|c < b &times; r}}, where the cost {{varserif|c}} to the altruist must be less than the benefit {{varserif|b}} to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness {{varserif|r}}. The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of {{frac|1|2}}, because (on average) an individual shares half of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.<ref name=\"qudzyh\" /> The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was {{frac|1|2}} in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.\n\n===Computer science and logic===\nGame theory has come to play an increasingly important role in [[logic]] and in [[computer science]]. Several logical theories have a basis in [[game semantics]]. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model [[interactive computation]]s. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of [[multi-agent system]]s.<ref name=\"ShohamLeyton-Brown2008\">{{cite book |first1=Yoav |last1=Shoham |first2=Kevin |last2=Leyton-Brown |title=Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMR_qScakukC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22game%20theory%22&f=false|date=15 December 2008 |df=mdy-all |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-47524-2}}</ref>\n\nSeparately, game theory has played a role in [[online algorithm]]s; in particular, the [[k-server problem|{{var|k}}-server problem]], which has in the past been referred to as ''games with moving costs'' and ''request-answer games''.<ref>{{harvard citations |last1=Ben David |last2=Borodin |last3=Karp |last4=Tardos |last5=Wigderson |year=1994 |txt}}</ref> [[Yao's principle]] is a game-theoretic technique for proving [[Upper and lower bounds|lower bounds]] on the [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of [[randomized algorithm]]s, especially online algorithms.\n\nThe emergence of the Internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets.

Responding to two papers by {{harvard citations|txt=yes|first=W.V.O.|last=Quine|author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|year=1960|year2=1967}}, {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} used game theory to develop a philosophical account of [[Convention (norm)|convention]]. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] and employed it in analyzing play in [[coordination game]]s. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] in terms of [[signaling games]]. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Skyrms|1996}}</ref><ref>{{harvard citations |txt=yes |last1=Grim |last2=Kokalis |last3=Alai-Tafti |last4=Kilb |last5=St Denis |year=2004}}).</ref> Following {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and [[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri]] (2006) have developed theories of [[social norms]] that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.<ref>{{citation |first=E. |last=Ullmann-Margalit |title=The Emergence of Norms |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0198244110 |url=https://archive.org/details/emergenceofnorms0024ullm }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Cristina |last=Bicchieri |authorlink=Cristina Bicchieri |title=The Grammar of Society: the Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0521573726}}</ref>\n\nGame theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive [[epistemology]]: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),<ref>{{citation |title=Self-Refuting Theories of Strategic Interaction: A Paradox of Common Knowledge |journal=Erkenntnis |volume=30 |issue=1\u20132 |year=1989 |pages=69\u201385 |doi=10.1007/BF00184816 |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |authorlink=Cristina Bicchieri}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |author1-link=Cristina Bicchieri |title=Rationality and Coordination |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-57444-0 |year=1993}}</ref> [[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms]] (1990),<ref>{{citation |first=Brian |last=Skyrms |authorlink=Brian Skyrms |title=The Dynamics of Rational Deliberation |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0674218857}}</ref> and [[Robert Stalnaker|Stalnaker]] (1999).<ref>{{citation |chapter=Knowledge, Belief, and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games |editor-first=Cristina |editor-last=Bicchieri |editor-link1=Cristina Bicchieri |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Jeffrey |editor3-first=Brian |editor3-last=Skyrms |title=The Logic of Strategy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0195117158}}</ref>\n\nIn [[ethics]], some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) {{Who|date=July 2012}} authors have attempted to pursue [[Thomas Hobbes]]' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the [[prisoner's dilemma]] present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general [[social contract]] view in [[political philosophy]] (for examples, see {{Harvtxt|Gauthier|1986}} and {{Harvtxt|Kavka |1986}}).{{efn|For a more detailed discussion of the use of game theory in ethics, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/ game theory and ethics].}}\n\nOther authors have attempted to use [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, [[stag hunt]], and the [[Nash bargaining game]] as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last=Skyrms|year=1996|year2=2004}} and {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last1=Sober|last2=Wilson|year=1999}}).\n\n=== Retail and consumer product pricing ===\nGame theory applications are used heavily in the pricing strategies of retail and consumer markets, particularly for the sale of [[inelastic good]]s. With retailers constantly competing against one another for consumer market share, it has become a fairly common practice for retailers to discount certain goods, intermittently, in the hopes of increasing foot-traffic in [[brick and mortar]] locations (websites visits for [[e-commerce]] retailers) or increasing sales of ancillary or complimentary products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/robert.shumsky/GameTheoryModels.pdf|title=Game Theory Models of Pricing|last=Kopalle|last2=Shumsky|url-status=live|access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], a popular shopping holiday in the US, is when many retailers focus on optimal pricing strategies to capture the holiday shopping market. In the Black Friday scenario, retailers using game theory applications typically ask \u201cwhat is the dominant competitor\u2019s reaction to me?\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2017/09/18/how-e-commerce-uses-game-theory-to-capture-consumer-dollars/|title=How e-Commerce Uses Game Theory to Capture Consumer Dollars : Networks Course blog for INFO 2040/CS 2850/Econ 2040/SOC 2090|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> In such a scenario, the game has two players: the retailer, and the consumer. The retailer is focused on an optimal pricing strategy, while the consumer is focused on the best deal. In this closed system, there often is no dominant strategy as both players have alternative options. That is, retailers can find a different customer, and consumers can shop at a different retailer.<ref name=\":0\" /> Given the market competition that day, however, the dominant strategy for retailers lies in outperforming competitors. The open system assumes multiple retailers selling similar goods, and a finite number of consumers demanding the goods at an optimal price. A blog by a [[Cornell University]] professor provided an example of such a strategy, when [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] priced a Samsung TV $100 below retail value, effectively undercutting competitors. Amazon made up part of the difference by increasing the price of HDMI cables, as it has been found that consumers are less price discriminatory when it comes to the sale of secondary items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRetail markets continue to evolve strategies and applications of game theory when it comes to pricing consumer goods. The key insights found between simulations in a controlled environment and real-world retail experiences show that the applications of such strategies are more complex, as each retailer has to find an optimal balance between [[Pricing strategies|pricing]], [[Supplier relationship management|supplier relations]], [[brand image]], and the potential to [[Cannibalization (marketing)|cannibalize]] the sale of more profitable items.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://sfkcorp.com/2018/11/27/black-friday-games-concurrent-pricing-wars-for-a-competitive-advantage/|title=Black Friday Games: Concurrent pricing wars for a competitive advantage.|date=2018-11-27|website=SFK Inc. {{!}} SKK Marine {{!}} SFK SecCon|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Based on [[A Beautiful Mind (book)|the 1998 book]] by [[Sylvia Nasar]],<ref>Nasar, Sylvia (1998) ''A Beautiful Mind'', Simon & Schuster. {{isbn|0-684-81906-6}}.</ref> the life story of game theorist and mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] was turned into the 2001 [[biopic]] ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', starring [[Russell Crowe]] as Nash.<ref>Singh, Simon (14 June 1998)  [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/14/reviews/980614.14singht.html \"Between Genius and Madness\"], New York Times.</ref>\n* The 1959 [[military science fiction]] novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' by [[Robert A.

{"title_page": "Number line", "text_new": "{{short description|Geometrical representation of real numbers}}\n\n{{About|the mathematical concept|the printer's key|Printer's key}}\n{{hatnote|This article covers basic topics. For advanced topics, see [[Real line]].}}\n\nIn basic mathematics, a '''number line''' is a picture of a graduated straight [[line (geometry)|line]] that serves as abstraction for [[real number]]s, denoted by <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>. Every point of a number line is assumed to correspond to a [[real number]], and every real number to a point.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]]  | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13&ndash;19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[integer]]s are often shown as specially-marked squares oddly spaced on the line.  Although this image only shows the integers from &minus;9 to 9, the line includes all [[real number]]s, continuing forever in each direction, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is often used as an aid in teaching simple [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], especially involving [[negative number]]s.\n\n[[File:Number-line.svg|center|The number line]]\n\nIn advanced mathematics, the expressions ''real number line'', or ''[[real line]]'' are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].\n\n==History==\nThe first mention of the number line used for operation purposes is found in [[John Wallis]]'s ''Treatise of algebra''. <ref>Wallis, John (1685). ''Treatise of algebra''. http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/math/id/11231 pp. 265</ref>. In his treatise, Wallis describes addition and subtraction on a number line in terms of moving forward and backward, under the metaphor of a person walking.\n\nAn earlier depiction without mention to operations, though, is found in [[John Napier]]'s ''A description of the admirable table of logarithmes'', which shows values 1 through 12 lined up from left to right.<ref>Napier, John (1616). ''A description of the admirable table of logarithmes'' https://www.math.ru.nl/werkgroepen/gmfw/bronnen/napier1.html</ref>\n\nContrary to popular belief, [[Rene Descartes]]'s original [[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]] does not feature a number line, defined as we use it today, though it does use a coordinate system. In particular, Descartes's work does not contain specific numbers mapped onto lines, only abstract quantities.<ref>N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Rafael (2017). ''How Much Mathematics Is \"Hardwired\", If Any at All'' Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology: Culture and Developmental Systems, Volume 38. http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~nunez/COGS152_Readings/Nunez_ch3_MN.pdf pp. 98</ref>\n\n==Drawing the number line==\nA number line is usually represented as being [[horizontal plane|horizontal]], but in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate plane]] the vertical axis (y-axis) is also a number line.<ref name=purple>[http://www.purplemath.com/modules/plane.htm Introduction to the x,y-plane] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109025636/http://www.purplemath.com/modules/plane.htm |date=2015-11-09 }} \"Purplemath\" Retrieved 2015-11-13</ref> According to one convention, [[positive number]]s always lie on the right side of zero, [[negative number]]s always lie on the left side of zero, and arrowheads on both ends of the line are meant to suggest that the line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. Another convention uses only one arrowhead which indicates the direction in which numbers grow.<ref name=purple/> The line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative directions according to the rules of geometry which define a line without endpoints as an ''infinite line'', a line with one endpoint as a ''ray'', and a line with two endpoints as a ''line segment''.\n\n==Comparing numbers==\nIf a particular number is farther to the right on the number line than is another number, then the first number is greater than the second (equivalently, the second is less than the first). The distance between them is the magnitude of their difference&mdash;that is, it measures the first number minus the second one, or equivalently the absolute value of the second number minus the first one. Taking this difference is the process of [[subtraction]].\n\nThus, for example, the length of a [[line segment]] between 0 and some other number represents the magnitude of the latter number.\n\nTwo numbers can be [[addition|added]] by \"picking up\" the length from 0 to one of the numbers, and putting it down again with the end that was 0 placed on top of the other number.\n\nTwo numbers can be [[multiplication|multiplied]] as in this example: To multiply 5 \u00d7 3, note that this is the same as 5 + 5 + 5, so pick up the length from 0 to 5 and place it to the right of 5, and then pick up that length again and place it to the right of the previous result. This gives a result that is 3 combined lengths of 5 each; since the process ends at 15, we find that 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.\n\n[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] can be performed as in the following example: To divide 6 by 2&mdash;that is, to find out how many times 2 goes into 6&mdash;note that the length from 0 to 2 lies at the beginning of the length from 0 to 6; pick up the former length and put it down again to the right of its original position, with the end formerly at 0 now placed at 2, and then move the length to the right of its latest position again. This puts the right end of the length 2 at the right end of the length from 0 to 6. Since three lengths of 2 filled the length 6, 2 goes into 6 three times (that is, 6 \u00f7 2 = 3).\n\n<gallery widths=300>\nFile:Number line with x smaller than y.svg|The ordering on the number line: Greater elements are in direction of the arrow.\nFile:Number line with addition of -2 and 3.svg|The difference 3-2=3+(-2) on the real number line.\nFile:Number line with addition of 1 and 2.svg|The addition 1+2 on the real number line\nFile:Absolute difference.svg|The absolute difference.\nFile:Number line multiplication 2 with 1,5.svg|The multiplication 2 times 1.5\nFile:Number line division 3 with 2.svg|The division 3\u00f72 on the real number line\n</gallery>\n\n==Portions of the number line==\n[[File:Intervalo real 04.svg|thumb|The closed interval {{math|[a,b]}}.]]\nThe section of the number line between two numbers is called an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]].

Other choices are possible. \n\nOne of the most common choices is the ''logarithmic scale'', which is a representation of the ''positive'' numbers on a line, such that the distance of two points is the unit length, if the ratio of the represented numbers has a fixed value, typically 10. In such a logarithmic scale, the origin represents 1; one inch to the right, one has 10, one inch to the right of 10 one has {{nowrap|1=10\u00d710 = 100}}, then {{nowrap|1=10\u00d7100 = 1000 = 10<sup>3</sup>}}, then {{nowrap|1=10\u00d71000 = 10,000 = 10<sup>4</sup>}}, etc. Similarly, one inch to the left of 1, one has {{nowrap|1=1/10 = 10<sup>\u20131</sup>}}, then {{nowrap|1=1/100 = 10<sup>\u20132</sup>}}, etc.\n\nThis approach is useful, when one wants to represent, on the same figure, values with very different [[order of magnitude]]. For example, one requires a logarithmic scale for representing simultaneously the size of the different bodies that exist in the [[Universe]], typically, a [[photon]], an [[electron]], an [[atom]], a [[molecule]], a [[human]], the [[Earth]], the [[Solar System]], a [[galaxy]], and the visible Universe.\n\nLogarithmic scales are used in [[slide rule]]s for multiplying or dividing numbers by adding or subtracting lengths on logarithmic scales.\n[[File:slide rule example3.svg|frame|center|The two logarithmic scales of a slide rule]]\n\n===Combining number lines===\nA line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the [[imaginary number]]s. This line, called [[imaginary line (mathematics)|imaginary line]], extends the number line to a [[complex plane|complex number plane]], with points representing [[complex number]]s.\n\nAlternatively, one real number line can be drawn horizontally to denote possible values of one real number, commonly called ''x'', and another real number line can be drawn vertically to denote possible values of another real number, commonly called ''y''. Together these lines form what is known as a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], and any point in the plane represents the value of a pair of real numbers. Further, the Cartesian coordinate system can itself be extended by visualizing a third number line \"coming out of the screen (or page)\", measuring a third variable called ''z''. Positive numbers are closer to the viewer's eyes than the screen is, while negative numbers are \"behind the screen\"; larger numbers are farther from the screen.

For advanced topics, see [[Real line]].}}\n\nIn basic mathematics, a '''number line''' is a picture of a graduated straight [[line (geometry)|line]] that serves as abstraction for [[real number]]s, denoted by <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>. Every point of a number line is assumed to correspond to a [[real number]], and every real number to a point.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]]  | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13&ndash;19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[integer]]s are often shown as specially-marked points evenly spaced on the line.  Although this image only shows the integers from &minus;9 to 9, the line includes all [[real number]]s, continuing forever in each direction, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is often used as an aid in teaching simple [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], especially involving [[negative number]]s.\n\n[[File:Number-line.svg|center|The number line]]\n\nIn advanced mathematics, the expressions ''real number line'', or ''[[real line]]'' are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].\n\n==History==\nThe first mention of the number line used for operation purposes is found in [[John Wallis]]'s ''Treatise of algebra''. <ref>Wallis, John (1685). ''Treatise of algebra''. http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/math/id/11231 pp. 265</ref>. In his treatise, Wallis describes addition and subtraction on a number line in terms of moving forward and backward, under the metaphor of a person walking.\n\nAn earlier depiction without mention to operations, though, is found in [[John Napier]]'s ''A description of the admirable table of logarithmes'', which shows values 1 through 12 lined up from left to right.<ref>Napier, John (1616). ''A description of the admirable table of logarithmes'' https://www.math.ru.nl/werkgroepen/gmfw/bronnen/napier1.html</ref>\n\nContrary to popular belief, [[Rene Descartes]]'s original [[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]] does not feature a number line, defined as we use it today, though it does use a coordinate system. In particular, Descartes's work does not contain specific numbers mapped onto lines, only abstract quantities.<ref>N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Rafael (2017). ''How Much Mathematics Is \"Hardwired\", If Any at All'' Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology: Culture and Developmental Systems, Volume 38. http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~nunez/COGS152_Readings/Nunez_ch3_MN.pdf pp. 98</ref>\n\n==Drawing the number line==\nA number line is usually represented as being [[horizontal plane|horizontal]], but in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate plane]] the vertical axis (y-axis) is also a number line.<ref name=purple>[http://www.purplemath.com/modules/plane.htm Introduction to the x,y-plane] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109025636/http://www.purplemath.com/modules/plane.htm |date=2015-11-09 }} \"Purplemath\" Retrieved 2015-11-13</ref> According to one convention, [[positive number]]s always lie on the right side of zero, [[negative number]]s always lie on the left side of zero, and arrowheads on both ends of the line are meant to suggest that the line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. Another convention uses only one arrowhead which indicates the direction in which numbers grow.<ref name=purple/> The line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative directions according to the rules of geometry which define a line without endpoints as an ''infinite line'', a line with one endpoint as a ''ray'', and a line with two endpoints as a ''line segment''.\n\n==Comparing numbers==\nIf a particular number is farther to the right on the number line than is another number, then the first number is greater than the second (equivalently, the second is less than the first). The distance between them is the magnitude of their difference&mdash;that is, it measures the first number minus the second one, or equivalently the absolute value of the second number minus the first one. Taking this difference is the process of [[subtraction]].\n\nThus, for example, the length of a [[line segment]] between 0 and some other number represents the magnitude of the latter number.\n\nTwo numbers can be [[addition|added]] by \"picking up\" the length from 0 to one of the numbers, and putting it down again with the end that was 0 placed on top of the other number.\n\nTwo numbers can be [[multiplication|multiplied]] as in this example: To multiply 5 \u00d7 3, note that this is the same as 5 + 5 + 5, so pick up the length from 0 to 5 and place it to the right of 5, and then pick up that length again and place it to the right of the previous result.

Waze describes its app as a community-driven GPS navigation app, which is free to download and use.\n\nThe [[Israel]]i company [[Waze Mobile]] developed the Waze software. Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar and [[Uri Levine]] founded the company. Two Israeli [[venture capital]] firms, Magma and Vertex Ventures Israel, and an early-stage American [[venture capital]] firm, Bluerun Ventures, provided funding. [[Google]] acquired Waze Mobile in June 2013.\n\nThe app generates revenue from [[hyperlocal]] advertising to an estimated 130 million monthly users.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pressman |first=Aaron |last2=Lashinsky |first2=Adam |url=https://fortune.com/2019/10/11/waze-google-maps-how-it-works/ |title=Why Waze Doesn\u2019t Share Traffic Data With Google Maps\u2014Data Sheet |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=2019-10-11 |accessdate=2019-10-11 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Development===\nIn 2006, '''FreeMap Israel''' was a project founded and developed by [[Israel]]i programmer Ehud Shabtai as a community project, which aimed to create, with the crowd sourcing assistance of community users, a free digital database of the [[Geography of Israel|map of Israel]] in [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]], and to ensure its free content, update and distribution.<ref name=\"Terms & Conditions\">{{cite web |url=http://www.freemap.co.il/terms.html |title=Archive copy|website=Freemap Israel |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309014056/http://www.freemap.co.il/terms.html |archivedate=March 9, 2008}}</ref> In 2008, Shabtai formed a company called '''Waze''' to commercialize the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freemap.co.il/index.html |title=Archive copy|website=Freemap Israel |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207203404/http://freemap.co.il/index.html |archivedate=February 7, 2009}}</ref> The company name was changed to '''Waze Mobile Ltd''' in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, the company raised $25 million in the second round of funding.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Devindra |last1=Hardawar |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/12/07/waze-revs-up-crowdsourced-driving-app-with-25m/ |title=Waze revs up crowdsourced driving app with $25M |website=Venturebeat |date=December 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The company raised an additional $30 million in financing the following year.<ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite web|first1=Tomio|last1=Geron|accessdate=May 5, 2019|title=Waze Nabs $30M From Kleiner Perkins, Li Ka Shing;

Waze can also identify the cheapest fuel station near a user or along their route, provided Waze has enabled fuel prices for that country.\n\nWaze can be used anywhere in the world but requires enough initial users to create the maps and continuously update data to make it useful. Currently, only 13 countries have a full base map; the others are incompletely mapped, requiring users to record roads and edit maps.\n\nWaze offers turn-by-turn voice navigation, real-time traffic, and other location-specific alerts. Waze encourages users to report traffic or road hazards by offering points.<ref>{{cite web |last=Furchgott |first=Roy |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/filling-in-the-map-gaps-with-waze-games/ |title=Waze in a New York Times blog |work=The New York Times |date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===OS support===\nWaze supports [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iPhone]], while [[Symbian OS|Symbian]], [[BlackBerry 10]] (except BlackBerry Q10),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.waze.com/forum/faq.php |title=Waze FAQs |publisher=Waze |accessdate=August 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708113343/http://world.waze.com/faq/ |archivedate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> [[Windows Phone 8]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/waze/f07f83eb-a8a4-49fd-8946-c67a9349e062 |title=Waze |date=November 20, 2013 |work=Windows |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> and [[Windows Mobile]] from version 5<ref>[https://www.waze.com/support/ Waze Support, Quick Help.] Type \"Windows mobile\" in search box.

Waze users are able to report a multitude of traffic-related incidents from accidents to police traps. This data is used by Waze to help other users either by alerting them of the condition ahead or rerouting the user to avoid the area entirely. In addition to user input, Waze relies on information from state agencies for traffic events such as road construction. The idea behind this is that the more people that provide data the more accurate it will be.<ref>{{cite journal |first1= Michael |last1= Pack |first2=Nikola |last2=Ivanov |url=https://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=380807&article_id=2701553 |title=Are You Gonna Go My Waze?

Map editors are allowed to make changes to the map based on where they have driven while using Waze as well as their rank which is based on how many map edits a user has made.\nIn June 2013, Waze introduced a global localization project that enables future road closures and real-time traffic updates during major events in a given country, for example [[Tour de France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.waze.com/blog/how-to-beat-epic-traffic-caused-by-summer-events/ |title=Waze Blog: How to Beat Epic Traffic Caused by Summer Events |publisher=Waze |date=June 27, 2013 |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref> Google also acquired Waze in the same month.

The name ''Villa Boscoreale'' is typically used for any one of these villas.\n\nIn Roman times this area was agricultural, specialising in wine and olive oil.<ref>Hornblower, Simon and Antony Spawforth.

The villa is a comfortable working farm rather than a luxurious estate that others nearby were. Nonetheless an elegant central courtyard is colonnaded on three sides with columns of red and white stucco.\n\nLarge quantities of pottery and farm implements were found. Plaster casts of the original entrance doors were made from the hollow spaces left. A plaster cast of a pig found here and killed in the catastrophe was also made.\n\nIt also includes preserved parts of a wine press.<ref>http://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/RV/villa%20regina%20boscoreale%20p1.htm</ref> Near the centre of the villa is the wine cellar in which 18 ''[[dolium|dolia]]'', of total capacity 10,000 litres, were buried for storing the [[must]] from the adjoining press.\n\nAn unusual find was an oil lamp dating from the 3-5th c. AD showing that the place was tunnelled into in the later Roman era.\n\nThe holes in the ground left by the roots of the Roman vines were found and vines have again been planted in them.\n\n==Villa of P. Fannius Synistor==\n[[File:La villa pompeiana plan.jpg|left|thumb|Plan of Villa of P. Fannius Synistor]]\n[[File:Glasschale, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|right|thumb|Transparent [[glass]] bowl of fruit. Detail from wall painting in Bedroom M of the Villa of P. Fannius Synistor]]\n\nAlthough the villa was of relatively modest size compared to others in the area and had no [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], pool or sculpture collection, its frescoes were exceptional in their beauty and quality.<ref>\"Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale: The Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor in Reality and Virtual Reality\" Bergmann et al.,  The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin Spring 2010</ref>\n\nEvidence in tablets and [[graffiti]] shows that the house was probably built around 40-30 BC.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale.\" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' Winter 1987-88: 17-36.</ref> The villa was privately discovered, excavated, partially dismantled and reburied in 1900.\n\nThe villa had three stories, complete with a bath suite and an underground passage to a stable and agricultural buildings, the latter not excavated. The central ground floor of the living quarters consisted of over thirty rooms or enclosures surrounding a [[peristyle]]. The building featured an impressive main entrance approached by five broad steps leading to a colonnaded forecourt rather than the typical atrium.\n\nOwnership of the villa has been contested. While there is no doubt P. Fannius Synistor did reside there, excavated bronze tablets show another name, that of Lucius Herennius Florus. Many things were marked with seals in ancient Rome to indicate possession. It is believed that since the tablet with the letters \"L. HER. FLO\" on it was found inside the villa, it must serve as a mark of villa ownership.<ref>Milne, Margerie J. \"A Bronze Stamp from Boscoreale.\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 09. 1930: 188-190.</ref> These two are the only confirmed owners in the early 1st century BC and 1st century AD, though there may have been earlier owners.\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Boscoreale1.jpg|thumb|Wall fresco of a seated woman with a [[kithara]], 40-30 BC, from the Villa Boscoreale of P.

Paul Getty Trust). {{ISBN|0-89236-633-8}}, pp. 22\u201323.</ref>]]\n\nThe Villa is most notable for its wonderful works of art, especially its highly skilled [[buon fresco]] paintings, said to be the highest quality Roman frescoes ever found<ref>\"Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale: The Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor in Reality and Virtual Reality\" Bergmann et al.,  The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin Spring 2010, p 14</ref> and which are now scattered around the world after being auctioned following removal.\n\nMost of the figures in the frescoes have characteristics of Greek [[Hellenistic art|Hellenism]] or [[Classicism]]. For instance, those found in the living room appear to be depictions of either philosophers, such as [[Epicurus]], [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] or [[Menedemus]], or possibly old kings, like King Kinyras of Cyprus.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 29</ref> Similarly, the bedrooms of the Second Style also evoke Hellenistic qualities, such as are seen at the Tomb of Lyson or at Kallikles.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 31</ref> At a time when the Roman Republic was ending and classicism somewhat fading, this is considered as an interesting comment on style and taste. Seemingly, Greek representations in the home were considered acceptable, even admired and sophisticated. The images survived the quick succession of Vesuvian cataclysms because of the skill of the fresco work and the absence of organic materials such as [[indigo]], [[murex]] purple, red [[Rose madder|madder]] among its pigments. The reddening of some of its [[yellow ochre]] shows temperatures to have exceeded 300&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Rudolf Meyer, \"The Conservation of the Frescoes from Boscoreale in the Metropolitan Museum, in ''Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale''.</ref>\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], together with [[King's College, London]], is building a [[virtual model]] of the Villa, linking the scattered frescoes, based on the notes and plan drawn at the time of excavation by archaeologist Felice Barnabei (1902), photographs taken of the excavation, the research of Phyllis W. Lehmann (1953) and [[axonometric]] drawings of the plan, locating the images on the walls, by Maxwell Anderson (1987).<ref>Bettina Bergmann et al., Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale: The Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor in Reality and Virtual Reality (Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 62.4 [Spring 2010]). This, the most recent work on the Villa, is the main source for information not otherwise attributed.</ref>\n\n===Metropolitan Museum cubiculum reconstruction===\nThe fullest reconstruction from original frescoes at present is of a bedroom (''cubiculum diurnum''), one of the holdings of the Metropolitan Museum since 1903, and since 2007 a feature of the new Roman Gallery. It consists of most of a newly cleaned and reconstructed set of walls entirely painted in highly accomplished fresco.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 17</ref> These spacious Roman II Style murals represent their walls as open above [[Socle (architecture)|socle]] or [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] height, except for the [[architrave]]s above and a few columns that, together with those other features, frame vividly coloured architectural views of buildings, columns, landscape, garden scenes, religious statues, beyond, emphasizing expansion and grandeur, but including no humans and only a few birds on the short, window wall. This is also the technique in other unreconstructed rooms. For example, In another bedroom, known as Room M, the frescoes depict columns that appear to expand into another room, giving the sense of a much larger, almost unending, space. The facing long walls (19&nbsp;ft or 5.8 m) of the Metropolitan cubiculum are mirror images of each other, possibly by transfer, with variations. In addition, each is divided into four panels by painted columns.\n\nDistance in these paintings is built up through a series of [[orthogonal]] architectural surfaces, and indicated by overlap [[Occultation|occlusion]], [[foreshortening]], [[diminution]], pronounced [[aerial perspective]], but without [[vanishing point]]s. Modelling is indicated by side-[[shading]] with slight, selective cast shadow. Pompeian red in front planes, contrasting with the blue tone of the fainter, further planes, provides an additional effective cue for depth. The room had one, north-facing, outside window, through which [[pyroclastic flows]] from Vesuvius appear to have entered. As part of the sophisticated depictive scheme, the dado or lower parts of the walls are depicted as themselves, but in First Style. Ledges and niches there show near objects: \"metal and glass vases on shelves and tables appearing to project out from the wall\", playfully belying the common impression that perspective is always for depicting recession from the picture plane.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 21</ref> In other parts of the Villa there are brightly colored nonfigurative walls, in First Style, some of which are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the [[Louvre Museum]].\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nImage:Cubiculum (bedroom) from the Villa of P.

Everything was still in place and arrangement of the objects were exactly as they would normally have been: furnishings, bronze bathtubs decorated with masks in the shape of lion heads seemed to be ready for use. In a large chest there were fifty keys and silver tableware; in the kitchen the skeleton of a dog on a chain; in the stable the bones of several tethered horses, one of which had managed to wriggle out and escape. In the pressing-room (''torcularium'') the first three human skeletons came to light, including that of a woman, probably the mistress of the house, who wore splendid gold earrings with topaz jewels.<ref>Egon Caesar Conte Corti, \nThe Destruction and Resurrection of Pompeii and Herculaneum Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1951</ref>\n\nIn 1895 on the floor of the wine cellar a dead man was found in the midst of the so-called [[Boscoreale Treasure]]  consisting of 102 items: silver tableware, bracelets, earrings, rings, a double gold chain. The last owner of the silver was probably a woman named Maxima, a name written on many of the vessels. A thousand gold coins were still in the remains of a leather bag. The treasure had been found in the torcularium which at the time of the eruption was probably one of the safest rooms in the villa and probably the owner gave the order to a trusted man to hide it for better times.\n\nAll the treasure was smuggled out to France and sold.\n\nThe excavations of the villa were then resumed in 1896 by Angiolo Pasqui: it consisted of the main residence, to the north-west, and a ''pars rustica'', the production and service areas. The breeding of farmyard animals was practiced and most of the rooms on the ground floor were used for processing and conservation of oil, wine and cereals. \n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>>\nImage:All\u00e9gorie de la province romaine d&#039;Afrique - Grand Palais, Paris 2014.jpg|Silver gilt dish with head of Cleopatra Selene II, Queen of Mauretania\n\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book|last=Hornblower|first=Simon|author2=Antony Spawforth|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198661726/page/254 254]|isbn=0-19-866172-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198661726/page/254}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Milne|first=Margerie J.|title=A Bronze Stamp from Boscoreale|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|issue=09|year=1930|pages=188\u2013190|doi=10.2307/3255709|volume=25|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|jstor=3255709}}\n*{{cite journal|title=The Villa of P.

Nevertheless, among the most important finds from these others are the exquisite frescoes from the Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor and the sumptuous [[Boscoreale Treasure|silver collection]] of the Villa della Pisanella, which are now displayed in several major museums. The name ''Villa Boscoreale'' is typically used for any one of these villas.\n\nIn Roman times this area was agricultural, specialising in wine and olive oil.<ref>Hornblower, Simon and Antony Spawforth. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. London: Oxford University Press, 1996. 254.</ref>\n\nInformation on, and objects from, the villas can be seen in the nearby Antiquarium di Boscoreale.\n\n==Other Villas in Boscoreale==\n\nMany other Roman villas were discovered in the vicinity, often by \"treasure\" hunters towards the end of the 19th century, and then reburied, include notably those:\n* in \"d'Acunzo property\", Piazza.

The villa is a comfortable working farm rather than a luxurious estate that others nearby were. Nonetheless an elegant central courtyard is colonnaded on three sides with columns of red and white stucco.\n\nLarge quantities of pottery and farm implements were found. Plaster casts of the original entrance doors were made from the hollow spaces left. A plaster cast of a pig found here and killed in the catastrophe was also made.\n\nIt also includes preserved parts of a wine press.<ref>http://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/RV/villa%20regina%20boscoreale%20p1.htm</ref> Near the centre of the villa is the wine cellar in which 18 ''[[dolium|dolia]]'', of total capacity 10,000 litres, were buried for storing the [[must]] from the adjoining press.\n\nAn unusual find was an oil lamp dating from the 3-5th c. AD showing that the place was tunnelled into in the later Roman era.\n\nThe holes in the ground left by the roots of the Roman vines were found and vines have again been planted in them.\n\n==Villa of P. Fannius Synistor==\n[[File:La villa pompeiana plan.jpg|left|thumb|Plan of Villa of P. Fannius Synistor]]\n[[File:Glasschale, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|right|thumb|Transparent [[glass]] bowl of fruit. Detail from wall painting in Bedroom M of the Villa of P. Fannius Synistor]]\n\nAlthough the villa was of relatively modest size compared to others in the area and had no [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], pool or sculpture collection, its frescoes were exceptional in their beauty and quality.<ref>\"Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale: The Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor in Reality and Virtual Reality\" Bergmann et al.,  The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin Spring 2010</ref>\n\nEvidence in tablets and [[graffiti]] shows that the house was probably built around 40-30 BC.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale.\" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' Winter 1987-88: 17-36.</ref> The villa was privately discovered, excavated, partially dismantled and reburied in 1900.\n\nThe villa had three stories, complete with a bath suite and an underground passage to a stable and agricultural buildings, the latter not excavated. The central ground floor of the living quarters consisted of over thirty rooms or enclosures surrounding a [[peristyle]]. The building featured an impressive main entrance approached by five broad steps leading to a colonnaded forecourt rather than the typical atrium.\n\nOwnership of the villa has been contested. While there is no doubt P. Fannius Synistor did reside there, excavated bronze tablets show another name, that of Lucius Herennius Florus. Many things were marked with seals in ancient Rome to indicate possession. It is believed that since the tablet with the letters \"L. HER. FLO\" on it was found inside the villa, it must serve as a mark of villa ownership.<ref>Milne, Margerie J. \"A Bronze Stamp from Boscoreale.\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 09. 1930: 188-190.</ref> These two are the only confirmed owners in the early 1st century BC and 1st century AD, though there may have been earlier owners.\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Boscoreale1.jpg|thumb|Wall fresco of a seated woman with a [[kithara]], 40-30 BC, from the Villa Boscoreale of P. Fannius Synistor; Late [[Roman Republic]], but most likely representing [[Berenice II]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] wearing a ''stephane'' (i.e. royal [[diadem]]) on her head<ref>Pfrommer, Michael; Towne-Markus, Elana (2001).

Paul Getty Trust). {{ISBN|0-89236-633-8}}, pp. 22\u201323.</ref>]]\n\nThe Villa is most notable for its wonderful works of art, especially its highly skilled [[buon fresco]] paintings, said to be the highest quality Roman frescoes ever found<ref>\"Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale: The Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor in Reality and Virtual Reality\" Bergmann et al.,  The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin Spring 2010, p 14</ref> and which are now scattered around the world after being auctioned following removal.\n\nMost of the figures in the frescoes have characteristics of Greek [[Hellenistic art|Hellenism]] or [[Classicism]]. For instance, those found in the living room appear to be depictions of either philosophers, such as [[Epicurus]], [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] or [[Menedemus]], or possibly old kings, like King Kinyras of Cyprus.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 29</ref> Similarly, the bedrooms of the Second Style also evoke Hellenistic qualities, such as are seen at the Tomb of Lyson or at Kallikles.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 31</ref> At a time when the Roman Republic was ending and classicism somewhat fading, this is considered as an interesting comment on style and taste. Seemingly, Greek representations in the home were considered acceptable, even admired and sophisticated. The images survived the quick succession of Vesuvian cataclysms because of the skill of the fresco work and the absence of organic materials such as [[indigo]], [[murex]] purple, red [[Rose madder|madder]] among its pigments. The reddening of some of its [[yellow ochre]] shows temperatures to have exceeded 300&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Rudolf Meyer, \"The Conservation of the Frescoes from Boscoreale in the Metropolitan Museum, in ''Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale''.</ref>\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], together with [[King's College, London]], is building a [[virtual model]] of the Villa, linking the scattered frescoes, based on the notes and plan drawn at the time of excavation by archaeologist Felice Barnabei (1902), photographs taken of the excavation, the research of Phyllis W. Lehmann (1953) and [[axonometric]] drawings of the plan, locating the images on the walls, by Maxwell Anderson (1987).<ref>Bettina Bergmann et al., Roman Frescoes from Boscoreale: The Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor in Reality and Virtual Reality (Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 62.4 [Spring 2010]). This, the most recent work on the Villa, is the main source for information not otherwise attributed.</ref>\n\n===Metropolitan Museum cubiculum reconstruction===\nThe fullest reconstruction from original frescoes at present is of a bedroom (''cubiculum diurnum''), one of the holdings of the Metropolitan Museum since 1903, and since 2007 a feature of the new Roman Gallery. It consists of most of a newly cleaned and reconstructed set of walls entirely painted in highly accomplished fresco.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 17</ref> These spacious Roman II Style murals represent their walls as open above [[Socle (architecture)|socle]] or [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] height, except for the [[architrave]]s above and a few columns that, together with those other features, frame vividly coloured architectural views of buildings, columns, landscape, garden scenes, religious statues, beyond, emphasizing expansion and grandeur, but including no humans and only a few birds on the short, window wall. This is also the technique in other unreconstructed rooms. For example, In another bedroom, known as Room M, the frescoes depict columns that appear to expand into another room, giving the sense of a much larger, almost unending, space. The facing long walls (19&nbsp;ft or 5.8 m) of the Metropolitan cubiculum are mirror images of each other, possibly by transfer, with variations. In addition, each is divided into four panels by painted columns.\n\nDistance in these paintings is built up through a series of [[orthogonal]] architectural surfaces, and indicated by overlap [[Occultation|occlusion]], [[foreshortening]], [[diminution]], pronounced [[aerial perspective]], but without [[vanishing point]]s. Modelling is indicated by side-[[shading]] with slight, selective cast shadow. Pompeian red in front planes, contrasting with the blue tone of the fainter, further planes, provides an additional effective cue for depth. The room had one, north-facing, outside window, through which [[pyroclastic flows]] from Vesuvius appear to have entered. As part of the sophisticated depictive scheme, the dado or lower parts of the walls are depicted as themselves, but in First Style. Ledges and niches there show near objects: \"metal and glass vases on shelves and tables appearing to project out from the wall\", playfully belying the common impression that perspective is always for depicting recession from the picture plane.<ref>\"The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale\" p. 21</ref> In other parts of the Villa there are brightly colored nonfigurative walls, in First Style, some of which are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the [[Louvre Museum]].\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nImage:Cubiculum (bedroom) from the Villa of P.

Everything was still in place and arrangement of the objects were exactly as they would normally have been: furnishings, bronze bathtubs decorated with masks in the shape of lion heads seemed to be ready for use. In a large chest there were fifty keys and silver tableware; in the kitchen the skeleton of a dog on a chain; in the stable the bones of several tethered horses, one of which had managed to wriggle out and escape. In the pressing-room (''torcularium'') the first three human skeletons came to light, including that of a woman, probably the mistress of the house, who wore splendid gold earrings with topaz jewels.<ref>Egon Caesar Conte Corti, \nThe Destruction and Resurrection of Pompeii and Herculaneum Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1951</ref>\n\nIn 1895 on the floor of the wine cellar a dead man was found in the midst of the so-called [[Boscoreale Treasure]]  consisting of 102 of wonderful exquisite items: silver tableware, bracelets, earrings, rings, a double gold chain. The last owner of the silver was probably a woman named Maxima, a name written on many of the vessels. A thousand gold coins were still in the remains of a leather bag. The treasure had been found in the torcularium which at the time of the eruption was probably one of the safest rooms in the villa and probably the owner gave the order to a trusted man to hide it for better times.\n\nAll the treasure was smuggled out to France and sold.\n\nThe excavations of the villa were then resumed in 1896 by Angiolo Pasqui: it consisted of the main residence, to the north-west, and a ''pars rustica'', the production and service areas. The breeding of farmyard animals was practiced and most of the rooms on the ground floor were used for processing and conservation of oil, wine and cereals. \n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>>\nImage:All\u00e9gorie de la province romaine d&#039;Afrique - Grand Palais, Paris 2014.jpg|Silver gilt dish with head of Cleopatra Selene II, Queen of Mauretania\n\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book|last=Hornblower|first=Simon|author2=Antony Spawforth|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198661726/page/254 254]|isbn=0-19-866172-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198661726/page/254}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Milne|first=Margerie J.|title=A Bronze Stamp from Boscoreale|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|issue=09|year=1930|pages=188\u2013190|doi=10.2307/3255709|volume=25|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|jstor=3255709}}\n*{{cite journal|title=The Villa of P.

By 1819, there were 244 settlers, and by 1861 the population had risen to 4,901, many of whom were descendants of [[United Empire Loyalists]], veterans of the [[War of 1812]] who had been granted land there, or the original and later settlers from Ireland. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the population began to drop as many families left for Western Canada.<ref name=histsoc>{{cite web |title=Home page |url=http://www.kawartha.net/~mchs/mchs.htm |publisher=Millbrook and Cavan Historical Society |accessdate=2009-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513052212/http://www.kawartha.net/~mchs/mchs.htm |archivedate=2009-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe original Irish settlers were [[Protestants]], and many of them were associated with the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. In the mid-19th century the \"Cavan Blazers\" were established as a fiercely Protestant vigilante group, who often burned down the farms of Catholic settlers.<ref name=histsoc />\n\nThe Township of Cavan and the Village of Millbrook, previously part of [[Durham County, Ontario|Durham County]], in 1974 became part of Peterborough County, and were amalgamated, along with North Monaghan, into one township \u2014 Cavan-Millbrook-North Monaghan \u2014 in 1998. In 2007, the township was renamed Cavan Monaghan,<ref>{{cite web|title= By-law Number 2007-19|url= http://www.cmnm.ca/2007%20By-Laws/By-Law%202007-19%20Name%20Change%20By-Law.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065800/http://www.cmnm.ca/2007%20By-Laws/By-Law%202007-19%20Name%20Change%20By-Law.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2007-09-30|format= PDF|publisher= Corporation of the Township of Cavan Millbrook=North Monaghan|date= 2007-04-02|accessdate= 2009-05-08}}</ref> as many thought the older name was too long.\n\n==Communities==\nThe township of Cavan Monaghan comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Carmel, Cavan, Cedar Valley, Five Mile Turn, Fraserville, Ida, Millbrook, Mount Pleasant, South Monaghan / Centreville (partially), Springville, Tapley; Bailieboro (partially), Cavan Station, Dranoel, Fairmount, Kendry, Murray Hill.\n\nNone are incorporated and a couple are relegated to just names on a map as cars made transportation easier and service areas concentrated in fewer nodes.\n\n{|\n| [[File:Millbrook ON.JPG|thumb|none|240px|Millbrook]]\n| [[File:Ida ON.jpg|thumb|none|218px|Ida]]\n|}\n\n===Millbrook===\nMillbrook is the township's population centre. The commercial businesses and services (banking, government) are found along King Street and County Road 10. County Road 10 provides Millbrook with convenient connections with [[Ontario Highway 115]] and [[Ontario Highway 401]].\n\nIt has been a filming location for several movie productions. ''[[Anne with an E]]'' (a 2017 CBC production), ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]''  (a 2011 CBC production), ''[[The Music Man (2003 film)|The Music Man]]'', ''[[Ice Princess]]'', ''The Town Christmas Forgot'' and ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' were filmed in the town. In the latter film, Millbrook was depicted as the fictional town of Millbrook, [[Indiana]].\n\nThe [[political cartoonist]] [[Sam Hunter (cartoonist)|Sam Hunter]] was born and raised in Millbrook, along with award-winning filmmaker Jared Raab, esteemed Aquatic Science Biologist Dustin Raab with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and [[Juno Award]] winner singer/songwriter [[Serena Ryder]].\n\n==Economy==\n\nCavan is home to Alltech's corn feed facility under the Masterfeeds brand. It was formerly owned by [[Maple Leaf Foods]] which opened a feed facility on [[List of numbered roads in Peterborough County|Peterborough County Road 10]] just north of [[Ontario Highway 35]]. Opened in 1975, the facility was then owned by Maple Leaf Mills, which relocated from the [[Maple Leaf Mills Silos]] in downtown

[[Ontario]], Canada, {{convert|20|km}} southwest of the city of Peterborough.\n\n==History==\nThe original townships of Cavan and Monaghan were surveyed by [[John Deyell]] in 1817, and were named after [[County Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan]] in [[Ireland]], from which many of its settlers had emigrated. By 1819, there were 244 settlers, and by 1861 the population had risen to 4,901, many of whom were descendants of [[United Empire Loyalists]], veterans of the [[War of 1812]] who had been granted land there, or the original and later settlers from Ireland. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the population began to drop as many families left for Western Canada.<ref name=histsoc>{{cite web |title=Home page |url=http://www.kawartha.net/~mchs/mchs.htm |publisher=Millbrook and Cavan Historical Society |accessdate=2009-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513052212/http://www.kawartha.net/~mchs/mchs.htm |archivedate=2009-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe original Irish settlers were [[Protestants]], and many of them were associated with the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. In the mid-19th century the \"Cavan Blazers\" were established as a fiercely Protestant vigilante group, who often burned down the farms of Catholic settlers.<ref name=histsoc />\n\nThe Township of Cavan and the Village of Millbrook, previously part of [[Durham County, Ontario|Durham County]], in 1974 became part of Peterborough County, and were amalgamated, along with North Monaghan, into one township \u2014 Cavan-Millbrook-North Monaghan \u2014 in 1998. In 2007, the township was renamed Cavan Monaghan,<ref>{{cite web|title= By-law Number 2007-19|url= http://www.cmnm.ca/2007%20By-Laws/By-Law%202007-19%20Name%20Change%20By-Law.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065800/http://www.cmnm.ca/2007%20By-Laws/By-Law%202007-19%20Name%20Change%20By-Law.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2007-09-30|format= PDF|publisher= Corporation of the Township of Cavan Millbrook=North Monaghan|date= 2007-04-02|accessdate= 2009-05-08}}</ref> as many thought the older name was too long.\n\n==Communities==\nThe township of Cavan Monaghan comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Carmel, Cavan, Cedar Valley, Five Mile Turn, Fraserville, Ida, Millbrook, Mount Pleasant, South Monaghan / Centreville (partially), Springville, Tapley; Bailieboro (partially), Cavan Station, Dranoel, Fairmount, Kendry, Murray Hill.\n\nNone are incorporated and a couple are relegated to just names on a map as cars made transportation easier and service areas concentrated in fewer nodes.\n\n{|\n| [[File:Millbrook ON.JPG|thumb|none|240px|Millbrook]]\n| [[File:Ida ON.jpg|thumb|none|218px|Ida]]\n|}\n\n===Millbrook===\nMillbrook is the township's population centre. The commercial businesses and services (banking, government) are found along King Street and County Road 10. County Road 10 provides Millbrook with convenient connections with [[Ontario Highway 115]] and [[Ontario Highway 401]].\n\nIt has been a filming location for several movie productions. ''[[Anne with an E]]'' (a 2017 CBC production), ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]''  (a 2011 CBC production), ''[[The Music Man (2003 film)|The Music Man]]'', ''[[Ice Princess]]'', ''The Town Christmas Forgot'' and ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' were filmed in the town. In the latter film, Millbrook was depicted as the fictional town of Millbrook, [[Indiana]].\n\nThe [[political cartoonist]] [[Sam Hunter (cartoonist)|Sam Hunter]] was born and raised in Millbrook, along with award-winning filmmaker Jared Raab, esteemed Aquatic Science Biologist Dustin Raab with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and [[Juno Award]] winner singer/songwriter [[Serena Ryder]].\n\n==Economy==\n\nCavan is home to Alltech's corn feed facility under the Masterfeeds brand. It was formerly owned by [[Maple Leaf Foods]] which opened a feed facility on [[List of numbered roads in Peterborough County|Peterborough County Road 10]] just north of [[Ontario Highway 35]]. Opened in 1975 the facility was then owned by Maple Leaf Mills, which relocated from the [[Maple Leaf Mills Silos]] in downtown [[Toronto]].<ref>http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/ClaPL/CLaPL002842929pf_0018.pdf</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Cavan Monaghan historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|percentages = \n|footnote    =<ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], [[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]</ref><ref name=\"cp2011a\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]| 8453\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]| 8828\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]| 8601\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]| 8829\n}}\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=8,829 | 2016_pop_delta=+2.7 | 2016_land_area=306.33 | 2016_pop_density=28.8\n |2016_median_age=46.1 | 2016_median_age_m=45.6 | 2016_median_age_f=46.6\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=3,271 | 2016_mean_hh_income=90,957 | 2016_access_date=2019-06-30\n |2011_population=8,601 | 2011_pop_delta=-2.6 | 2011_land_area=306.22 | 2011_pop_density=28.1\n |2011_median_age= | 2011_median_age_m= | 2011_median_age_f=\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=3,221 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-03-09\n |2006_population=8,828 | 2006_pop_delta=4.4 | 2006_land_area=306.13 | 2006_pop_density=28.8\n |2006_median_age=42.5 | 2006_median_age_m=42.3 | 2006_median_age_f=42.7\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=3,088 | 2006_mean_hh_income=73,654 | 2006_access_date=2012-03-09\n |2001_population=8,453 | 2001_pop_delta=2.4 | 2001_land_area=306.13 | 2001_pop_density=27.6\n |2001_median_age=39.1 | 2001_median_age_m=38.7 | 2001_median_age_f=39.5\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=2,951 | 2001_mean_hh_income=59,950 | 2001_access_date=2012-03-09\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of townships in Ontario]]\n*[[List of correctional facilities in Ontario]] [[Vehicle registration plates of Ontario|Ontario Licence Plates]] were made at the Millbrook Correctional Centre, 1974-2003.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"cp2011a\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3515013&Geo2=CD&Code2=3515&Data=Count&SearchText=Cavan&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Cavan Monaghan census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cavanmonaghan.net/siteengine/activepage.asp Township of Cavan-Monaghan]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Cavan Monaghan\n | North     = [[Kawartha Lakes]]\n | Northeast = [[Selwyn, Ontario|Selwyn]]\n | East      = [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]<br>[[Otonabee\u2013South Monaghan]]\n | Southeast = [[Hamilton, Ontario (township)|Hamilton Township]]\n | South     = [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]]\n | Southwest = [[Clarington]]\n | West      = [[Kawartha Lakes]]\n | Northwest = \n}}\n\n{{Peterborough County}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cavan Monaghan}}\n[[Category:Lower-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Municipalities in Peterborough County]]\n[[Category:Township municipalities in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "InedibleHulk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEconomy:Comma.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Monaghan"}

The two main groups of deer are the [[Cervinae]], including the [[muntjac]], the [[elk]] (wapiti), the [[fallow deer]], and the [[chital]]; and the [[Capreolinae]], including the [[reindeer]] (caribou), the [[roe deer]], and the [[moose]]. Female reindeer, and male deer of all species except the Chinese [[water deer]], grow and shed new [[antler]]s each year. In this they differ from permanently [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]ed [[antelope]], which are part of a different family ([[Bovidae]]) within the same order of [[even-toed ungulates]] (Artiodactyla).\n\nThe [[musk deer]] ([[Moschidae]]) of Asia and [[chevrotain]]s ([[Chevrotain|Tragulidae]]) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families within the ruminant clade ([[Ruminantia]]). They are no more closely related to deer than are other even-toed ungulates.\n\nDeer appear in art from [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s onwards, and they have [[deer in mythology|played a role in mythology]], religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in [[heraldry]]. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as [[venison]], their skins as soft, strong [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]], and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer [[hunting]] has been a popular activity since at least the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{anchor|doe}}\n[[File:Chital (8458215435).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chital]] deer in [[Nagarhole National Park|Nagarahole]], India]]\n\nDeer live in a variety of [[biome]]s, ranging from [[tundra]] to the [[tropical rainforest]]. While often associated with forests, many deer are [[ecotone]] species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the [[understory]] and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.\n\nDeer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the [[Barbary stag]], a subspecies of [[red deer]] that is confined to the [[Atlas Mountains]] in the northwest of the continent, an additional extinct species of giant deer ''[[Megaceroides|Megaceroides algericus]]'' was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago. [[Fallow deer]] have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of [[brocket deer]] and [[pud\u00fa]]s of Central and South America, and [[muntjac]]s of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the [[Indian muntjac]]. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the [[Reindeer|caribou]] that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and [[moose]] that inhabit [[taiga]] and adjacent areas. Huemul deer ([[taruca]] and [[South Andean deer|Chilean huemul]]) of South America's [[Andes]] fill the ecological niches of the [[ibex]] and [[wild goat]], with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the [[Canadian Rocky Mountains|Canadian Rocky Mountain]] and [[Columbia Mountains|Columbia Mountain]] regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species ([[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], caribou, [[elk]], and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]], [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], [[Yoho National Park]], and [[Kootenay National Park]] on the British Columbia side, and [[Banff National Park]], [[Jasper National Park]], and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]] on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and [[alpine tundra]] areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent [[Great Plains]] grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, [[American bison]], and [[pronghorn]] antelope.\n\n[[File:Reindeer-on-the-rocks.jpg|thumb|[[Reindeer]] herds, standing on snow to avoid flies]]\n\nThe [[Eurasia]]n Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower diversity in plant and animal species. However, many national parks and protected reserves in Europe do have populations of red deer, [[roe deer]], and fallow deer. These species have long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and Northwestern [[Iran]]. \"European\" fallow deer historically lived over much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day [[Turkey]].\n\nPresent-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct [[tarpan]] (forest horse), extinct [[aurochs]] (forest ox), and the endangered [[wisent]] (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the [[Scottish Highlands]], the Austrian [[Alps]], the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and some fine National Parks, including [[Do\u00f1ana National Park]] in Spain, the [[Veluwe]] in the Netherlands, the [[Ardennes]] in Belgium, and [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|Bia\u0142owie\u017ca National Park]] of Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, [[Eurasian lynx]], [[Iberian lynx]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], and [[brown bear]]s.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea, Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find [[Siberian roe deer]], [[sika deer]], elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the Sino-Russian border.\n\nDeer such as the sika deer, [[Thorold's deer]], [[Central Asian red deer]], and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by [[Han Chinese]], [[Turkic peoples]], [[Tungusic peoples]], [[Mongolia]]ns, and [[Koreans]]. Like the [[Sami people]] of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India's Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal's Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas that are home to [[chital]], [[hog deer]], [[barasingha]], Indian [[Sambar deer|sambar]], and [[Indian muntjac]]. Grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which [[Kanha National Park]], [[Dudhwa National Park]], and [[Chitwan National Park]] are most famous. Sri Lanka's [[Wilpattu National Park]] and [[Yala National Park]] have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.\n\nThe Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct [[Schomburgk's deer]], [[Eld's deer]], Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld's deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as [[Khao Yai National Park|Khao Yai]]. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other [[herbivory|herbivores]], such as [[Asian elephant]]s, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as [[nilgai]], [[four-horned antelope]], [[blackbuck]], and [[Chinkara|Indian gazelle]] in India), and wild oxen (such as [[wild Asian water buffalo]], [[gaur]], [[banteng]], and [[kouprey]]). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be some overlap.\n\nAustralia has six [[introduced species]] of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from [[acclimatisation society]] releases in the 19th century. These are the fallow deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, [[Javan rusa|rusa]], and chital. Red deer introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock were domesticated in [[deer farm]]s by the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.<ref name=\"DeerInNewZealand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/mammals-introduced/page-10|title=Deer|website=Te Ara: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|year=1966|editor-first=A.

A doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets, while not unknown, are uncommon). Mating season typically begins in later August and lasts until December. Some species mate until early March. The [[gestation period]] is anywhere up to ten months for the European roe deer. Most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots, though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter. In the first twenty minutes of a fawn's life, the fawn begins to take its first steps. Its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent, so [[predator]]s will not find it. Its mother leaves often to graze, and the fawn does not like to be left behind. Sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">[http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/mammals/deer.htm Deer \u2013 info and games] Sheppard Software.</ref> The fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother.

The name was popularised in the 18th century by [[James Macpherson]], creator of 'Ossianic poetry'.\n\n===In literature===\nDeer have been an integral part of fables and other literary works since the inception of writing. Stags were used as symbols in the latter Sumerian writings. For instance, the boat of Sumerian god Enki is named the ''Stag of Azbu''. There are several mentions of the animal in the [[Rigveda]] as well as the [[Bible]]. In the Indian epic [[Ramayana]], [[Sita]] is lured by a golden deer which [[Rama]] tries to catch. In the absence of both Rama and [[Lakshman]], [[Ravana]] kidnaps Sita. Many of the allegorical [[Aesop's fables]], such as \"The Stag at the Pool\", \"The One-Eyed Doe\" and \"The Stag and a Lion\", personify deer to give moral lessons. For instance, \"The Sick Stag\" gives the message that uncaring friends can do more harm than good.<ref name=guide/> The [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a pascola [from the Spanish 'pascua', Easter] dancer (also known as a deer dancer).

The next year, the baron encounters a stag with a [[cherry tree]] growing from its head; presumably this is the animal he had shot at the previous year.

In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1950 fantasy novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' the adult Pevensies, now kings and queens of [[Narnia]], chase the White Stag on a hunt, as the Stag is said to grant its captor a wish. The hunt is key in returning the Pevensies to their home in England. In the 1979 book ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (book)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]'', The Great White Stag is the leader of all the animals.\n\n===Heraldry===\n[[File:Blason Raon aux bois.svg|thumb|upright|Arms of [[Raon-aux-Bois]], France]]\n\nDeer of various types appear frequently in European [[heraldry]]. In the British armory, the term \"stag\" is typically used to refer to antlered male red deer, while \"buck\" indicates an antlered male fallow deer. Stags and bucks appear in a number of [[Attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]], referred to as \"lodged\" when the deer is lying down, \"trippant\" when it has one leg raised, \"courant\" when it is running, \"springing\" when in the act of leaping, \"statant\" when it is standing with all hooves on the ground and looking ahead, and \"at gaze\" when otherwise statant but looking at the viewer. Stags' heads are also frequently used; these are typically portrayed without an attached neck and as facing the viewer, in which case they are termed \"caboshed\".<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Arthur Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', T.C. and E.C.

A deer appears on the arms of the [[Israel Postal Company|Israeli Postal Authority]]. Coats of arms featuring deer include those of [[Dotternhausen]], [[Thierachern]], [[Friolzheim]], [[Bauen]], [[Albstadt]], and [[Dassel]] in Germany; of the [[Earls Bathurst]] in England; of [[Balakhna]], Russia; of [[\u00c5land]], Finland; of [[Gjemnes]], [[Hitra]], [[Hjartdal]], [[Rendalen]] and [[Voss]] in Norway; of [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], Poland; of [[Ume\u00e5]], Sweden; of [[Queensland]], Australia; of [[Cervera]], Catalonia; of [[Northern Ireland]]; and of [[Chile]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOther types of deer used in heraldry include the hind, portrayed much like the stag or buck but without antlers, as well as the reindeer and winged stags. Winged stags are used as [[supporter]]s in the arms of the [[de Carteret family]]. The sea-stag, possessing the antlers, head, forelegs and upper body of a stag and the tail of a [[mermaid]], is often found in German heraldry.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===Economic significance===\nDeer have long had economic significance to humans.

In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters killed approximately 489,922 white-tailed deer to procure venison, control the deer population, and minimize the spread of disease. These hunters purchased more than 1.5&nbsp;million deer harvest tags. The economic value of [[deer hunting]] to Michigan's economy is substantial. For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507&nbsp;million hunting white-tailed deer in Michigan.<ref name=\"O'Brien et al., 2011\"/>\n\nDeer hunting is a popular activity in the U.S. that provides the hunter's family with high quality meat and generates revenue for states and the federal government from the sales of licenses, permits and tags. The 2006 survey by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] estimates that license sales generate approximately $700&nbsp;million annually. This revenue generally goes to support conservation efforts in the states where the licenses are purchased.

The two main groups of deer are the [[Cervinae]], including the [[muntjac]], the [[elk]] (wapiti), the [[fallow deer]], and the [[chital]]; and the [[Capreolinae]], including the [[reindeer]] (caribou), the [[roe deer]], and the [[moose]]. Female reindeer, and male deer of all species except the Chinese [[water deer]], grow and shed new [[antler]]s each year. In this they differ from permanently [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]ed [[antelope]], which are part of a different family ([[Bovidae]]) within the same order of [[even-toed ungulates]] (Artiodactyla).\n\nThe [[musk deer]] ([[Moschidae]]) of Asia and [[chevrotain]]s ([[Chevrotain|Tragulidae]]) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families within the ruminant clade ([[Ruminantia]]). They are no more closely related to deer than are other even-toed ungulates.\n\nDeer appear in art from [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s onwards, and they have [[deer in mythology|played a role in mythology]], religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in [[heraldry]]. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as [[venison]], their skins as soft, strong [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]], and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer [[hunting]] has been a popular activity since at least the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{anchor|doe}}\n[[File:Chital (8458215435).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chital]] deer in [[Nagarhole National Park|Nagarahole]], India]]\n\nDeer live in a variety of [[biome]]s, ranging from [[tundra]] to the [[tropical rainforest]]. While often associated with forests, many deer are [[ecotone]] species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the [[understory]] and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.\n\nDeer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the [[Barbary stag]], a subspecies of [[red deer]] that is confined to the [[Atlas Mountains]] in the northwest of the continent, an additional extinct species of giant deer ''[[Megaceroides|Megaceroides algericus]]'' was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago. [[Fallow deer]] have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of [[brocket deer]] and [[pud\u00fa]]s of Central and South America, and [[muntjac]]s of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the [[Indian muntjac]]. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the [[Reindeer|caribou]] that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and [[moose]] that inhabit [[taiga]] and adjacent areas. Huemul deer ([[taruca]] and [[South Andean deer|Chilean huemul]]) of South America's [[Andes]] fill the ecological niches of the [[ibex]] and [[wild goat]], with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the [[Canadian Rocky Mountains|Canadian Rocky Mountain]] and [[Columbia Mountains|Columbia Mountain]] regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species ([[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], caribou, [[elk]], and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]], [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], [[Yoho National Park]], and [[Kootenay National Park]] on the British Columbia side, and [[Banff National Park]], [[Jasper National Park]], and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]] on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and [[alpine tundra]] areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent [[Great Plains]] grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, [[American bison]], and [[pronghorn]] antelope.\n\n[[File:Reindeer-on-the-rocks.jpg|thumb|[[Reindeer]] herds, standing on snow to avoid flies]]\n\nThe [[Eurasia]]n Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower diversity in plant and animal species. However, many national parks and protected reserves in Europe do have populations of red deer, [[roe deer]], and fallow deer. These species have long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and Northwestern [[Iran]]. \"European\" fallow deer historically lived over much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day [[Turkey]].\n\nPresent-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct [[tarpan]] (forest horse), extinct [[aurochs]] (forest ox), and the endangered [[wisent]] (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the [[Scottish Highlands]], the Austrian [[Alps]], the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and some fine National Parks, including [[Do\u00f1ana National Park]] in Spain, the [[Veluwe]] in the Netherlands, the [[Ardennes]] in Belgium, and [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|Bia\u0142owie\u017ca National Park]] of Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, [[Eurasian lynx]], [[Iberian lynx]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], and [[brown bear]]s.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea, Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find [[Siberian roe deer]], [[sika deer]], elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the Sino-Russian border.\n\nDeer such as the sika deer, [[Thorold's deer]], [[Central Asian red deer]], and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by [[Han Chinese]], [[Turkic peoples]], [[Tungusic peoples]], [[Mongolia]]ns, and [[Koreans]]. Like the [[Sami people]] of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India's Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal's Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas that are home to [[chital]], [[hog deer]], [[barasingha]], Indian [[Sambar deer|sambar]], and [[Indian muntjac]]. Grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which [[Kanha National Park]], [[Dudhwa National Park]], and [[Chitwan National Park]] are most famous. Sri Lanka's [[Wilpattu National Park]] and [[Yala National Park]] have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.\n\nThe Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct [[Schomburgk's deer]], [[Eld's deer]], Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld's deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as [[Khao Yai National Park|Khao Yai]]. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other [[herbivory|herbivores]], such as [[Asian elephant]]s, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as [[nilgai]], [[four-horned antelope]], [[blackbuck]], and [[Chinkara|Indian gazelle]] in India), and wild oxen (such as [[wild Asian water buffalo]], [[gaur]], [[banteng]], and [[kouprey]]). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be some overlap.\n\nAustralia has six [[introduced species]] of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from [[acclimatisation society]] releases in the 19th century. These are the fallow deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, [[Javan rusa|rusa]], and chital. Red deer introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock were domesticated in [[deer farm]]s by the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.<ref name=\"DeerInNewZealand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/mammals-introduced/page-10|title=Deer|website=Te Ara: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|year=1966|editor-first=A.

They have small, unspecialized stomachs by [[ruminant]] standards, and high nutrition requirements. Rather than eating and digesting vast quantities of low-grade fibrous food as, for example, [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[cattle]] do, deer select easily digestible shoots, young leaves, fresh grasses, soft twigs, fruit, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[lichen]]s. The low-fibered food, after minimal fermentation and shredding, passes rapidly through the alimentary canal. The deer require a large amount of minerals such as [[calcium]] and phosphate in order to support antler growth, and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich diet. There are, however, some reports of deer engaging in carnivorous activity, such as depredating the nests of [[Northern bobwhite]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis-Felege | first1 = S.

A doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets, while not unknown, are uncommon). Mating season typically begins in later August and lasts until December. Some species mate until early March. The [[gestation period]] is anywhere up to ten months for the European roe deer. Most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots, though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter. In the first twenty minutes of a fawn's life, the fawn begins to take its first steps. Its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent, so [[predator]]s will not find it. Its mother leaves often to graze, and the fawn does not like to be left behind. Sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">[http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/mammals/deer.htm Deer \u2013 info and games] Sheppard Software.</ref> The fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother. The fawn and its mother stay together for about one year. A male usually leaves and never sees his mother again, but females sometimes come back with their own fawns and form small herds.\n\n===Disease===\nIn some areas of the UK, deer (especially [[fallow deer]] due to their [[gregarious behaviour]]), have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of [[bovine tuberculosis]],<ref name=\"Delahay et al., 2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Delahay |first1=R.

Studies in the late 20th century suggested a similar bifurcation in the family. This as well as previous studies support [[monophyly]] in Cervinae, while Capreolinae appears [[paraphyletic]]. The 2006 study identified two lineages in Cervinae, Cervini (comprising the genera ''[[Axis (genus)|Axis]]'', ''[[Cervus]]'', ''[[Dama (deer)|Dama]]'' and ''[[Rucervus]]'') and Muntiacini (''[[Muntiacus]]'' and ''[[Elaphodus]]'').

The name was popularised in the 18th century by [[James Macpherson]], creator of 'Ossianic poetry'.\n\n===In literature===\nDeer have been an integral part of fables and other literary works since the inception of writing. Stags were used as symbols in the latter Sumerian writings. For instance, the boat of Sumerian god Enki is named the ''Stag of Azbu''. There are several mentions of the animal in the [[Rigveda]] as well as the [[Bible]]. In the Indian epic [[Ramayana]], [[Sita]] is lured by a golden deer which [[Rama]] tries to catch. In the absence of both Rama and [[Lakshman]], [[Ravana]] kidnaps Sita. Many of the allegorical [[Aesop's fables]], such as \"The Stag at the Pool\", \"The One-Eyed Doe\" and \"The Stag and a Lion\", personify deer to give moral lessons. For instance, \"The Sick Stag\" gives the message that uncaring friends can do more harm than good.<ref name=guide/> The [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a pascola [from the Spanish 'pascua', Easter] dancer (also known as a deer dancer).

The next year, the baron encounters a stag with a [[cherry tree]] growing from its head; presumably this is the animal he had shot at the previous year.

In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1950 fantasy novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' the adult Pevensies, now kings and queens of [[Narnia]], chase the White Stag on a hunt, as the Stag is said to grant its captor a wish. The hunt is key in returning the Pevensies to their home in England. In the 1979 book ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (book)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]'', The Great White Stag is the leader of all the animals.\n\n===Heraldry===\n[[File:Blason Raon aux bois.svg|thumb|upright|Arms of [[Raon-aux-Bois]], France]]\n\nDeer of various types appear frequently in European [[heraldry]]. In the British armory, the term \"stag\" is typically used to refer to antlered male red deer, while \"buck\" indicates an antlered male fallow deer. Stags and bucks appear in a number of [[Attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]], referred to as \"lodged\" when the deer is lying down, \"trippant\" when it has one leg raised, \"courant\" when it is running, \"springing\" when in the act of leaping, \"statant\" when it is standing with all hooves on the ground and looking ahead, and \"at gaze\" when otherwise statant but looking at the viewer. Stags' heads are also frequently used; these are typically portrayed without an attached neck and as facing the viewer, in which case they are termed \"caboshed\".<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Arthur Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, 208-210, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft.</ref>\n\nExamples of deer in [[coats of arms]] can be found in the arms of [[Hertfordshire]], England, and its county town of [[Hertford]]; both are examples of [[canting arms]]. A deer appears on the arms of the [[Israel Postal Company|Israeli Postal Authority]]. Coats of arms featuring deer include those of [[Dotternhausen]], [[Thierachern]], [[Friolzheim]], [[Bauen]], [[Albstadt]], and [[Dassel]] in Germany; of the [[Earls Bathurst]] in England; of [[Balakhna]], Russia; of [[\u00c5land]], Finland; of [[Gjemnes]], [[Hitra]], [[Hjartdal]], [[Rendalen]] and [[Voss]] in Norway; of [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], Poland; of [[Ume\u00e5]], Sweden; of [[Queensland]], Australia; of [[Cervera]], Catalonia; of [[Northern Ireland]]; and of [[Chile]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOther types of deer used in heraldry include the hind, portrayed much like the stag or buck but without antlers, as well as the reindeer and winged stags. Winged stags are used as [[supporter]]s in the arms of the [[de Carteret family]]. The sea-stag, possessing the antlers, head, forelegs and upper body of a stag and the tail of a [[mermaid]], is often found in German heraldry.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===Economic significance===\nDeer have long had economic significance to humans.

In the United States, it is produced in small amounts compared to beef but still represents a significant trade. By 2012, some 25,000 tons of red deer were raised on farms in North America. The major deer-producing countries are New Zealand, the market leader, with Ireland, Great Britain and Germany.

There is nothing special about skins with the fur on since the hair is brittle and soon falls off. The hoofs and horns are used for ornamental purposes, especially the antlers of the [[roe deer]], which are utilized for making umbrella handles, and for similar purposes; elk horn is often employed in making knife handles. In China, a medicine is made from stag horn, and the antlers of certain species are eaten when \"in the velvet\".<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Deer}}</ref> Among the [[Inuit]], the traditional ''[[ulu]]'' women's knife was made with an antler, horn, or ivory handle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inuit Bering Sea Eskimo Walrus Ivory and Iron Semi-Lunar Knife 'Ulu' (1800 to 1900 Inuit)|url=http://www.finch-and-co.co.uk/antiquities/d/inuit-bering-sea-eskimo-walrus-ivory-and-iron-semi-lunar-knife-ulu/51906|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mavrogheni trasura cerbi.jpg|thumb|[[Nicholas Mavrogenes]], [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] of [[Wallachia]], riding through [[Bucharest]] in a stag\u2212drawn carriage.

In the U.S., about 1.5&nbsp;million deer-vehicle collisions occur each year, according to the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]].

In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters killed approximately 489,922 white-tailed deer to procure venison, control the deer population, and minimize the spread of disease. These hunters purchased more than 1.5&nbsp;million deer harvest tags. The economic value of [[deer hunting]] to Michigan's economy is substantial. For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507&nbsp;million hunting white-tailed deer in Michigan.<ref name=\"O'Brien et al., 2011\"/>\n\nDeer hunting is a popular activity in the U.S. that provides the hunter's family with high quality meat and generates revenue for states and the federal government from the sales of licenses, permits and tags. The 2006 survey by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] estimates that license sales generate approximately $700&nbsp;million annually. This revenue generally goes to support conservation efforts in the states where the licenses are purchased. Overall, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that big game hunting for deer and elk generates approximately $11.8&nbsp;billion annually in hunting-related travel, equipment and related expenditures.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{cite web|url=http://library.fws.gov/pubs/nat_survey2006_final.pdf |title=U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau. 2006 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation |date= |accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''deer'' was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. [[Old English]] ''d\u0113or'' and [[Middle English]] ''der'' meant a wild animal of any kind. <!--In Shakespeare's time, \"small deer\" meant any type of petty game, not worth pursuing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Small+deer |title=Small deer |accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> in contrast to ''[[cattle]]'', which then meant any sort of domestic livestock that could be removed from the land, related to personal-property ownership, as with modern ''[[chattel]]'' (property) and [[financial capital| financial ''capital'']]. Wild animals in a forest were considered part of [[real estate]], and sold with the land.--> Cognates of Old English ''d\u0113or'' in other dead [[Germanic languages]] have the general sense of ''animal'', such as [[Old High German]] ''tior'', [[Old Norse]] ''djur'' or ''d\u0233r'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''dius'', [[Old Saxon]] ''dier'', and [[Old Frisian]] ''diar''.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/D0087500.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325232020/http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/D0087500.html |archivedate=25 March 2004 |chapter=deer|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |year=2000}}</ref> This general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500. However, all modern Germanic languages save English and Scots retain the more general sense: for example, German ''Tier'' and Norwegian ''dyr'' mean ''animal''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=Deer |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=deer |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Hirschjagd des Kurf\u00fcrsten Friedrich des Weisen (Kunsthistorisches Museum).jpg|thumb|\"The Stag Hunt of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]]\" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1529]]\n\nFor many types of deer in modern English usage, the male is a ''buck'' and the female a ''doe'', but the terms vary with dialect, and according to the size of the species. The male [[red deer]] is a ''stag'', while for other large species the male is a ''bull'', the female a ''cow'', as in cattle. In older usage, the male of any species is a ''[[Hart (deer)|hart]]'', especially if over five years old, and the female is a ''hind'', especially if three or more years old.<ref>[[OED]], s.v. ''hart'' and ''hind''</ref> The young of small species is a ''fawn'' and of large species a ''[[calf (animal)|calf]]''; a very small young may be a ''kid''.
