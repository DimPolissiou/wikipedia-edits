This is called [[merciful anosmia]].\n* Patients usually complain of nasal obstruction despite the roomy nasal cavity, which can be caused either by the obstruction produced by the discharge in the nose, or as a result of sensory loss due to atrophy of nerves in the nose, so the patient is unaware of the air flow.  In the case of the second cause, the sensation of obstruction is subjective. \n* Bleeding from the nose, also called epistaxis, may occur when the dried discharge (crusts) are removed. \n* Septal perforation and dermatitis of [[nasal vestibule]] can occur. The nose may show a saddle-nose deformity. \n* Atrophic rhinitis is also associated with similar atrophic changes in the [[pharynx]] or [[larynx]], producing symptoms pertaining to these structures. Hearing impairment can occur due to [[Eustachian tube]] blockage causing [[middle ear]] effusion.\n\nPermanent loss of smell and impairment of taste may also be a result of this disease, even after the symptoms are cured.\n\n== Etiology ==\nCauses can be remembered by the mnemonic '''HERNIA''':\n* [[Heredity|Hereditary]] factors: the disease runs in  families\n* [[Endocrine]] imbalance: the disease tends to start at puberty and mostly involves females\n* [[Racial]] factors: white people are more susceptible than natives of equatorial Africa \n* [[Nutrition]]al deficiency: vitamins A or D, or iron{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n* [[Infection]]: ''[[Klebsiella]] ozaenae'', [[Corynebacterium|diphtheroids]], ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]'', [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], etc.\n* [[Autoimmune]] factors: viral infection or some other unidentified insult may trigger antigenicity of the nasal mucosa.\n\n===Secondary atrophic rhinitis===\nSpecific infections, such as [[syphilis]], [[leprosy]] and [[rhinoscleroma]], may cause destruction of the nasal structures leading to atrophic changes.

This is called [[merciful anosmia]].\n* Patients usually complain of nasal obstruction despite the roomy nasal cavity, which can be caused either by the obstruction produced by the discharge in the nose, or as a result of sensory loss due to atrophy of nerves in the nose, so the patient is unaware of the air flow.  In the case of the second cause, the sensation of obstruction is subjective. \n* Bleeding from the nose, also called epistaxis, may occur when the dried discharge (crusts) are removed. \n* Septal perforation and dermatitis of [[nasal vestibule]] can occur. The nose may show a saddle-nose deformity. \n* Atrophic rhinitis is also associated with similar atrophic changes in the [[pharynx]] or [[larynx]], producing symptoms pertaining to these structures. Hearing impairment can occur due to [[Eustachian tube]] blockage causing [[middle ear]] effusion.\n\nPermanent loss of smell and impairment of taste may also be a result of this disease, even after the symptoms are cured.\n\n== Etiology ==\nCauses can be remembered by the mnemonic '''HERNIA''':\n* [[Heredity|Hereditary]] factors: the disease runs in  families\n* [[Endocrine]] imbalance: the disease tends to start at puberty and mostly involves females\n* [[Racial]] factors: white people are more susceptible than natives of equatorial Africa \n* [[Nutrition]]al deficiency: vitamins A or D, or iron{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n* [[Infection]]: ''[[Klebsiella]] ozaenae'', [[Corynebacterium|diphtheroids]], ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]'', [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], etc.\n* [[Autoimmune]] factors: viral infection or some other unidentified insult may trigger antigenicity of the nasal mucosa.\n\n===Secondary atrophic rhinitis===\nSpecific infections, such as [[syphilis]], [[leprosy]] and [[rhinoscleroma]], may cause destruction of the nasal structures leading to atrophic changes. Atrophic rhinitis can also result from long-standing purulent [[sinusitis]] or [[radiotherapy]] of the nose, or as a complication of surgery of the [[turbinates]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=deShazo|first=Richard D.|last2=Stringer|first2=Scott P.|date=2011-02-01|title=Atrophic rhinosinusitis: progress toward explanation of an unsolved medical mystery|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328342333e|issn=1473-6322|pmid=21157302}}</ref> The United Kingdom [[National Health Service]] has stated that \"Most cases of atrophic rhinitis in the UK occur when the turbinates are damaged or removed during surgery\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rhinitis---non-allergic/Pages/Causes.aspx|title=Non-allergic rhinitis - Causes - NHS Choices|last=Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref> Some authors refer to as Atrophic rhinitis secondary to sinus surgery as the [[empty nose syndrome]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Unilateral atrophic rhinitis===\nExtreme deviation of nasal septum may be accompanied by atrophic rhinitis on the wider side.\n\n==Pathology==\n* The ciliated columnar epithelium of the nasal mucosa is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. \n* Atrophy of mucosa, turbinal bones and seromucinous glands tends to occur, due to obliterative endarteritis and periarteritis causing decreased blood supply, hence the supplying area atrophies.<ref name=\"Gleeson\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MuRyCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1465&lpg=PA1465&dq=chronic+atrophic+rhinitis+scott+brown's+otorhinolaryngology&source=bl&ots=Xo46YWkVot&sig=ACfU3U2AVu8rOZwgwk_SRTSIiMh4pDsWrQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiM-cWR2ozlAhWJwI8KHaicDZcQ6AEwEHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=chronic%20atrophic%20rhinitis%20scott%20brown's%20otorhinolaryngology&f=false|title=Scott-Brown's Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery 7Ed: 3 volume set|last=Gleeson|first=Michael|last2=Clarke|first2=Ray|date=2008-04-25|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781444109832|language=en}}</ref>\n* Arrested development of paranasal sinuses.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is based on clinical history and examination.

National Railway]] (CNR) line, and several roads, in [[Greater Vancouver|Metro Vancouver]].\n\n==History==\n===Infrastructure===\nThe 1929 Vancouver Major Streets Plan designated the Clark-Knight corridor as a six-lane [[arterial road]]. The upgrade delayed for decades, Knight St. was never a streetcar route, and experienced less commercial and lower intensity development than nearby arterials.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://council.vancouver.ca/20030410/cs2.htm |title=Clark-Knight Corridor Whole Route Analysis |year=2003 |website=www.vancouver.ca}}</ref> A late 1950s metropolitan highway planning committee recommendation included a proposed 1970s crossing in the vicinity, to relieve the [[Oak Street Bridge]].{{sfn|Levesque|1974|p=6}}\n\nConstructed 1969\u20131974, the structure was the second [[Cast in place concrete|cast-in-place]] segmental [[cantilever bridge]] built in North America, the first being Quebec in 1964. For many years, the {{convert|109.7|m|ft|adj=on|0}} main span held the world record for this design.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/knight-street-bridge-vancouver-bc-don-singer |title=Knight Street Bridge|website=www.linkedin.com}}</ref>\nEach drop-in span, which joins the two separate parallel cantilever spans from the main piers, is an arched [[Prestressed concrete#Bridges|post-tensioned concrete]] girder, resting on rubber bearings at each end.<ref name=MIR>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/marine/2000/m00w0005/m00w0005.html |title=Marine Investigation Report M00W0005 |year=2000 |website=www.tsb.gc.ca}}</ref> Like the street, the bridge was named after Robert Knight, a property owner in South Vancouver in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Walker\">{{Cite book| last=Walker | first=Elizabeth | p=67  | title=Street Names of Vancouver | publisher=Vancouver Historical Society | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-9692378-7-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the planning stage, the project was known as the '''[[Fraser Street Bridge (1894)|Fraser Street Bridge]] Replacement'''. At the official opening ceremony in January 1974, [[Graham Lea]], provincial Minister of Highways, cut the ribbon. On hand were Gil Blair, mayor of Richmond, and [[Art Phillips]], mayor of Vancouver.{{sfn|Dawe|1996|pp=53\u201354}} Totalling about $15M, including $3M for roadways, the province funded the scheme.{{sfn|Dawe|1996|p=55}} On formation in 1999, [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] assumed ownership and maintenance responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://buzzer.translink.ca/2016/05/translink-commits-more-than-48-million-to-road-and-cycling-projects | title=Buzzer blog, 17 May 2016 |publisher=TransLink | website=www.translink.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe configuration comprises an overpass of Marine Drive, the {{convert|238|m|ft|adj=on}} Knight Street Bridge North, and the {{convert|1198|m|ft|adj=on}} Knight Street Bridge South. The six-lane medium-level bridge reduces to four lanes over [[Mitchell Island]], the outside lanes becoming the off and on ramps for the island. The electrically heated deck minimizes winter de-icing.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1974.htm |title=Vancouver history |year=1974 |website=www.vancouverhistory.ca}}</ref> On the underside of the deck, the western spans carry a maintenance walkway, above which are a water pipe, gas pipe, and electrical lines. The navigational clearance is {{convert|19|-|23|m|ft}} at the apex, depending upon the tide.<ref name=\" MIR\" />\n\nUpgrading Knight St., and eliminating the load weight restrictions associated with the previous structure, this [[Vancouver]]\u2013[[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] link eased congestion,{{sfn|Levesque|1974|p=4}} and connected to [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]], and since 1989, [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]]. Averaging over 100,000 vehicle crossings daily, the bridge is the second busiest in the Lower Mainland.<ref name=TMP>{{Cite web | url=https://www.translink.ca/Plans-and-Projects/TransLink-Maintenance-and-Repair-Program/Bridge-Projects.aspx |title=TransLink maintenance program |website=www.translink.ca }}</ref> Cyclists are legally required to ride on the sidewalks.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.richmond.ca/services/ttp/cycling/cycling_maps.htm | title=Cycling: Bridge Crossings | website=www.richmond.ca}}</ref>\n\n===Maintenance, upgrades and incidents===\nOn January 15, 2000 the boom of a mobile crane transported on a barge named ''T.L. Sharpe'', towed by the ''Sea Cap XII'', struck the underside of the Knight Street Bridge at 1:45 PM, damaging the bridge and the fixtures secured underneath its deck. The impact caused the boom to bend and the crane to slide off the barge and sink, and the bridge was closed to traffic for about 48 hours.<ref name=\" MIR\" /> Water supply to Mitchell Island via the bridge was shut down for 25 days, and an emergency bypass water supply from Vancouver was installed.<ref name=\"watermain\">{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/061200_item251214.pdf |title=City of Richmond: Report to Committee re: Knight Street Bridge Watermain |website=www.richmond.ca}}</ref> The incident prompted the City of Richmond to install a second water main to Mitchell Island in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/Annual_Report_20025953.pdf#page=16 | p=7 |title=City of Richmond: 2002 Annual Report|website=www.richmond.ca}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Knight Street Bridge and Fraser River, Richmond - panoramio.jpg |thumb|left|350px| Knight Street Bridge, northward. Richmond in foreground]]\n\nIn 2011, the bridge underwent a [[seismic retrofit]] of three abutments, which were vulnerable to settlement or collapse from movements during [[soil liquefaction]]. The subsurface conditions comprise dense till-like soils for the north bridge, but potentially liquefiable deltaic sediments for the south bridge. The north abutments and piers rest upon spread footings, whereas the south ones rest upon timber and steel-pipe piles. To densify the ground, 105 injection boreholes were drilled to a depth of {{convert|12.3|m|ft}} around one abutment, and filled at pressure with a low mobility grout up to the surface. Timber compaction piles were used for densification in other areas. Steel-pipe piles were installed at a pier adjacent to the riverbank.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.klohn.com/rd/technical-papers/geotechnical-aspects-of-the-seismic-safety-assessment-and-retrofit-of-the-knight-street-bridge-2 |title=Seismic Assessment and Retrofit of the Knight Street Bridge |website=www.klohn.com}}; <br /> {{Cite web | url=https://www.klohn.com/rd/technical-papers/geotechnical-seismic-retrofit-of-the-knight-street-bridge-in-metro-vancouver |title=Seismic Retrofit of the Knight Street Bridge |website=www.klohn.com}}; <br /> {{Cite web | url=https://www.southwestcontracting.ca/projects/knight-street-bridge |title=Seismic Retrofit of the Knight Street Bridge |website=www.southwestcontracting.ca}}</ref>\n\nRanking first in Vancouver, the bridge was the scene of more than 2,500 car accidents during 2013\u20132017, of which nearly half resulted in injuries or fatalities.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.callkleinlawyers.com/full-disclosure/top-5-most-dangerous-intersections-in-vancouver-b-c |title=Top 5 most dangerous intersections in Vancouver, B.C. |website=www.callkleinlawyers.com}}</ref> The Marine Dr. on and off ramps have rated among Canada's most dangerous intersections.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.https://miss604.com/2013/01/vancouver-history-knight-street-bridge.html |title=Vancouver history, Knight Street Bridge |website=www.miss604.com}}; <br /> {{Cite web | url=https://www.markhammitsubishi.ca/en/news/view/most-dangerous-intersections-in-canada/62936 |title=Canada's most dangerous intersections |website=www.markhammitsubishi.ca}}</ref> In 2017, the city made design and signalling changes to enhance safety, which included a new turn bay for westbound vehicles on SE Marine Dr. turning north, and a new shared walking and cycling path.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.straight.com/news/939736/city-launches-upgrades-high-collision-location-knight-street-and-southeast-marine-drive |title=The Georgia Straight, 21 Jul 2017 |website=www.straight.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring early 2020, the bridge underwent extensive rehabilitation that required overnight single lane closures in each direction. The work included lighting upgrades, pier repairs, and the replacement of [[impact attenuator|crash cushion]]s, signage, and bearing and expansion joints.<ref name=\" TMP\" />\n\n===Land developments===\nFormerly, transport planning had not been coordinated with land use planning.

It is caused by a [[mutation]] in the ''HGD'' [[gene]] for the [[enzyme]] [[homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase]] ({{EC number|1.13.11.5}}); if a person inherits an abnormal copy from both parents (it is a [[dominance relationship|recessive condition]]), the body accumulates an intermediate substance called [[homogentisic acid]] in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its [[oxide|oxidized form]] ''alkapton'' are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to [[cartilage]] ([[ochronosis]], leading to [[osteoarthritis]]) and [[heart valve]]s, as well as precipitating as [[kidney stone]]s and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over 30 years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.\n\nApart from treatment of the complications (such as [[analgesia|pain relief]] and [[Arthroplasty|joint replacement]] for the cartilage damage), the drug [[nitisinone]] has been found to suppress homogentisic acid production, and research is ongoing as to whether it can improve symptoms.

Different mutations may affect the structure, function, or solubility of the enzyme.<ref name=Zatkova2011/> Very occasionally, the disease appears to be transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion, where a single abnormal copy of ''HGD'' from a single parent is associated with alkaptonuria;  other mechanisms or defects in other genes possibly are responsible in those cases.<ref name=Zatkova2011/>\n\n[[File:Inborn errors of metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine.svg|800px|centre|thumb|Pathophysiology of alkaptonuria (AKU) is due to the absence of functional homogentisate dioxygenase (HGD) in the liver.]]\nThe HGD enzyme is involved in the metabolism (chemical processing) of the [[aromatic amino acids]] [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Normally, these enter the bloodstream through protein-containing food and the natural turnover of protein in the body. Tyrosine is specifically required for a number of functions, such as [[hormone]]s (e.g. [[thyroxine]], the thyroid hormone), [[melanin]] (the dark pigment in the skin and hair), and certain proteins, but the vast majority (over 95%) is unused and is metabolized through a [[Tyrosine#Degradation|group of enzymes]] that eventually generate [[acetoacetate]] and [[malate]].<ref name=Ranganath/> In alkaptonuria, the HGD enzyme cannot metabolize the homogentisic acid (generated from tyrosine) into [[4-maleylacetoacetate]], and homogentisic acid levels in the blood are 100-fold higher than would normally be expected, despite the fact that a substantial amount is eliminated into the urine by the kidneys.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\nThe homogentisic acid is converted to the related substance benzoquinone acetic acid  which forms [[polymer]]s that resemble the skin pigment melanin. These are deposited in the [[collagen]], a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks [[ochre]]); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Alkaptonuria.jpg|thumb|right|Urine of a 4-month-old baby with dark urine (on the left) after 10% ammonia and 3% silver nitrate were added.

This  assigns scores to the presence of particular symptoms and features, such as the presence of eye and skin pigmentation, joint pain, heart problems, and organ stones.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Treatment==\nNo treatment modality has been unequivocally demonstrated to reduce the complications of alkaptonuria. Main treatment attempts have focused on preventing ochronosis through the reduction of accumulating homogentisic acid.  Such commonly recommended treatments include large doses of [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) or dietary restriction of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. However, vitamin C treatment has not shown to be effective,<ref name=Ranganath/> and protein restriction (which can be difficult to adhere to) has not shown to be effective in clinical studies.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that the herbicide [[nitisinone]] may be effective in the treatment of alkaptonuria. Nitisinone inhibits the enzyme [[4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]], responsible for converting tyrosine to homogentisic acid, thereby blocking the production and accumulation of HGA. Nitisinone has been used for some time at much higher doses in the treatment of [[type I tyrosinemia]]. Nitisinone treatment has been shown to cause a larger than 95% reduction in plasma and urinary HGA.<ref name=Ranganath/>  The main drawback is accumulation of tyrosine, the long-term risks of which are unknown; a particular concern exists about damage to the [[cornea]] of the eye. Long-term use requires frequent monitoring for complications.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nAlkaptonuria does not appear to affect life expectancy, although the last study on the topic is from 1985.<ref name=Ranganath/> The main impact is on quality of life; many people with alkaptonuria have disabling symptoms such as pain, poor sleep, and breathing symptoms.

Joint-replacement surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age.<ref name=Ranganath/> In the longer term, the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing.<ref name=Ranganath/> [[Bone mineral density]] may be affected, increasing the risk of [[bone fracture]]s, and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n[[Valvular heart disease]], mainly calcification and regurgitation of the [[aortic valve|aortic]] and [[mitral valve]]s, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases, [[valve replacement]] may be necessary. [[Cardiac arrhythmia|Irregularities in the heart rhythm]] and [[heart failure]] affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria (40% and 10%, respectively).<ref name=Ranganath/> Hearing loss affects 40% of people. Also, a propensity to developing [[kidney stone]]s exists, and eventually also [[gallstone]]s and stones in the [[prostate]] and [[salivary gland]]s ([[sialolithiasis]]) can occur.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[File:Homogentisic acid.svg|thumb|right|Chemical [[skeletal formula]] of homogentisic acid, which accumulates in the body fluids of people with alkaptonuria.]]\nAll people carry in their DNA two copies (one received from each parent) of the gene ''HGD'', which contains the genetic information to produce the enzyme [[homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase]] (HGD) which can normally be found in numerous tissues in the body (liver, kidney, small intestine, colon, and prostate). In people with alkaptonuria, both copies of the gene contain abnormalities that mean that the body cannot produce an adequately functioning enzyme.<ref name=Zatkova2011>{{cite journal |author =Zatkova A |title=An update on molecular genetics of Alkaptonuria (AKU) |journal=J.

Different mutations may affect the structure, function, or solubility of the enzyme.<ref name=Zatkova2011/> Very occasionally, the disease appears to be transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion, where a single abnormal copy of ''HGD'' from a single parent is associated with alkaptonuria;  other mechanisms or defects in other genes possibly are responsible in those cases.<ref name=Zatkova2011/>\n\n[[File:Inborn errors of metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine.svg|800px|centre|thumb|Pathophysiology of alkaptonuria (AKU) is due to the absence of functional homogentisate dioxygenase (HGD) in the liver.]]\nThe HGD enzyme is involved in the metabolism (chemical processing) of the [[aromatic amino acids]] [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Normally, these enter the bloodstream through protein-containing food and the natural turnover of protein in the body. Tyrosine is specifically required for a number of functions, such as [[hormone]]s (e.g. [[thyroxine]], the thyroid hormone), [[melanin]] (the dark pigment in the skin and hair), and certain proteins, but the vast majority (over 95%) is unused and is metabolized through a [[Tyrosine#Degradation|group of enzymes]] that eventually generate [[acetoacetate]] and [[malate]].<ref name=Ranganath/> In alkaptonuria, the HGD enzyme cannot metabolize the homogentisic acid (generated from tyrosine) into [[4-maleylacetoacetate]], and homogentisic acid levels in the blood are 100-fold higher than would normally be expected, despite the fact that a substantial amount is eliminated into the urine by the kidneys.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\nThe homogentisic acid is converted to the related substance benzoquinone acetic acid  which forms [[polymer]]s that resemble the skin pigment melanin. These are deposited in the [[collagen]], a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks [[ochre]]); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Alkaptonuria.jpg|thumb|right|Urine of a 4-month-old baby with dark urine (on the left) after 10% ammonia and 3% silver nitrate were added. The tube in the middle is a normal control. Color change on alkalinization is not a specific test, and confirmatory investigations are needed.<ref name=Ranganath/>]]\n\nIf the diagnosis of alkaptonuria is suspected, it can be confirmed or excluded by collecting urine for 24 hours and determining the amount of homogentisic acid by means of [[chromatography]]. No assay of HGA in blood has been validated.<ref name=Ranganath/> The Genetic Testing Registry  is used for maintaining information about the genetic test for alkaptonuria.<ref>{{cite web|author=Anonymous | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5775/alkaptonuria|date=18 March 2016| accessdate=17 April 2018 | title=Alkaptonuria}}</ref>\n\nThe severity of the symptoms and response to treatment can be quantified through a validated questionnaire titled the AKU Severity Score Index. This  assigns scores to the presence of particular symptoms and features, such as the presence of eye and skin pigmentation, joint pain, heart problems, and organ stones.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Treatment==\nNo treatment modality has been unequivocally demonstrated to reduce the complications of alkaptonuria. Main treatment attempts have focused on preventing ochronosis through the reduction of accumulating homogentisic acid.  Such commonly recommended treatments include large doses of [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) or dietary restriction of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. However, vitamin C treatment has not shown to be effective,<ref name=Ranganath/> and protein restriction (which can be difficult to adhere to) has not shown to be effective in clinical studies.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that the herbicide [[nitisinone]] may be effective in the treatment of alkaptonuria. Nitisinone inhibits the enzyme [[4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]], responsible for converting tyrosine to homogentisic acid, thereby blocking the production and accumulation of HGA. Nitisinone has been used for some time at much higher doses in the treatment of [[type I tyrosinemia]]. Nitisinone treatment has been shown to cause a larger than 95% reduction in plasma and urinary HGA.<ref name=Ranganath/>  The main drawback is accumulation of tyrosine, the long-term risks of which are unknown; a particular concern exists about damage to the [[cornea]] of the eye. Long-term use requires frequent monitoring for complications.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nAlkaptonuria does not appear to affect life expectancy, although the last study on the topic is from 1985.<ref name=Ranganath/> The main impact is on quality of life; many people with alkaptonuria have disabling symptoms such as pain, poor sleep, and breathing symptoms. These generally start in the fourth decade. The typical age at requiring joint replacement surgery is 50\u201355 years.<ref name=Ranganath/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nIn most ethnic groups, the prevalence of alkaptonuria is between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000.<ref name=Zatkova2011/> In Slovakia and the Dominican Republic, the disease is much more common, with prevalence estimated at 1:19,000 people.<ref name=Zatkova2011/> As for Slovakia, this is not the result of a single mutation, but due to a group of 12 mutations in specific \"hot spots\" of the ''HGD'' gene.<ref name=Zatkova2011/> The Slovakian clustering probably arose in a small area in the northwest of the country and spread after the 1950s due to migration.<ref name=Zatkova2011/>\n\n==History==\nAlkaptonuria was one of the four diseases described by [[Archibald Edward Garrod]], as being the result of the accumulation of intermediates due to metabolic deficiencies.
