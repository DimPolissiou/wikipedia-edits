Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief [[Secretary to the Admiralty]] under both [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and [[James II of England|King James II]] through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration.

This was because religious ceremonies were not legally recognised during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]]. The couple regularly celebrated the anniversary of the first date.</ref>\n\n===Illness===\n\nFrom a young age, Pepys suffered from [[bladder stones]] in his [[urinary tract]]\u2014a condition from which his mother and brother John also later suffered.<ref>Trease 1972, p.16</ref> He was almost never without pain, as well as other symptoms, including \"blood in the urine\" ([[hematuria]]). By the time of his marriage, the condition was very severe.\n\nIn 1657 Pepys decided to undergo surgery; not an easy option, as the operation was known to be especially painful and hazardous. Nevertheless, Pepys consulted surgeon Thomas Hollier and, on 26 March 1658, the operation took place in a bedroom in the house of Pepys' cousin Jane Turner.<ref>The procedure, described by Pepys as being \"cut of the stone\", was conducted without [[anaesthetic]]s or [[antiseptic]]s and involved restraining the patient with ropes and four strong men. The surgeon then made an incision along the [[perineum]] (between the [[scrotum]] and the [[anus]]), about three inches (8&nbsp;cm) long and deep enough to cut into the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. The stone was removed through this opening with pincers from below, assisted, from above, by a tool inserted into the bladder through the penis. A detailed description can be found in Tomalin (2002)</ref> Pepys' stone was successfully removed<ref>The stone was described as being the size of a [[tennis ball]]. Presumably a [[real tennis]] ball, which is slightly smaller than a modern [[lawn tennis]] ball, but still an unusually large stone</ref> and he resolved to hold a celebration on every anniversary of the operation, which he did for several years.<ref>On Monday 26 March 1660, he wrote, in his diary, \"This day it is two years since it pleased God that I was cut of the stone at Mrs. Turner's in Salisbury Court. And did resolve while I live to keep it a festival, as I did the last year at my house, and for ever to have Mrs. Turner and her company with me.\"</ref> However, there were long-term effects from the operation. The incision on his bladder broke open again late in his life. The procedure may have left him sterile, though there is no direct evidence for this, as he was childless before the operation.<ref>There are references in the Diary to pains in his bladder, whenever he caught cold. In April 1700, Pepys wrote, to his nephew Jackson, \"It has been my calamity for much the greatest part of this time to have been kept bedrid, under an evil so rarely known as to have had it matter of universal surprise and with little less general opinion of its dangerousness; namely, that the cicatrice of a wound occasioned upon my cutting of the stone, without hearing anything of it in all this time, should after more than 40 years' perfect cure, break out again.\" After Pepys' death, the [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] examination showed his left kidney was completely ulcerated; seven stones, weighing four-and-a-half ounces (130&nbsp;g), also were found. His bladder was gangrenous, and the old wound was broken open again.</ref> In mid-1658 Pepys moved to Axe Yard, near the modern [[Downing Street]]. He worked as a teller in the [[Exchequer]] under [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\n==The diary==\n[[File:6ann 08 samuelpepys bg 64kb.ogg|thumb|left|Spoken excerpt of Pepys's diary]]\n[[File:Pepys diary shorthand.png|thumb|A facsimile of part of the first entry in the diary]]\n[[File:Samuel Pepys bookplate 1.jpg|thumb|Samuel Pepys' bookplate.

He recorded his daily life for almost ten years. This record of a decade of Pepys' life is more than a million words long and is often regarded as Britain\u2019s most celebrated diary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2008/12/12/legends-of-british/|title=Legends of British History: Samuel Pepys|work=The Diary of Samuel Pepys|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> Pepys has been called the greatest diarist of all time due to his frankness in writing concerning his own weaknesses and the accuracy with which he records events of daily British life and major events in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kuiper|first1=Kathleen |title=Prose: Literary Terms and Concepts|date=2011|page=206 |publisher=Rosen Publishing |location=New York|isbn=978-1615304943}}</ref> Pepys wrote about the contemporary court and theatre (including his amorous affairs with the actresses), his household, and major political and social occurrences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pepys|first1=Samuel|editor1-last=Latham|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Latham|editor2-first=Linnet|title=A Pepys anthology : passages from the diary of Samuel Pepys|date=2000|publisher=Univ. of California Pr.|location=Berkeley [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-00-710530-4|edition=1. UK paperback}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have been using his diary to gain greater insight and understanding of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, the time he got up in the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He wrote at length about his new watch which he was very proud of (and which had an alarm, a new accessory at the time), a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/famouspeople/samuel_pepys/|title=BBC \u2013 Primary History \u2013 Famous People \u2013 Samuel Pepys|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917165028/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/famouspeople/samuel_pepys/|archive-date=17 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Pepys' diary is one of a very few sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper-middle-class man during the seventeenth century.\n\nAside from day-to-day activities, Pepys also commented on the significant and turbulent events of his nation. England was in disarray when he began writing his diary. [[Oliver Cromwell]] had died just a few years before, creating a period of civil unrest and a large power vacuum to be filled. Pepys had been a strong supporter of Cromwell, but he converted to the Royalist cause upon the Protector\u2019s death. He was on the ship that brought Charles II home to England. He gave a firsthand account of events, such as the coronation of King Charles II and the Restoration of the British Monarchy to the throne, the Anglo-Dutch war, the [[Great Plague]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].\n\nPepys did not plan on his contemporaries ever seeing his diary, which is evident from the fact that he wrote in shorthand and sometimes in a \"code\" of various Spanish, French, and Italian words (especially when describing his illicit affairs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepys.info/bits.html|title=Pepys coded passages|work=pepys.info|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> However, Pepys often juxtaposed profanities in his native English amidst his \"code\" of foreign words, a practice which would reveal the details to any casual reader. He did intend future generations to see the diary, as evidenced by its inclusion in his library and its catalogue before his death along with the shorthand guide he used and the elaborate planning by which he ensured his library survived intact after his death.<ref>'Samuel Pepys \u2013 The Unequalled Self', ''Claire Tomalin, p.645 and p. 653''</ref>\n \nThe women whom he pursued, his friends, and his dealings are all laid out. His diary reveals his jealousies, insecurities, trivial concerns, and his fractious relationship with his wife. It has been an important account of London in the 1660s. The juxtaposition of his commentary on politics and national events, alongside the very personal, can be seen from the beginning. His opening paragraphs, written in January 1660, begin:\n\n{{quote|Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain but upon taking of cold. I lived in Axe yard, having my wife and servant Jane, and no more in family than us three. My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks,<ref>This mention of Elizabeth Pepys' menstruation was omitted from the [[Expurgation|bowdlerised]] Wheatley transcription published in 1893 and used throughout this article. The quotation here uses the copyrighted Latham and Mathews edition to restore the text.</ref> gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again.\n\nThe condition of the State was thus. ''[[Viz.]]'' the [[Rump Parliament|Rump]], after being disturbed by my [[John Lambert (general)|Lord Lambert]], was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the army all forced to yield. [[John Lawson (naval officer)|Lawson]] lie[s] still in the River and [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|Monke]] is with his army in Scotland. Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come in to the Parliament; nor is it expected that he will, without being forced to it.\n| {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1660/January|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', January 1660]]}}}}\n\nThe entries from the first few months were filled with news of [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General George Monck]]'s march on London. In April and May of that year, he was encountering problems with his wife, and he accompanied Montagu's fleet to the [[Netherlands]] to bring [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back from exile. Montagu was made [[Earl of Sandwich]] on 18 June, and Pepys secured the position of [[Clerk of the Acts]] to the [[Navy Board]] on 13 July.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> As secretary to the board, Pepys was entitled to a \u00a3350 annual salary plus the various gratuities and benefits that came with the job\u2013including bribes. He rejected an offer of \u00a31,000 for the position from a rival and soon afterwards moved to official accommodation in Seething Lane in the [[City of London]].\n\nPepys stopped writing his diary in 1669. His eyesight began to trouble him and he feared that writing in dim light was damaging his eyes. He did imply in his last entries that he might have others write his diary for him, but doing so would result in a loss of privacy and it seems that he never went through with those plans. In the end, Pepys' fears were unjustified and he lived another 34 years without going blind, but he never took to writing his diary again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepys.info/faq.html|title=Samuel Pepys FAQ|work=pepys.info|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Pepys dictated a journal for two months in 1669\u201370 as a record of his dealings with the Commissioners of Accounts at that period.<ref>Bryant, ''The Years of Peril'', p. 25.</ref> He also kept a diary for a few months in 1683 when he was sent to Tangier, Morocco as the most senior civil servant in the navy, during the [[English Tangier#Evacuation of Tangier|English evacuation]]. The diary mostly covers work-related matters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |date=13 November 2015 |title=Samuel Pepys' other diary on display in new exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/samuel-pepys-other-diary-on-display-exhibition-national-maritime-museum |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=15 November 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Public life===\n[[File:PepysLetter.jpg|thumb|A short letter from Samuel Pepys to [[John Evelyn]] at the latter's home in [[Deptford]], written by Pepys on 16 October 1665 and referring to \"prisoners\" and \"sick men\" during the [[Second Dutch War]]]]\n\nOn the Navy Board, Pepys proved to be a more able and efficient worker than colleagues in higher positions. This often annoyed Pepys and provoked much harsh criticism in his diary. Among his colleagues were [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Sir William Penn]], [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]], [[John Mennes|Sir John Mennes]] and [[William Batten|Sir William Batten]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nPepys learned arithmetic from a private tutor and used models of ships to make up for his lack of first-hand nautical experience, and ultimately came to play a significant role in the board's activities. In September 1660, he was made a [[Justice of the Peace]]; on 15 February 1662, Pepys was admitted as a Younger Brother of [[Trinity House]]; and on 30 April, he received the [[Freedom of the City|freedom of]] [[Portsmouth]]. Through Sandwich, he was involved in the administration of the short-lived [[English Tangier|English colony at Tangier]]. He joined the Tangier committee in August 1662 when the colony was first founded and became its treasurer in 1665. In 1663, he independently negotiated a \u00a33,000 contract for Norwegian masts, demonstrating the freedom of action that his superior abilities allowed. He was appointed to a commission of the royal fishery on 8 April 1664.\n\nPepys' job required him to meet many people to dispense money and make contracts. He often laments how he \"lost his labour\" having gone to some appointment at a [[coffee house]] or [[tavern]], only to discover that the person whom he was seeking was not there. These occasions were a constant source of frustration to Pepys.\n\n===Major events===\nPepys' diary provides a first-hand account of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and it is also notable for its detailed accounts of several major events of the 1660s, along with the lesser known [[John Evelyn's Diary|diary of John Evelyn]]. In particular, it is an invaluable source for the study of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] of 1665\u20137, the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] of 1665, and the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. In relation to the Plague and Fire, C. S. Knighton has written: \"From its reporting of these two disasters to the metropolis in which he thrived, Pepys' diary has become a national monument.\"<ref>Knighton (2004).</ref> [[Robert Latham (editor)|Robert Latham]], editor of the definitive edition of the diary, remarks concerning the Plague and Fire: \"His descriptions of both\u2014agonisingly vivid\u2014achieve their effect by being something more than superlative reporting; they are written with compassion.

The captured ship [[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|''Royal Charles'']] is right of centre.]]\n\nIn early 1665, the start of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] placed great pressure on Pepys. His colleagues were either engaged elsewhere or incompetent, and Pepys had to conduct a great deal of business himself. He excelled under the pressure, which was extreme due to the complexity and under-funding of the Royal Navy.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> At the outset, he proposed a centralised approach to supplying the fleet. His idea was accepted, and he was made surveyor-general of [[Food|victualling]] in October 1665. The position brought a further \u00a3300 a year.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nPepys wrote about the Second Anglo-Dutch War: \"In all things, in wisdom, courage, force and success, the Dutch have the best of us and do end the war with victory on their side\". And [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] said: \"Don't fight the Dutch, imitate them\".\n\nIn 1667, with the war lost, Pepys helped to discharge the navy.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> The Dutch had defeated England on open water and now began to threaten English soil itself. In June 1667, they conducted their [[Raid on the Medway]], broke the defensive chain at [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], and towed away the {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|2}}, one of the Royal Navy's most important ships. As he had done during the Fire and the Plague, Pepys again removed his wife and his gold from London.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nThe Dutch raid was a major concern in itself, but Pepys was personally placed under a different kind of pressure: the Navy Board and his role as Clerk of the Acts came under scrutiny from the public and from Parliament. The war ended in August and, on 17 October, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] created a committee of \"miscarriages\".<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> On 20 October, a list was demanded from Pepys of ships and commanders at the time of the division of the fleet in 1666.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> However, these demands were actually quite desirable for him, as tactical and strategic mistakes were not the responsibility of the Navy Board.\n\nThe Board did face some allegations regarding the Medway raid, but they could exploit the criticism already attracted by commissioner of [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] [[Peter Pett]] to deflect criticism from themselves.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> The committee accepted this tactic when they reported in February 1668. The Board was, however, criticised for its use of tickets to pay seamen. These tickets could only be exchanged for cash at the Navy's treasury in London.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> Pepys made a long speech at the bar of the Commons on 5 March 1668 defending this practice. It was, in the words of C. S. Knighton, a \"virtuoso performance\".<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nThe commission was followed by an investigation led by a more powerful authority, the commissioners of accounts. They met at Brooke House, [[Holborn]] and spent two years scrutinising how the war had been financed. In 1669, Pepys had to prepare detailed answers to the committee's eight \"Observations\" on the Navy Board's conduct. In 1670, he was forced to defend his own role. A seaman's ticket with Pepys' name on it was produced as incontrovertible evidence of his corrupt dealings but, thanks to the intervention of the king, Pepys emerged from the sustained investigation relatively unscathed.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\n====Great Plague====\n{{Further|The Great Plague of London}}\n\nOutbreaks of plague were not particularly unusual events in London; major epidemics had occurred in 1592, 1603, 1625 and 1636.<ref name=\"Tomalin, p167\" >Tomalin (2004), p. 167</ref> Furthermore, Pepys was not among the group of people who were most at risk. He did not live in cramped housing, he did not routinely mix with the poor, and he was not required to keep his family in London in the event of a crisis.<ref name=\"Tomalin, p168\" >Tomalin (2004), p.&nbsp;168</ref> It was not until June 1665 that the unusual seriousness of the plague became apparent, so Pepys' activities in the first five months of 1665 were not significantly affected by it.<ref>Tomalin (2004), p. 168</ref> Indeed, [[Claire Tomalin]] writes that \"the most notable fact about Pepys' plague year is that to him it was one of the happiest of his life.\" In 1665, he worked very hard, and the outcome was that he quadrupled his fortune.<ref name=\"Tomalin, p168\" /> In his annual summary on 31 December, he wrote, \"I have never lived so merrily (besides that I never got so much) as I have done this plague time\".<ref>{{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1665/December#31st (Lord's day)|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Sunday, 31 December 1665]]}}</ref> Nonetheless, Pepys was certainly concerned about the plague. On 16 August he wrote:\n\n{{quote|But, Lord! how sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people, and very few upon the 'Change. Jealous of every door that one sees shut up, lest it should be the plague; and about us two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up.| {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1665/August#16th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Wednesday, 16 August 1665]]}}}}\n\nHe also chewed tobacco as a protection against infection, and worried that [[wig-makers]] might be using hair from the corpses as a raw material. Furthermore, it was Pepys who suggested that the Navy Office should evacuate to [[Greenwich]], although he did offer to remain in town himself. He later took great pride in his stoicism.<ref>Tomalin (2004), pp. 174\u20135</ref> Meanwhile, Elisabeth Pepys was sent to [[Woolwich]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> She did not return to Seething Lane until January 1666, and was shocked by the sight of [[St Olave Hart Street|St Olave]]'s churchyard, where 300 people had been buried.<ref>Tomalin (2004), pp.&nbsp;177\u20138</ref>\n\n====Great Fire of London====\n{{Further|Great Fire of London}}\n\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|Map of London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in 1666, showing Pepys' home]]\n\nIn the early hours of 2 September 1666, Pepys was awakened by his servant who had spotted a fire in the [[Billingsgate]] area. He decided that the fire was not particularly serious and returned to bed. Shortly after waking, his servant returned and reported that 300 houses had been destroyed and that [[London Bridge]] was threatened. Pepys went to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] to get a better view. Without returning home, he took a boat and observed the fire for over an hour. In his diary, Pepys recorded his observations as follows:\n\n{{quote|I down to the water-side, and there got a boat and through bridge, and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michell's house, as far as the Old Swan, already burned that way, and the fire running further, that in a very little time it got as far as the Steeleyard, while I was there. Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that layoff; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another. And among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were, some of them burned, their wings, and fell down. Having staid, and in an hour's time seen the fire: rage every way, and nobody, to my sight, endeavouring to quench it, but to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire, and having seen it get as far as the Steele-yard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into the City; and every thing, after so long a drought, proving combustible, even the very stones of churches, and among other things the poor steeple by which pretty Mrs.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 lives, and whereof my old school-fellow Elborough is parson, taken fire in the very top, and there burned till it fell down...| {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1666/September#2nd (Lord's day)|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Sunday, 2 September 1666]]}}}}\n\nThe wind was driving the fire westward, so he ordered the boat to go to [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] and became the first person to inform the king of the fire. According to his entry of 2 September 1666, Pepys recommended to the king that homes be pulled down in the path of the fire in order to stem its progress. Accepting this advice, the king told him to go to [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] [[Thomas Bloodworth]] and tell him to start pulling down houses. Pepys took a coach back as far as [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]] before setting off on foot through the burning city. He found the Lord Mayor, who said, \"Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.\" At noon, he returned home and \"had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be\", before returning to watch the fire in the city once more. Later, he returned to Whitehall, then met his wife in [[St. James's Park]]. In the evening, they watched the fire from the safety of [[Bankside]]. Pepys writes that \"it made me weep to see it\". Returning home, Pepys met his clerk Tom Hayter who had lost everything. Hearing news that the fire was advancing, he started to pack up his possessions by moonlight.\n\n[[File:Old.St.Pauls.Ruins.1666.png|thumb|The ruins of the [[old St Paul's Cathedral]], by [[Thomas Wyck]], as it looked roughly seven years after the fire]]\n\nA cart arrived at 4 a.m. on 3 September and Pepys spent much of the day arranging the removal of his possessions. Many of his valuables, including his diary, were sent to a friend from the Navy Office at [[Bethnal Green]].<ref name=\"Tomalin 2004, p. 230\">Tomalin (2004), p. 230</ref> At night, he \"fed upon the remains of yesterday's dinner, having no fire nor dishes, nor any opportunity of dressing any thing.\" The next day, Pepys continued to arrange the removal of his possessions. By then, he believed that Seething Lane was in grave danger, so he suggested calling men from [[Deptford]] to help pull down houses and defend the king's property.<ref name=\"Tomalin 2004, p. 230\"/> He described the chaos in the city and his curious attempt at saving his own goods:\n\n{{quote|Sir W. Pen and I to Tower-streete, and there met the fire burning three or four doors beyond Mr. Howell's, whose goods, poor man, his trayes, and dishes, shovells, &c., were flung all along Tower-street in the kennels, and people working therewith from one end to the other; the fire coming on in that narrow streete, on both sides, with infinite fury. Sir W. Batten not knowing how to remove his wine, did dig a pit in the garden, and laid it in there; and I took the opportunity of laying all the papers of my office that I could not otherwise dispose of. And in the evening Sir W. Pen and I did dig another, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese, as well as my wine and some other things.| {{Ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1666/September#4th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Tuesday, 4 September 1666]]}}}}\n\nPepys had taken to sleeping on his office floor; on Wednesday, 5 September, he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. She told him that the fire had almost reached [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower]] and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold\u2014about \u00a32,350\u2014to [[Woolwich]]. In the following days, Pepys witnessed looting, disorder, and disruption. On 7 September, he went to Paul's Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul's Cathedral, of his old school, of his father's house, and of the house in which he had had his stone removed.<ref>Tomalin (2004), p. 232</ref> Despite all this destruction, Pepys' house, office, and diary were saved.\n\n===Personal life===\n[[File:Punch Plaque Covent Garden.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Plaque commemorating Pepys as a witness to the first performance of the puppet show ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' on [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]] in [[Covent Garden]], 1662]]\nThe diary gives a detailed account of Pepys' personal life. He liked wine, plays, and the company of other people. He also spent time evaluating his fortune and his place in the world. He was always curious and often acted on that curiosity, as he acted upon almost all his impulses. Periodically, he would resolve to devote more time to hard work instead of leisure. For example, in his entry for New Year's Eve, 1661, he writes: \"I have newly taken a solemn oath about abstaining from plays and wine\u2026\" The following months reveal his lapses to the reader; by 17 February, it is recorded, \"Here I drank wine upon necessity, being ill for the want of it.\"\n\nPepys was one of the most important civil servants of his age, and was also a widely cultivated man, taking an interest in books, music, the theatre and science. He was passionately interested in music; he composed, sang, and played for pleasure, and even arranged music lessons for his servants. He played the [[lute]], [[viol]], violin, [[flageolet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and [[spinet]] to varying degrees of proficiency.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> He was also a keen singer, performing at home, in coffee houses, and even in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> He and his wife took flageolet lessons from master Thomas Greeting.<ref>[http://flageolets.com/biographies/greeting.php Biography of Thomas Greeting] The Pleasant Companion-The Flageolets Site</ref> He also taught his wife to sing and paid for dancing lessons for her (although these stopped when he became jealous of the dancing master).\n\nHe was known to be brutal to his servants, once beating a servant Jane with a broom until she cried. He kept a boy servant whom he frequently beat with a cane, a birch rod, a whip or a rope\u2019s end.<ref>Bryson, Bill. ''At Home, A Short History of Private Life'', Random House, 2010, p 122</ref>\n\nPepys was an investor in the [[Royal African Company|Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa]], which held the monopoly in England on trading along the [[West Africa|west coast of Africa]] in [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The sugar barons : family, corruption, empire, and war in the West Indies|last=Matthew|first=Parker|date=2011|publisher=Walker & Co|isbn=9780802717443|location=New York|pages=126|oclc=682894539}}</ref>\n\n====Sexual relations====\n\nPropriety did not prevent him from engaging in a number of extramarital liaisons with various women that were chronicled in his diary, often in some detail, and generally using a cocktail of languages (English, French, Spanish and Latin) when relating the intimate details. The most dramatic of these encounters was with [[Deb Willet|Deborah Willet]], a young woman engaged as a [[Lady's companion|companion]] for Elisabeth Pepys. On 25 October 1668, Pepys was surprised by his wife as he embraced Deb Willet; he writes that his wife \"coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con ''[with]'' my hand sub ''[under]'' su ''[her]'' coats; and endeed I was with my main ''[hand]'' in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also....\" Following this event, he was characteristically filled with remorse, but (equally characteristically) continued to pursue Willet after she had been dismissed from the Pepys household.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/6051128.stm Mystery of Pepys' affair solved] BBC News 24 14 October 2006</ref> Pepys also had a habit of fondling the breasts of his maid Mary Mercer while she dressed him in the morning.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bryson|first= Bill|date= 2010|title= At Home|url= |location= Canada|publisher= Anchor Random House|page= 123|isbn= 978-0385661645|author-link= Bill Bryson|quote= Of one maid, Mary Mercer, the Dictionary of National Biography serenely notes: \u201cSamuel seems to have made a habit of fondling Mercer\u2019s breasts while she dressed him in the morning\u201d\u2026When they weren\u2019t dressing him, absorbing his blows, or providing roosts for his gropes, Pepys' servants were expected to comb his hair and wash his ears.}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Mary Knep|Mrs Knep]] was the wife of a [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] horsedealer, and the mistress of Pepys\"\u2014or at least \"she granted him a share of her favours\".<ref>Peter Cunningham, ''The Story of Nell Gwyn'', Gordon Goodwin, ed., Edinburgh, John Grant, 1908; pp. 12, 171.</ref> Scholars disagree on the full extent of the Pepys/Knep relationship, but much of later generations' knowledge of Knep comes from the diary. Pepys first met Knep on 6 December 1665. He described her as \"pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life.\" He called her husband \"an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow\"<ref>Pepys' Diary entry of 8 December 1665.</ref> and suspected him of abusing his wife. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip. When they wrote notes to each other, Pepys signed himself \"Dapper Dickey\", while Knep was \"[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbry Allen]]\" (that popular song was an item in her musical repertory).\n\n===Text of the diary===\nThe diary was written in one of the many standard forms of [[shorthand]] used in Pepys' time, in this case called tachygraphy and devised by [[Thomas Shelton (stenographer)|Thomas Shelton]]. It is clear from its content that it was written as a purely personal record of his life and not for publication, yet there are indications that Pepys took steps to preserve the bound manuscripts of his diary. He wrote it out in fair copy from rough notes, and he also had the loose pages bound into six volumes, catalogued them in his library with all his other books, and is likely to have suspected that eventually someone would find them interesting.\n\n=== Simplified Pepys family tree ===\nThis tree resumes, in a more compact form and with a few additional details, trees published elsewhere in a box-like form.<ref name=\"Tomalin (2002) p6-7\">Tomalin (2002), {{p.|xii-xiii}}.</ref><ref name=\"Latham & Matthews (1970-83) Vol. X - Companion\">Latham & Matthews (1970\u201383), Vol. X \u2013 Companion.</ref> It is meant to help the reader of the ''Diary'' and also integrates some biographical informations found in the same sources.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background:LightBlue; text-align:center;\n|title=Simplified Pepys family tree}}\n{{Tree list}}\n* '''William Pepys''' of Cottenham (Cambs.) <small>(? \u2013 1519)</small>\n** '''Thomas Pepys'''\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Richard Pepys''' <small>(? \u2013 ''c.'' 1571)</small>\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''William Pepys''' of Norwich, ''draper'' <small>(1561 \u2013 ''c.'' 1639)</small>\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Richard Pepys''' of London, ''upholsterer'' <small>(? \u2013 1679)</small>\n** '''John Pepys''' of South Creak (Norf.) <small>(? \u2013 1542)</small>\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Thomas Pepys''' <small>(? \u2013 1569)</small>\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Jerome Pepys''' <small>(1548\u20131634)</small>\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''John Pepys''' of Ashtead (Surrey), ''man of business to Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]]'' <small>(1576\u20131652)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+<small>(1610)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Anne Walpole'''\n****** '''Edward Pepys''' of Broomsthorpe (Norf.), ''lawyer'' <small>(1617\u20131663)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Elizabeth Walpole'''\n****** '''Elizabeth Pepys'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Thomas Dyke'''\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Jane Pepys (\u201cMadam Turner\u201d)''' <small>(1623\u20131686)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+<small>(1650)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''John Turner''', ''Yorkshire lawyer'' <small>(1631\u20131689)</small>\n******* '''Charles Turner'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Margaret Cholmley'''\n******* '''Theophila Turner (\u201cThe\u201d)''' <small>(1652\u20131702)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+<small>(1673)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet, of Stowford]]''', ''M.P. for Okehampton'' <small>(''c.'' 1650 \u2013 1686)</small>\n******* '''William Turner'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Foulis'''\n******* {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Elizabeth Turner (\u201cBetty\u201d)'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''William Hooker'''\n** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''William Pepys''' of Cottenham (Cambs.)\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''John Pepys''' of Cottenham and Impington (Cambs.) <small>(? \u2013 1589)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''? ?'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Edith Talbot''' <small>(? \u2013 1583)</small>\n**** '''John Pepys'''<sup>&nbsp;1</sup> <small>(? \u2013 1604)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Elizabeth Bendish''' of Essex\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''[[Richard Pepys|Sir Richard Pepys]]''', ''M.P. for Sudbury and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland'' <small>(1589\u20131659)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) +<small>(1620)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Judith Cutte'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Gosnold'''\n****** '''Richard Pepys'''  of Ashen (Essex), ''lawyer'' <small>(? \u2013 1664)</small>\n****** '''Samuel Pepys''' of Dublin, ''clergyman''\n****** '''Elizabeth Pepys'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Thomas Strudwick''', ''confectioner''\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Judith Pepys''' <small>(? \u2013 1664)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Benjamin Scott''', ''pewterer'' <small>(? \u2013 1664)</small>\n**** '''Thomas Pepys (\u201cthe Black\u201d)'''<sup>&nbsp;1</sup> <small>(? \u2013 1606)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Day'''\n***** '''Robert Pepys''' of Brampton (Hunts.), ''bailiff at Hinchingbrooke'' <small>(? \u2013 1661)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Anne, widow Trice'''\n***** '''Thomas Pepys''' of St Alphage <small>(1595\u20131676)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Syvret [Chiveret]'''\n****** '''Thomas Pepys (\u201cthe turner\u201d)''', ''trader with the W.

In 1675 he was appointed a Governor of Christ's Hospital and for many years he took a close interest in its affairs. Among his papers are two detailed memoranda on the administration of the school. In 1699, after the successful conclusion of a seven-year campaign to get the master of the Mathematical School replaced by a man who knew more about the sea, he was rewarded for his service as a Governor by being made a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]]. He also served as Master (without ever having been a Freeman or Liveryman) of the [[Clothworkers' Company]] (1677-8).\n\nAt the beginning of 1679 Pepys was elected MP for [[Harwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Harwich]] in Charles II's third parliament which formed part of the [[Cavalier Parliament]]. He was elected along with [[Anthony Deane (mayor)|Sir Anthony Deane]], a Harwich alderman and leading naval architect, to whom Pepys had been patron since 1662. By May of that year, they were under attack from their political enemies. Pepys resigned as Secretary to the Admiralty.

The phantom [[Pepys Island]], alleged to be near [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], was named after him in 1684, having been first \"discovered\" during his tenure at the Admiralty.\n\nFrom 1685 to 1688, he was active not only as Secretary of the Admiralty, but also as MP for Harwich. He had been elected MP for [[Sandwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Sandwich]], but this election was contested and he immediately withdrew to Harwich. When James fled the country at the end of 1688, Pepys' career also came to an end. In January 1689, he was defeated in the parliamentary election at Harwich; in February, one week after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], he resigned his secretaryship.\n\n===Royal Society===\n[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isaac Newton]]'s personal copy of the first edition of his ''Principia Mathematica'', bearing Pepys' name]]\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1665 and served as its President from 1 December 1684 to 30 November 1686.

He had no children and bequeathed his estate to his unmarried nephew John Jackson. Pepys had disinherited his nephew Samuel Jackson for marrying contrary to his wishes. When John Jackson died in 1724, Pepys' estate reverted to Anne, daughter of Archdeacon Samuel Edgeley, niece of Will Hewer and sister of Hewer Edgeley, nephew and godson of Pepys' old Admiralty employee and friend Will Hewer. Hewer was also childless and left his immense estate to his nephew Hewer Edgeley (consisting mostly of the Clapham property, as well as lands in Clapham, London, Westminster and Norfolk) on condition that the nephew (and godson) would adopt the surname Hewer. So Will Hewer's heir became Hewer Edgeley-Hewer, and he adopted the old Will Hewer home in Clapham as his residence. That is how the Edgeley family acquired the estates of both Samuel Pepys and Will Hewer, sister Anne inheriting Pepys' estate, and brother Hewer inheriting that of Will Hewer. On the death of Hewer Edgeley-Hewer in 1728, the old Hewer estate went to Edgeley-Hewer's widow Elizabeth, who left the {{convert|432|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} estate to Levett Blackborne, the son of Abraham Blackborne, merchant of Clapham, and other family members, who later sold it off in lots. Lincoln's Inn barrister Levett Blackborne also later acted as attorney in legal scuffles for the heirs who had inherited the Pepys estate.\n\nPepys' former [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] and friend Hewer acted as the executor of Pepys' estate.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gyq6euwfZj8C&pg=RA2-PA271&lpg=RA2-PA271&dq=%22hewer+edgeley#PRA2-PA271,M1\n  |title=Will Hewer, The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Samuel Pepys, 1899\n|last1=Pepys\n|first1=Samuel\n|year=1899\n}}</ref>\n\nPepys was buried along with his wife in [[St Olave's Church, Hart Street]] in London.\n\n==Pepys Library==\n{{Main|Pepys Library}}\n\n[[File:PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Pepys Library|Pepys Building]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]]]\n[[File:Pepys Library c1870.jpg|thumb|Pepys Library c. 1870]]\n\nPepys was a lifelong [[bibliophile]] and carefully nurtured his large collection of books, manuscripts, and prints.

In 2003 a television film ''[[The Private Life of Samuel Pepys]]'' aired on [[BBC2]]. [[Steve Coogan]] played Pepys. The 2004 film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' concerns London theatre in the 17th century and is based on [[Jeffrey Hatcher]]'s play ''Compleat Female Stage Beauty'', which in turn was inspired by a reference in Pepys' diary to the actor [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]], who played female roles in the days when women were forbidden to appear on stage.

This was because religious ceremonies were not legally recognised during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]]. The couple regularly celebrated the anniversary of the first date.</ref>\n\n===Illness===\n\nFrom a young age, Pepys suffered from [[bladder stones]] in his [[urinary tract]]\u2014a condition from which his mother and brother John also later suffered.<ref>Trease 1972, p.16</ref> He was almost never without pain, as well as other symptoms, including \"blood in the urine\" ([[hematuria]]). By the time of his marriage, the condition was very severe.\n\nIn 1657 Pepys decided to undergo surgery; not an easy option, as the operation was known to be especially painful and hazardous. Nevertheless, Pepys consulted surgeon Thomas Hollier and, on 26 March 1658, the operation took place in a bedroom in the house of Pepys' cousin Jane Turner.<ref>The procedure, described by Pepys as being \"cut of the stone\", was conducted without [[anaesthetic]]s or [[antiseptic]]s and involved restraining the patient with ropes and four strong men. The surgeon then made an incision along the [[perineum]] (between the [[scrotum]] and the [[anus]]), about three inches (8&nbsp;cm) long and deep enough to cut into the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. The stone was removed through this opening with pincers from below, assisted, from above, by a tool inserted into the bladder through the penis. A detailed description can be found in Tomalin (2002)</ref> Pepys' stone was successfully removed<ref>The stone was described as being the size of a [[tennis ball]]. Presumably a [[real tennis]] ball, which is slightly smaller than a modern [[lawn tennis]] ball, but still an unusually large stone</ref> and he resolved to hold a celebration on every anniversary of the operation, which he did for several years.<ref>On Monday 26 March 1660, he wrote, in his diary, \"This day it is two years since it pleased God that I was cut of the stone at Mrs. Turner's in Salisbury Court. And did resolve while I live to keep it a festival, as I did the last year at my house, and for ever to have Mrs. Turner and her company with me.\"</ref> However, there were long-term effects from the operation. The incision on his bladder broke open again late in his life. The procedure may have left him sterile, though there is no direct evidence for this, as he was childless before the operation.<ref>There are references in the Diary to pains in his bladder, whenever he caught cold. In April 1700, Pepys wrote, to his nephew Jackson, \"It has been my calamity for much the greatest part of this time to have been kept bedrid, under an evil so rarely known as to have had it matter of universal surprise and with little less general opinion of its dangerousness; namely, that the cicatrice of a wound occasioned upon my cutting of the stone, without hearing anything of it in all this time, should after more than 40 years' perfect cure, break out again.\" After Pepys' death, the [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] examination showed his left kidney was completely ulcerated; seven stones, weighing four-and-a-half ounces (130&nbsp;g), also were found. His bladder was gangrenous, and the old wound was broken open again.</ref> In mid-1658 Pepys moved to Axe Yard, near the modern [[Downing Street]]. He worked as a teller in the [[Exchequer]] under [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\n==The diary==\n[[File:6ann 08 samuelpepys bg 64kb.ogg|thumb|left|Spoken excerpt of Pepys's diary]]\n[[File:Pepys diary shorthand.png|thumb|A facsimile of part of the first entry in the diary]]\n[[File:Samuel Pepys bookplate 1.jpg|thumb|Samuel Pepys' bookplate.

UK paperback}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have been using his diary to gain greater insight and understanding of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, the time he got up in the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He wrote at length about his new watch which he was very proud of (and which had an alarm, a new accessory at the time), a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/famouspeople/samuel_pepys/|title=BBC \u2013 Primary History \u2013 Famous People \u2013 Samuel Pepys|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917165028/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/famouspeople/samuel_pepys/|archive-date=17 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Pepys' diary is one of a very few sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper-middle-class man during the seventeenth century.\n\nAside from day-to-day activities, Pepys also commented on the significant and turbulent events of his nation. England was in disarray when he began writing his diary. [[Oliver Cromwell]] had died just a few years before, creating a period of civil unrest and a large power vacuum to be filled. Pepys had been a strong supporter of Cromwell, but he converted to the Royalist cause upon the Protector\u2019s death. He was on the ship that brought Charles II home to England. He gave a firsthand account of events, such as the coronation of King Charles II and the Restoration of the British Monarchy to the throne, the Anglo-Dutch war, the [[Great Plague]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].\n\nPepys did not plan on his contemporaries ever seeing his diary, which is evident from the fact that he wrote in shorthand and sometimes in a \"code\" of various Spanish, French, and Italian words (especially when describing his illicit affairs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepys.info/bits.html|title=Pepys coded passages|work=pepys.info|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> However, Pepys often juxtaposed profanities in his native English amidst his \"code\" of foreign words, a practice which would reveal the details to any casual reader. He did intend future generations to see the diary, as evidenced by its inclusion in his library and its catalogue before his death along with the shorthand guide he used and the elaborate planning by which he ensured his library survived intact after his death.<ref>'Samuel Pepys \u2013 The Unequalled Self', ''Claire Tomalin, p.645 and p. 653''</ref>\n \nThe women whom he pursued, his friends, and his dealings are all laid out. His diary reveals his jealousies, insecurities, trivial concerns, and his fractious relationship with his wife. It has been an important account of London in the 1660s. The juxtaposition of his commentary on politics and national events, alongside the very personal, can be seen from the beginning. His opening paragraphs, written in January 1660, begin:\n\n{{quote|Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain but upon taking of cold. I lived in Axe yard, having my wife and servant Jane, and no more in family than us three. My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks,<ref>This mention of Elizabeth Pepys' menstruation was omitted from the [[Expurgation|bowdlerised]] Wheatley transcription published in 1893 and used throughout this article. The quotation here uses the copyrighted Latham and Mathews edition to restore the text.</ref> gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again.\n\nThe condition of the State was thus. ''[[Viz.]]'' the [[Rump Parliament|Rump]], after being disturbed by my [[John Lambert (general)|Lord Lambert]], was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the army all forced to yield. [[John Lawson (naval officer)|Lawson]] lie[s] still in the River and [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|Monke]] is with his army in Scotland. Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come in to the Parliament; nor is it expected that he will, without being forced to it.\n| {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1660/January|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', January 1660]]}}}}\n\nThe entries from the first few months were filled with news of [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General George Monck]]'s march on London. In April and May of that year, he was encountering problems with his wife, and he accompanied Montagu's fleet to the [[Netherlands]] to bring [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back from exile. Montagu was made [[Earl of Sandwich]] on 18 June, and Pepys secured the position of [[Clerk of the Acts]] to the [[Navy Board]] on 13 July.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> As secretary to the board, Pepys was entitled to a \u00a3350 annual salary plus the various gratuities and benefits that came with the job\u2013including bribes. He rejected an offer of \u00a31,000 for the position from a rival and soon afterwards moved to official accommodation in Seething Lane in the [[City of London]].\n\nPepys stopped writing his diary in 1669. His eyesight began to trouble him and he feared that writing in dim light was damaging his eyes. He did imply in his last entries that he might have others write his diary for him, but doing so would result in a loss of privacy and it seems that he never went through with those plans. In the end, Pepys' fears were unjustified and he lived another 34 years without going blind, but he never took to writing his diary again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepys.info/faq.html|title=Samuel Pepys FAQ|work=pepys.info|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Pepys dictated a journal for two months in 1669\u201370 as a record of his dealings with the Commissioners of Accounts at that period.<ref>Bryant, ''The Years of Peril'', p. 25.</ref> He also kept a diary for a few months in 1683 when he was sent to Tangier, Morocco as the most senior civil servant in the navy, during the [[English Tangier#Evacuation of Tangier|English evacuation]]. The diary mostly covers work-related matters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |date=13 November 2015 |title=Samuel Pepys' other diary on display in new exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/samuel-pepys-other-diary-on-display-exhibition-national-maritime-museum |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=15 November 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Public life===\n[[File:PepysLetter.jpg|thumb|A short letter from Samuel Pepys to [[John Evelyn]] at the latter's home in [[Deptford]], written by Pepys on 16 October 1665 and referring to \"prisoners\" and \"sick men\" during the [[Second Dutch War]]]]\n\nOn the Navy Board, Pepys proved to be a more able and efficient worker than colleagues in higher positions. This often annoyed Pepys and provoked much harsh criticism in his diary. Among his colleagues were [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Sir William Penn]], [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]], [[John Mennes|Sir John Mennes]] and [[William Batten|Sir William Batten]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nPepys learned arithmetic from a private tutor and used models of ships to make up for his lack of first-hand nautical experience, and ultimately came to play a significant role in the board's activities. In September 1660, he was made a [[Justice of the Peace]]; on 15 February 1662, Pepys was admitted as a Younger Brother of [[Trinity House]]; and on 30 April, he received the [[Freedom of the City|freedom of]] [[Portsmouth]]. Through Sandwich, he was involved in the administration of the short-lived [[English Tangier|English colony at Tangier]]. He joined the Tangier committee in August 1662 when the colony was first founded and became its treasurer in 1665. In 1663, he independently negotiated a \u00a33,000 contract for Norwegian masts, demonstrating the freedom of action that his superior abilities allowed. He was appointed to a commission of the royal fishery on 8 April 1664.\n\nPepys' job required him to meet many people to dispense money and make contracts. He often laments how he \"lost his labour\" having gone to some appointment at a [[coffee house]] or [[tavern]], only to discover that the person whom he was seeking was not there. These occasions were a constant source of frustration to Pepys.\n\n===Major events===\nPepys' diary provides a first-hand account of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and it is also notable for its detailed accounts of several major events of the 1660s, along with the lesser known [[John Evelyn's Diary|diary of John Evelyn]]. In particular, it is an invaluable source for the study of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] of 1665\u20137, the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] of 1665, and the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. In relation to the Plague and Fire, C. S. Knighton has written: \"From its reporting of these two disasters to the metropolis in which he thrived, Pepys' diary has become a national monument.\"<ref>Knighton (2004).</ref> [[Robert Latham (editor)|Robert Latham]], editor of the definitive edition of the diary, remarks concerning the Plague and Fire: \"His descriptions of both\u2014agonisingly vivid\u2014achieve their effect by being something more than superlative reporting; they are written with compassion.

The captured ship [[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|''Royal Charles'']] is right of centre.]]\n\nIn early 1665, the start of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] placed great pressure on Pepys. His colleagues were either engaged elsewhere or incompetent, and Pepys had to conduct a great deal of business himself. He excelled under the pressure, which was extreme due to the complexity and under-funding of the Royal Navy.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> At the outset, he proposed a centralised approach to supplying the fleet. His idea was accepted, and he was made surveyor-general of [[Food|victualling]] in October 1665. The position brought a further \u00a3300 a year.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nPepys wrote about the Second Anglo-Dutch War: \"In all things, in wisdom, courage, force and success, the Dutch have the best of us and do end the war with victory on their side\". And [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] said: \"Don't fight the Dutch, imitate them\".\n\nIn 1667, with the war lost, Pepys helped to discharge the navy.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> The Dutch had defeated England on open water and now began to threaten English soil itself. In June 1667, they conducted their [[Raid on the Medway]], broke the defensive chain at [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], and towed away the {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|2}}, one of the Royal Navy's most important ships. As he had done during the Fire and the Plague, Pepys again removed his wife and his gold from London.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nThe Dutch raid was a major concern in itself, but Pepys was personally placed under a different kind of pressure: the Navy Board and his role as Clerk of the Acts came under scrutiny from the public and from Parliament. The war ended in August and, on 17 October, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] created a committee of \"miscarriages\".<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> On 20 October, a list was demanded from Pepys of ships and commanders at the time of the division of the fleet in 1666.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> However, these demands were actually quite desirable for him, as tactical and strategic mistakes were not the responsibility of the Navy Board.\n\nThe Board did face some allegations regarding the Medway raid, but they could exploit the criticism already attracted by commissioner of [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] [[Peter Pett]] to deflect criticism from themselves.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> The committee accepted this tactic when they reported in February 1668. The Board was, however, criticised for its use of tickets to pay seamen. These tickets could only be exchanged for cash at the Navy's treasury in London.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> Pepys made a long speech at the bar of the Commons on 5 March 1668 defending this practice. It was, in the words of C. S. Knighton, a \"virtuoso performance\".<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\nThe commission was followed by an investigation led by a more powerful authority, the commissioners of accounts. They met at Brooke House, [[Holborn]] and spent two years scrutinising how the war had been financed. In 1669, Pepys had to prepare detailed answers to the committee's eight \"Observations\" on the Navy Board's conduct. In 1670, he was forced to defend his own role. A seaman's ticket with Pepys' name on it was produced as incontrovertible evidence of his corrupt dealings but, thanks to the intervention of the king, Pepys emerged from the sustained investigation relatively unscathed.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/>\n\n====Great Plague====\n{{Further|The Great Plague of London}}\n\nOutbreaks of plague were not particularly unusual events in London; major epidemics had occurred in 1592, 1603, 1625 and 1636.<ref name=\"Tomalin, p167\" >Tomalin (2004), p. 167</ref> Furthermore, Pepys was not among the group of people who were most at risk. He did not live in cramped housing, he did not routinely mix with the poor, and he was not required to keep his family in London in the event of a crisis.<ref name=\"Tomalin, p168\" >Tomalin (2004), p.&nbsp;168</ref> It was not until June 1665 that the unusual seriousness of the plague became apparent, so Pepys' activities in the first five months of 1665 were not significantly affected by it.<ref>Tomalin (2004), p. 168</ref> Indeed, [[Claire Tomalin]] writes that \"the most notable fact about Pepys' plague year is that to him it was one of the happiest of his life.\" In 1665, he worked very hard, and the outcome was that he quadrupled his fortune.<ref name=\"Tomalin, p168\" /> In his annual summary on 31 December, he wrote, \"I have never lived so merrily (besides that I never got so much) as I have done this plague time\".<ref>{{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1665/December#31st (Lord's day)|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Sunday, 31 December 1665]]}}</ref> Nonetheless, Pepys was certainly concerned about the plague. On 16 August he wrote:\n\n{{quote|But, Lord! how sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people, and very few upon the 'Change. Jealous of every door that one sees shut up, lest it should be the plague; and about us two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up.| {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1665/August#16th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Wednesday, 16 August 1665]]}}}}\n\nHe also chewed tobacco as a protection against infection, and worried that [[wig-makers]] might be using hair from the corpses as a raw material. Furthermore, it was Pepys who suggested that the Navy Office should evacuate to [[Greenwich]], although he did offer to remain in town himself. He later took great pride in his stoicism.<ref>Tomalin (2004), pp. 174\u20135</ref> Meanwhile, Elisabeth Pepys was sent to [[Woolwich]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> She did not return to Seething Lane until January 1666, and was shocked by the sight of [[St Olave Hart Street|St Olave]]'s churchyard, where 300 people had been buried.<ref>Tomalin (2004), pp.&nbsp;177\u20138</ref>\n\n====Great Fire of London====\n{{Further|Great Fire of London}}\n\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|Map of London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in 1666, showing Pepys' home]]\n\nIn the early hours of 2 September 1666, Pepys was awakened by his servant who had spotted a fire in the [[Billingsgate]] area. He decided that the fire was not particularly serious and returned to bed. Shortly after waking, his servant returned and reported that 300 houses had been destroyed and that [[London Bridge]] was threatened. Pepys went to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] to get a better view. Without returning home, he took a boat and observed the fire for over an hour. In his diary, Pepys recorded his observations as follows:\n\n{{quote|I down to the water-side, and there got a boat and through bridge, and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michell's house, as far as the Old Swan, already burned that way, and the fire running further, that in a very little time it got as far as the Steeleyard, while I was there. Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that layoff; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another. And among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were, some of them burned, their wings, and fell down. Having staid, and in an hour's time seen the fire: rage every way, and nobody, to my sight, endeavouring to quench it, but to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire, and having seen it get as far as the Steele-yard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into the City; and every thing, after so long a drought, proving combustible, even the very stones of churches, and among other things the poor steeple by which pretty Mrs.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 lives, and whereof my old school-fellow Elborough is parson, taken fire in the very top, and there burned till it fell down...| {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1666/September#2nd (Lord's day)|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Sunday, 2 September 1666]]}}}}\n\nThe wind was driving the fire westward, so he ordered the boat to go to [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] and became the first person to inform the king of the fire. According to his entry of 2 September 1666, Pepys recommended to the king that homes be pulled down in the path of the fire in order to stem its progress. Accepting this advice, the king told him to go to [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] [[Thomas Bloodworth]] and tell him to start pulling down houses. Pepys took a coach back as far as [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]] before setting off on foot through the burning city. He found the Lord Mayor, who said, \"Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.\" At noon, he returned home and \"had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be\", before returning to watch the fire in the city once more. Later, he returned to Whitehall, then met his wife in [[St. James's Park]]. In the evening, they watched the fire from the safety of [[Bankside]]. Pepys writes that \"it made me weep to see it\". Returning home, Pepys met his clerk Tom Hayter who had lost everything. Hearing news that the fire was advancing, he started to pack up his possessions by moonlight.\n\n[[File:Old.St.Pauls.Ruins.1666.png|thumb|The ruins of the [[old St Paul's Cathedral]], by [[Thomas Wyck]], as it looked roughly seven years after the fire]]\n\nA cart arrived at 4 a.m. on 3 September and Pepys spent much of the day arranging the removal of his possessions. Many of his valuables, including his diary, were sent to a friend from the Navy Office at [[Bethnal Green]].<ref name=\"Tomalin 2004, p. 230\">Tomalin (2004), p. 230</ref> At night, he \"fed upon the remains of yesterday's dinner, having no fire nor dishes, nor any opportunity of dressing any thing.\" The next day, Pepys continued to arrange the removal of his possessions. By then, he believed that Seething Lane was in grave danger, so he suggested calling men from [[Deptford]] to help pull down houses and defend the king's property.<ref name=\"Tomalin 2004, p. 230\"/> He described the chaos in the city and his curious attempt at saving his own goods:\n\n{{quote|Sir W. Pen and I to Tower-streete, and there met the fire burning three or four doors beyond Mr. Howell's, whose goods, poor man, his trayes, and dishes, shovells, &c., were flung all along Tower-street in the kennels, and people working therewith from one end to the other; the fire coming on in that narrow streete, on both sides, with infinite fury. Sir W. Batten not knowing how to remove his wine, did dig a pit in the garden, and laid it in there; and I took the opportunity of laying all the papers of my office that I could not otherwise dispose of. And in the evening Sir W. Pen and I did dig another, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese, as well as my wine and some other things.| {{Ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1666/September#4th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Tuesday, 4 September 1666]]}}}}\n\nPepys had taken to sleeping on his office floor; on Wednesday, 5 September, he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. She told him that the fire had almost reached [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower]] and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold\u2014about \u00a32,350\u2014to [[Woolwich]]. In the following days, Pepys witnessed looting, disorder, and disruption. On 7 September, he went to Paul's Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul's Cathedral, of his old school, of his father's house, and of the house in which he had had his stone removed.<ref>Tomalin (2004), p. 232</ref> Despite all this destruction, Pepys' house, office, and diary were saved.\n\n===Personal life===\n[[File:Punch Plaque Covent Garden.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Plaque commemorating Pepys as a witness to the first performance of the puppet show ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' on [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]] in [[Covent Garden]], 1662]]\nThe diary gives a detailed account of Pepys' personal life. He liked wine, plays, and the company of other people. He also spent time evaluating his fortune and his place in the world. He was always curious and often acted on that curiosity, as he acted upon almost all his impulses. Periodically, he would resolve to devote more time to hard work instead of leisure. For example, in his entry for New Year's Eve, 1661, he writes: \"I have newly taken a solemn oath about abstaining from plays and wine\u2026\" The following months reveal his lapses to the reader; by 17 February, it is recorded, \"Here I drank wine upon necessity, being ill for the want of it.\"\n\nPepys was one of the most important civil servants of his age, and was also a widely cultivated man, taking an interest in books, music, the theatre and science. He was passionately interested in music; he composed, sang, and played for pleasure, and even arranged music lessons for his servants. He played the [[lute]], [[viol]], violin, [[flageolet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and [[spinet]] to varying degrees of proficiency.<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> He was also a keen singer, performing at home, in coffee houses, and even in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=\"Knighton 2004\"/> He and his wife took flageolet lessons from master Thomas Greeting.<ref>[http://flageolets.com/biographies/greeting.php Biography of Thomas Greeting] The Pleasant Companion-The Flageolets Site</ref> He also taught his wife to sing and paid for dancing lessons for her (although these stopped when he became jealous of the dancing master).\n\nHe was known to be brutal to his servants, once beating a servant Jane with a broom until she cried. He kept a boy servant whom he frequently beat with a cane, a birch rod, a whip or a rope\u2019s end.<ref>Bryson, Bill. ''At Home, A Short History of Private Life'', Random House, 2010, p 122</ref>\n\nPepys was an investor in the [[Royal African Company|Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa]], which held the monopoly in England on trading along the [[West Africa|west coast of Africa]] in [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The sugar barons : family, corruption, empire, and war in the West Indies|last=Matthew|first=Parker|date=2011|publisher=Walker & Co|isbn=9780802717443|location=New York|pages=126|oclc=682894539}}</ref>\n\n====Sexual relations====\n\nPropriety did not prevent him from engaging in a number of extramarital liaisons with various women that were chronicled in his diary, often in some detail, and generally using a cocktail of languages (English, French, Spanish and Latin) when relating the intimate details. The most dramatic of these encounters was with [[Deb Willet|Deborah Willet]], a young woman engaged as a [[Lady's companion|companion]] for Elisabeth Pepys. On 25 October 1668, Pepys was surprised by his wife as he embraced Deb Willet; he writes that his wife \"coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con ''[with]'' my hand sub ''[under]'' su ''[her]'' coats; and endeed I was with my main ''[hand]'' in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also....\" Following this event, he was characteristically filled with remorse, but (equally characteristically) continued to pursue Willet after she had been dismissed from the Pepys household.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/6051128.stm Mystery of Pepys' affair solved] BBC News 24 14 October 2006</ref> Pepys also had a habit of fondling the breasts of his maid Mary Mercer while she dressed him in the morning.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bryson|first= Bill|date= 2010|title= At Home|url= |location= Canada|publisher= Anchor Random House|page= 123|isbn= 978-0385661645|author-link= Bill Bryson|quote= Of one maid, Mary Mercer, the Dictionary of National Biography serenely notes: \u201cSamuel seems to have made a habit of fondling Mercer\u2019s breasts while she dressed him in the morning\u201d\u2026When they weren\u2019t dressing him, absorbing his blows, or providing roosts for his gropes, Pepys' servants were expected to comb his hair and wash his ears.}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Mary Knep|Mrs Knep]] was the wife of a [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] horsedealer, and the mistress of Pepys\"\u2014or at least \"she granted him a share of her favours\".<ref>Peter Cunningham, ''The Story of Nell Gwyn'', Gordon Goodwin, ed., Edinburgh, John Grant, 1908; pp. 12, 171.</ref> Scholars disagree on the full extent of the Pepys/Knep relationship, but much of later generations' knowledge of Knep comes from the diary. Pepys first met Knep on 6 December 1665. He described her as \"pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life.\" He called her husband \"an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow\"<ref>Pepys' Diary entry of 8 December 1665.</ref> and suspected him of abusing his wife. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip. When they wrote notes to each other, Pepys signed himself \"Dapper Dickey\", while Knep was \"[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbry Allen]]\" (that popular song was an item in her musical repertory).\n\n===Text of the diary===\nThe diary was written in one of the many standard forms of [[shorthand]] used in Pepys' time, in this case called tachygraphy and devised by [[Thomas Shelton (stenographer)|Thomas Shelton]]. It is clear from its content that it was written as a purely personal record of his life and not for publication, yet there are indications that Pepys took steps to preserve the bound manuscripts of his diary. He wrote it out in fair copy from rough notes, and he also had the loose pages bound into six volumes, catalogued them in his library with all his other books, and is likely to have suspected that eventually someone would find them interesting.\n\n=== Simplified Pepys family tree ===\nThis tree resumes, in a more compact form and with a few additional details, trees published elsewhere in a box-like form.<ref name=\"Tomalin (2002) p6-7\">Tomalin (2002), {{p.|xii-xiii}}.</ref><ref name=\"Latham & Matthews (1970-83) Vol. X - Companion\">Latham & Matthews (1970\u201383), Vol. X \u2013 Companion.</ref> It is meant to help the reader of the ''Diary'' and also integrates some biographical informations found in the same sources.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background:LightBlue; text-align:center;\n|title=Simplified Pepys family tree}}\n{{Tree list}}\n* '''William Pepys''' of Cottenham (Cambs.) <small>(? \u2013 1519)</small>\n** '''Thomas Pepys'''\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Richard Pepys''' <small>(? \u2013 ''c.'' 1571)</small>\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''William Pepys''' of Norwich, ''draper'' <small>(1561 \u2013 ''c.'' 1639)</small>\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Richard Pepys''' of London, ''upholsterer'' <small>(? \u2013 1679)</small>\n** '''John Pepys''' of South Creak (Norf.) <small>(? \u2013 1542)</small>\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Thomas Pepys''' <small>(? \u2013 1569)</small>\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Jerome Pepys''' <small>(1548\u20131634)</small>\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''John Pepys''' of Ashtead (Surrey), ''man of business to Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]]'' <small>(1576\u20131652)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+<small>(1610)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Anne Walpole'''\n****** '''Edward Pepys''' of Broomsthorpe (Norf.), ''lawyer'' <small>(1617\u20131663)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Elizabeth Walpole'''\n****** '''Elizabeth Pepys'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Thomas Dyke'''\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Jane Pepys (\u201cMadam Turner\u201d)''' <small>(1623\u20131686)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+<small>(1650)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''John Turner''', ''Yorkshire lawyer'' <small>(1631\u20131689)</small>\n******* '''Charles Turner'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Margaret Cholmley'''\n******* '''Theophila Turner (\u201cThe\u201d)''' <small>(1652\u20131702)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+<small>(1673)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet, of Stowford]]''', ''M.P. for Okehampton'' <small>(''c.'' 1650 \u2013 1686)</small>\n******* '''William Turner'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Foulis'''\n******* {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Elizabeth Turner (\u201cBetty\u201d)'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''William Hooker'''\n** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''William Pepys''' of Cottenham (Cambs.)\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''John Pepys''' of Cottenham and Impington (Cambs.) <small>(? \u2013 1589)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''? ?'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Edith Talbot''' <small>(? \u2013 1583)</small>\n**** '''John Pepys'''<sup>&nbsp;1</sup> <small>(? \u2013 1604)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Elizabeth Bendish''' of Essex\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''[[Richard Pepys|Sir Richard Pepys]]''', ''M.P. for Sudbury and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland'' <small>(1589\u20131659)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) +<small>(1620)</small>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Judith Cutte'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Gosnold'''\n****** '''Richard Pepys'''  of Ashen (Essex), ''lawyer'' <small>(? \u2013 1664)</small>\n****** '''Samuel Pepys''' of Dublin, ''clergyman''\n****** '''Elizabeth Pepys'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Thomas Strudwick''', ''confectioner''\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Judith Pepys''' <small>(? \u2013 1664)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Benjamin Scott''', ''pewterer'' <small>(? \u2013 1664)</small>\n**** '''Thomas Pepys (\u201cthe Black\u201d)'''<sup>&nbsp;1</sup> <small>(? \u2013 1606)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Day'''\n***** '''Robert Pepys''' of Brampton (Hunts.), ''bailiff at Hinchingbrooke'' <small>(? \u2013 1661)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Anne, widow Trice'''\n***** '''Thomas Pepys''' of St Alphage <small>(1595\u20131676)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''Mary Syvret [Chiveret]'''\n****** '''Thomas Pepys (\u201cthe turner\u201d)''', ''trader with the W.

In 1675 he was appointed a Governor of Christ's Hospital and for many years he took a close interest in its affairs. Among his papers are two detailed memoranda on the administration of the school. In 1699, after the successful conclusion of a seven-year campaign to get the master of the Mathematical School replaced by a man who knew more about the sea, he was rewarded for his service as a Governor by being made a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]]. He also served as Master (without ever having been a Freeman or Liveryman) of the [[Clothworkers' Company]] (1677-8).\n\nAt the beginning of 1679 Pepys was elected MP for [[Harwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Harwich]] in Charles II's third parliament which formed part of the [[Cavalier Parliament]]. He was elected along with [[Anthony Deane (mayor)|Sir Anthony Deane]], a Harwich alderman and leading naval architect, to whom Pepys had been patron since 1662. By May of that year, they were under attack from their political enemies. Pepys resigned as Secretary to the Admiralty. They were imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] on suspicion of treasonable correspondence with France, specifically leaking naval intelligence. The charges are believed to have been fabricated under the direction of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatley|1893}} \"Shaftesbury and the others not having succeeded in getting at Pepys through his clerk, soon afterwards attacked him more directly, using the infamous evidence of Colonel Scott\"</ref> Pepys was accused, among other things, of being a papist.

The phantom [[Pepys Island]], alleged to be near [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], was named after him in 1684, having been first \"discovered\" during his tenure at the Admiralty.\n\nFrom 1685 to 1688, he was active not only as Secretary for the Admiralty, but also as MP for Harwich. He had been elected MP for [[Sandwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Sandwich]], but this election was contested and he immediately withdrew to Harwich. When James fled the country at the end of 1688, Pepys' career also came to an end. In January 1689, he was defeated in the parliamentary election at Harwich; in February, one week after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], he resigned his secretaryship.\n\n===Royal Society===\n[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isaac Newton]]'s personal copy of the first edition of his ''Principia Mathematica'', bearing Pepys' name]]\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1665 and served as its President from 1 December 1684 to 30 November 1686. [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' was published during this period, and its title page bears Pepys' name.

He moved out of London ten years later (1701) to a house in [[Clapham]] owned by his friend [[William Hewer]], who had begun his career working for Pepys in the admiralty.<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Pepys |last2=Latham |first2=Robert |last3=Matthews |first3=William |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-JSalViBrMC&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=%22robert+blackborne%22+anne#PPA182,M1 |title=The Diary of Samuel Pepys: A New and Complete Transcription, Volume 10 (Footnote on Will Hewer) |publisher=University of California Press |date=2001 |page=182 |isbn=9780520227156 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> Clapham was in the country at the time; it is now part of inner London.\n\nPepys lived there until his death on 26 May 1703. He had no children and bequeathed his estate to his unmarried nephew John Jackson. Pepys had disinherited his nephew Samuel Jackson for marrying contrary to his wishes. When John Jackson died in 1724, Pepys' estate reverted to Anne, daughter of Archdeacon Samuel Edgeley, niece of Will Hewer and sister of Hewer Edgeley, nephew and godson of Pepys' old Admiralty employee and friend Will Hewer. Hewer was also childless and left his immense estate to his nephew Hewer Edgeley (consisting mostly of the Clapham property, as well as lands in Clapham, London, Westminster and Norfolk) on condition that the nephew (and godson) would adopt the surname Hewer. So Will Hewer's heir became Hewer Edgeley-Hewer, and he adopted the old Will Hewer home in Clapham as his residence. That is how the Edgeley family acquired the estates of both Samuel Pepys and Will Hewer, sister Anne inheriting Pepys' estate, and brother Hewer inheriting that of Will Hewer. On the death of Hewer Edgeley-Hewer in 1728, the old Hewer estate went to Edgeley-Hewer's widow Elizabeth, who left the {{convert|432|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} estate to Levett Blackborne, the son of Abraham Blackborne, merchant of Clapham, and other family members, who later sold it off in lots. Lincoln's Inn barrister Levett Blackborne also later acted as attorney in legal scuffles for the heirs who had inherited the Pepys estate.\n\nPepys' former [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] and friend Hewer acted as the executor of Pepys' estate.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gyq6euwfZj8C&pg=RA2-PA271&lpg=RA2-PA271&dq=%22hewer+edgeley#PRA2-PA271,M1\n  |title=Will Hewer, The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Samuel Pepys, 1899\n|last1=Pepys\n|first1=Samuel\n|year=1899\n}}</ref>\n\nPepys was buried along with his wife in [[St Olave's Church, Hart Street]] in London.\n\n==Pepys Library==\n{{Main|Pepys Library}}\n\n[[File:PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Pepys Library|Pepys Building]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]]]\n[[File:Pepys Library c1870.jpg|thumb|Pepys Library c. 1870]]\n\nPepys was a lifelong [[bibliophile]] and carefully nurtured his large collection of books, manuscripts, and prints. At his death, there were more than 3,000 volumes, including the diary, all carefully catalogued and indexed; they form one of the most important surviving 17th-century private [[library|libraries]]. The most important items in the Library are the six original bound manuscripts of Pepys' diary, but there are other remarkable holdings, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/pepys/collection.html|title=Pepys Library Website|work=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=17 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302200832/http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/pepys/collection.html|archivedate=2 March 2000|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* [[Incunabula]] by [[William Caxton]], [[Wynkyn de Worde]], and [[Richard Pynson]]\n* Sixty medieval manuscripts\n* The ''[[Pepys Manuscript]]'', a late-15th-century English [[choirbook]]\n* Naval records such as two of the '[[Anthony Roll]]s', illustrating the Royal Navy's ships c. 1546, including the ''[[Mary Rose]]''\n* [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s personal [[almanac]]\n* Over 1,800 printed [[ballads]], one of the finest collections in existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emc.english.ucsb.edu/ballad_project/|title=UCSB English Broadside Ballad Archive|work=ucsb.edu|accessdate=17 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114221738/http://emc.english.ucsb.edu/ballad_project/|archivedate=14 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nPepys made detailed provisions in his will for the preservation of his book collection. His nephew and heir John Jackson died in 1723, when it was transferred intact to [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where it can be seen in the [[Pepys Library|Pepys Building]].

He laboured at this task for three years, from 1819 to 1822, unaware until nearly finished that a key to the shorthand system was stored in Pepys' library a few shelves above the diary volumes. Others had apparently succeeded in reading the diary earlier, perhaps knowing about the key, because a work of 1812 quotes from a passage of it.<ref name=\"Bryson2010pp211-212\">{{citation |last=Bryson |first=Bill |title=At home: a short history of private life |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0385533591 |pages=211\u2013212 |postscript=.}}</ref> Smith's transcription, which is also kept in the [[Pepys Library]], was the basis for the first published edition of the diary, edited by [[Lord Braybrooke]], released in two volumes in 1825.\n\nA second transcription, done with the benefit of the key, but often less accurately, was completed in 1875 by Mynors Bright and published in 1875\u20131879.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pepys.info |title= Samuel Pepys Diary }}</ref> This added about a third to the previously published text, but still left only about 80% of the diary in print.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wheatley |first=Henry |title=Diary of Samuel Pepys |url=https://archive.org/details/diaryofsamuelpep05pepy |year=1893 |publisher=Geo.

Wheatley, in the preface to his edition noted, \"a few passages which cannot possibly be printed. It may be thought by some that these omissions are due to an unnecessary squeamishness, but it is not really so, and readers are therefore asked to have faith in the judgement of the editor.\"\n\nThe complete, unexpurgated, and definitive edition, edited and transcribed by [[Robert Latham (editor)|Robert Latham]]<!-- NOT Robert Gordon Latham --> and William Matthews, was published by Bell & Hyman, London, and the [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, in nine volumes, along with separate Companion and Index volumes, over the years 1970\u20131983. Various single-volume abridgements of this text are also available.\n\nThe Introduction in volume I provides a scholarly but readable account of \"The Diarist\", \"The Diary\" (\"The Manuscript\", \"The Shorthand\", and \"The Text\"), \"History of Previous Editions\", \"The Diary as Literature\", and \"The Diary as History\". The Companion provides a long series of detailed essays about Pepys and his world.\n\nThe first unabridged recording of the diary as an audiobook was published in 2015 by ''Naxos AudioBooks''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gyford |first=Phil |url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/news/2014/12/18/14017/ |title=New unabridged diary audiobook in 2015 |date=4 August 2011 |website=www.pepysdiary.com |publisher=Pepys Diary |access-date=18 September 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 2003 Phil Gyford started a [[weblog]], pepysdiary.com, that serialised the diary one day each evening together with annotations from public and experts alike.

In 2003 a television film ''[[The Private Life of Samuel Pepys]]'' aired on [[BBC2]]. [[Steve Coogan]] played Pepys. The 2004 film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' concerns London theatre in the 17th century and is based on [[Jeffrey Hatcher]]'s play ''Compleat Female Stage Beauty'', which in turn was inspired by a reference in Pepys' diary to the actor [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]], who played female roles in the days when women were forbidden to appear on stage. Pepys is a character in the film and is portrayed as an ardent devotee of the theatre. [[Hugh Bonneville]] plays Pepys. [[Daniel Mays]] portrays Pepys in [[The Great Fire (miniseries)|''The Great Fire'']], a 2014 BBC television miniseries. Pepys has also been portrayed in various other film and television productions, played by diverse actors including [[Mervyn Johns]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Michael Graham Cox]] and [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]].\n\n[[BBC Radio 4]] has broadcast serialised radio dramatisations of the diary. In the 1990s it was performed as a ''Classic Serial'' starring [[Bill Nighy]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Anomymous |title=The Diary of Samuel Pepys: A Radio 4 Classic Serial (BBC Classic Collection) |date=3 Jan 1995 |publisher=BBC Audiobooks Ltd |quote=|id={{ASIN|0563390069|country=uk}} }}</ref> and in the 2010s it was serialised as part of the ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' radio magazine programme.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gyford |first=Phil |url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/news/2011/08/04/12801/ |title=New BBC Pepys radio drama |date=4 August 2011 |website=www.pepysdiary.com |publisher=Pepys Diary |access-date=18 September 2015 |quote=}}</ref> One audiobook edition of Pepys' diary selections is narrated by [[Kenneth Branagh]]. A fictionalised Pepys narrates the second chapter of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s science fiction novel ''[[A Different Flesh]]'' (serialised 1985\u20131988, book form 1988). This chapter is entitled \"And So to Bed\" and written in the form of entries from the Pepys diary. The entries detail Pepys' encounter with American ''[[Homo erectus]]'' specimens (imported to London as beasts of burden) and his formation of the \"transformational theory of life\", thus causing [[evolutionary theory]] to gain a foothold in scientific thought in the 17th century rather than the 19th. [[Deborah Swift]]'s 2017 novel ''Pleasing Mr Pepys'' is described as a \"re-imagining of the events in Samuel Pepys's Diary\".<ref name=\"pleasing\">{{cite web|title=Pleasing Mr Pepys|url=http://www.deborahswift.com/book/pleasing-mr-pepys/|publisher=Deborah Swift|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Biographical studies==\n[[File:Samuel Pepys pub.jpg|thumb|right|This pub in Mayfair was named after Pepys; it closed in 2008.]]\nSeveral detailed studies of Pepys' life are available. [[Arthur Bryant]] published his three-volume study in 1933\u20131938, long before the definitive edition of the diary, but, thanks to Bryant's lively style, it is still of interest. In 1974 [[Richard Ollard]] produced a new biography that drew on Latham's and Matthew's work on the text, benefitting from the author's deep knowledge of Restoration politics. Other biographies include: ''Samuel Pepys: A Life'', by Stephen Coote (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2000) and, ''Samuel Pepys and His World'', by Geoffrey Trease (London: Thames and Hudson, 1972).\n\nThe most recent general study is by [[Claire Tomalin]], which won the [[Whitbread Book Awards|2002 Whitbread Book of the Year]] award, the judges calling it a \"rich, thoughtful and deeply satisfying\" account that unearths \"a wealth of material about the uncharted life of Samuel Pepys\".{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Evelyn]] \u2013 contemporary diarist\n*[[Rota Club]]\n*[[Samuel Pepys Club]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|35em}}\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Bryant |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Bryant |year=1933 |title=Samuel Pepys (I: The man in the making.
