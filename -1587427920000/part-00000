{"title_page": "Chief inspector", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}\n'''Chief inspector''' ('''Ch Insp''') is a [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]] used in [[police]] forces which follow the [[British police|British]] model. In countries outside Britain, it is sometimes referred to as '''chief inspector of police''' ('''CIP''').\n==Usage by Country==\n===Australia===\nThe rank of chief inspector is used in the [[New South Wales Police]] and [[South Australia Police]]. [[Victoria Police]] declassified the rank in the mid-1990s. In both forces, it is senior to the rank of [[inspector]] and junior to the rank of [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]]. The insignia consists of a crown, the same insignia as that of a [[Major]] in the army.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], a chief inspector is normally the second-in-command of a headquarters unit or a [[Police division|division]].\n\n===Japan===\n\nIn the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|Japanese National Police Agency]], a chief inspector (\u8b66\u90e8 keibu) serves as the squad commander in a police station and leader of a riot company. Prior to a 2013 restructuring that changed the English translation slightly, this rank was that of inspector.\n\n===Papua New Guinea===\n\nIn the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]], a chief inspector is normally a police station commander or the second-in-command of the Police Training College. It is a rank between [[senior inspector]] and [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]].\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief inspector is a rank in the [[Bureau of Jail Management and Penology]] and the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]]. It is above senior inspector and below superintendent and is regarded as the equivalent of [[major]] in the [[Philippine Army]].\n\n===Romania===\nIn the [[Romanian Police#Ranks|Romanian Police]], '''inspector principal''' is a rank senior to [[Inspector#Romania|inspector]] and junior to ''Subcomisar'' and corresponds to the former rank of [[police captain]].\n\n===Singapore===\nThe rank has been abolished by the [[Singapore Police Force]], except for the [[Gurkha Contingent]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn the [[Sri Lanka Police Service]], chief inspector of Police (CIP) is senior to [[Inspector#Sri Lanka|inspector]] and junior to [[Assistant Superintendent#Sri Lanka|assistant superintendent of police]]. In large cities, a chief inspector is the officer in charge (OIC) of a large [[police station]]. The rank insignia for a chief inspector is three stars.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n [[File:CInsp.svg|UK police chief inspector epaulette|thumb|100px|right]]\nIn the British police, a chief inspector is senior to an inspector and junior to a [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]].\n\nToday, the function of chief inspectors varies from force to force. They may assist [[Basic Command Unit]] (BCU) commanders, command smaller units, or fill various staff posts. In some forces such as [[Hampshire Constabulary]] and [[Sussex Police]], the chief inspector is the senior officer in command of a district (usually consisting of one or more local authority areas). In this respect they have replaced superintendents as the head police officer of the larger towns.\n\n'''Detective chief inspector''' (DCI) is usually the minimum rank held by a senior investigating officer (SIO), who heads major investigations (e.g. [[murder]]), and a pool of these officers usually works out of force headquarters or major [[police station]]s. The senior Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officer in each BCU usually also holds this rank.\n\nThe rank badge of a chief inspector is three [[Bath stars]] (\"pips\") worn on the [[epaulette]]s. This is the same badge as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[British Army]]. Until 1953, chief inspectors in the Metropolitan Police wore a crown on their epaulettes instead.\n\nChief inspector was one of the ranks proposed for abolition in the [[Sheehy Inquiry|1994 Sheehy Report]], but in the end it was retained.\n\nA number of city and burgh police forces in [[Scotland]] used the rank of '''lieutenant''' until 1948, when it was replaced by chief inspector.<ref>Report of the Committee of Inquiry on the Police, 1978</ref>\n\n==Metropolitan Police==\nThe rank was introduced into the [[Metropolitan Police]] in 1868 and was first used by [[Adolphus Williamson]], the first head of the Detective Branch (later the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]). When Williamson was promoted to superintendent shortly afterwards, three of his [[inspector]]s were promoted to chief inspector and the rank was firmly established. In 1869 it was also introduced as a uniformed rank, with the senior assistant to the [[Police division|division]]al superintendent being given the rank. The rank subsequently spread to other police forces.\n\nFrom 1933, every Metropolitan Police division had two chief inspectors: chief inspector (administration) and chief inspector (crime) (the latter also being a uniformed administrative officer and not replacing the [[divisional detective inspector]] (DDI)). From 1949, [[sub-divisional inspector]]s and DDIs were regraded as chief inspectors and current chief inspectors were regraded as superintendents. From 1953, chief inspectors commanding sub-divisions and detective chief inspectors commanding divisional CIDs were regraded as superintendents grade I, other chief inspectors were regraded as superintendents grade II, and a redefined rank of chief inspector was created for senior inspectors. Since 1974, the Metropolitan Police has only had one rank of superintendent, in common with the rest of the country.\n\nFrom January 1954, there was one superintendent grade I and one chief inspector in each sub-division, and one chief superintendent, one superintendent grade II and one detective superintendent grade I in each division.<ref>Report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the Year 1953</ref> A detective chief inspector was added in each division later in 1954.<ref>Report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the Year 1954</ref>\n\nIt was announced in October 2016 that the rank (along with the rank of commander) would be phased out of the Metropolitan Police Service by October 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.met.police.uk/news/met-police-to-modernise-its-rank-structure-191284|title=Met police to modernise its rank structure|author=|date=|website=met.police.uk|access-date=2016-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120161342/http://news.met.police.uk/news/met-police-to-modernise-its-rank-structure-191284|archive-date=2017-11-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> however this plan has now been cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.policeoracle.com/news/HR_personnel_and_staff_development/2017/Aug/17/met-cancels-plans-to-abolish-two-ranks_95557.html|title=Met cancels plans to abolish two ranks - UK Police News - Police Oracle|author=|date=|website=www.policeoracle.com}}</ref>\n\n==Salary==\nA chief inspector's starting salary is \u00a355,521, or \u00a357,732 if serving in London.

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of [[secularism]]) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018).

The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u20138, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere in the wake of the Great Recession.

They found that 20% of the establishments hailed from rural areas compared to 30% from urban areas. In addition, large innovative firms were more likely to be found in rural areas while small and medium firms tended to come from the metropolitan areas. This is because large patent-intensive manufacturing firms \u2013 such as those manufacturing chemicals, electronic components, automotive parts, or medical equipment \u2013 were generally based in rural areas while those that provide services tend to cluster in the cities.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995.

This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005.

A nominal tuition fee of \u00a31,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case.

Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There is, however, a widening gender gap.

The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies.

Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other \u2013 one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course \u2013 and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>\n\n== Historical knowledge ==\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on|title=Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is|date=April 12, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2&nbsp;million [[Jews]] or fewer were killed during [[the Holocaust]], and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holocaust-study-millennials/|title=4 in 10 millennials don't know 6 million Jews were killed in Holocaust, study shows|date=12 April 2018|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the [[Baltic states]], which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single [[List of Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] or ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claimscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Holocaust-Knowledge-Awareness-Study_Executive-Summary-2018.pdf|title=Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness Study|website=www.claimscon.org|publisher=Schoen Consulting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.claimscon.org/study|title=New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States|date=2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qrUxE|archivedate=12 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=Claims Conference}}</ref> However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html|title=Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds|last1=Astor|first1=Maggie|date=12 April 2018|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uaSVa|archivedate=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}</ref>\n\nThe [[YouGov]] survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of [[Mao Zedong]], who ruled [[China]] from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20\u201345&nbsp;million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-millennials-desperately-need-to-bone-up-on-the-history-of-communism-2016-10-17|title=Poll: Millennials desperately need to bone up on the history of communism|date=21 October 2016|work=MarketWatch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/young-americans-seen-less-opposed-to-socialist-ideas/3562681.html|title=Poll Finds Young Americans More Open to Socialist Ideas|date=23 October 2016|work=VOA News}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and participation ==\n\n=== American millennials ===\n[[File:US teens political views (Gallup 2004).png|400x400px|alt=|right]]\nA 2004 Gallup poll of Americans aged 13 to 17 found that 71% said their social and political views were more or less the same as those of their parents. 21% thought they were more liberal and 7% more conservative.

Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters \u2013 Millennials \u2013 entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6: De-alignment}}</ref>\n\nBut scholars such as [[Ronald Inglehart]] traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century \u2013 the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation \u2013 who had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution.\" But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution.\"<ref name=\":30\" /> The university-educated and non-degree holders have very different upbringing, live very different lives, and as such hold very different values.<ref name=\":37\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|pages=|chapter=Chapter 3: Distrust}}</ref> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights, and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions.<ref name=\":32\" /> While the number of university-educated Western voters continues to grow, in many democracies non-degree holders still form a large share of the electorate. According to the OECD, in 2016, the average share of voters between the ages of 25 and 64 without tertiary education in the European Union was 66% of the population. In Italy, it exceeded 80%. In many major democracies, such as France, although the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the corridors of power has increased, the same cannot be said for the working-class and non-degree holders.<ref name=\":37\" />\n\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap. In Austria, more than one in two men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] in 2016. The [[Alternative for Germany]]'s strongest support came not from senior citizens but voters between 25 and 50 years of age.

But when various factors \u2013 including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location \u2013 were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/millennial-car-ownership-driving-behavior-vehicle-data/585667/|title=Despite 'Car-Free' Hype, Millennials Drive a Lot|last=Bliss|first=Laura|date=March 27, 2019|work=CityLab|access-date=November 3, 2019|department=Transportation}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, young people are more likely to ride [[Public transportation in the United States|public transit]].

Immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth in Europe. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society.

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents.

The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u20138, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005.

A nominal tuition fee of \u00a31,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case.

Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There is, however, a widening gender gap.

The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies.

Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other \u2013 one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course \u2013 and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>\n\n== Historical knowledge ==\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on|title=Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is|date=April 12, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2&nbsp;million [[Jews]] or fewer were killed during [[the Holocaust]], and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holocaust-study-millennials/|title=4 in 10 millennials don't know 6 million Jews were killed in Holocaust, study shows|date=12 April 2018|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the [[Baltic states]], which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single [[List of Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] or ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claimscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Holocaust-Knowledge-Awareness-Study_Executive-Summary-2018.pdf|title=Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness Study|website=www.claimscon.org|publisher=Schoen Consulting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.claimscon.org/study|title=New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States|date=2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qrUxE|archivedate=12 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=Claims Conference}}</ref> However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html|title=Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds|last1=Astor|first1=Maggie|date=12 April 2018|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uaSVa|archivedate=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}</ref>\n\nThe [[YouGov]] survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of [[Mao Zedong]], who ruled [[China]] from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20\u201345&nbsp;million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-millennials-desperately-need-to-bone-up-on-the-history-of-communism-2016-10-17|title=Poll: Millennials desperately need to bone up on the history of communism|date=21 October 2016|work=MarketWatch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/young-americans-seen-less-opposed-to-socialist-ideas/3562681.html|title=Poll Finds Young Americans More Open to Socialist Ideas|date=23 October 2016|work=VOA News}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and participation ==\n\n=== American millennials ===\n[[File:US teens political views (Gallup 2004).png|400x400px|alt=|right]]\nA 2004 Gallup poll of Americans aged 13 to 17 found that 71% said their social and political views were more or less the same as those of their parents. 21% thought they were more liberal and 7% more conservative.

Although people between the ages of 25 and 44 were more likely to vote, their turnout rate followed a similarly declining trend during the same period.

Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] argued because about one quarter of Democrat supporters held social views more in-tune with Republican voters and because there was no guarantee Millennials would maintain their current political attitudes due to life-cycle effects, this process of political re-alignment would likely continue.

In 2016, 47% of young whites said they would vote for the Democratic Party, compared to 33% for the Republican Party, a gap of 14% in favor of the Democrats. But in 2018, that gap vanished, and the corresponding numbers were 39% for each party. For young white men the shift was even more dramatic. In 2016, 48% said they would vote for the Democratic Party and 36% for the Republican Party. But by 2018, those numbers were 37% and 46%, respectively.

Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters \u2013 Millennials \u2013 entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders.

Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century \u2013 the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation \u2013 who had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution.\" But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution.\"<ref name=\":30\" /> The university-educated and non-degree holders have very different upbringing, live very different lives, and as such hold very different values.<ref name=\":37\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|pages=|chapter=Chapter 3: Distrust}}</ref> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset.

According to the OECD, in 2016, the average share of voters between the ages of 25 and 64 without tertiary education in the European Union was 66% of the population. In Italy, it exceeded 80%. In many major democracies, such as France, although the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the corridors of power has increased, the same cannot be said for the working-class and non-degree holders.<ref name=\":37\" />\n\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap.

But when various factors \u2013 including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location \u2013 were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/millennial-car-ownership-driving-behavior-vehicle-data/585667/|title=Despite 'Car-Free' Hype, Millennials Drive a Lot|last=Bliss|first=Laura|date=March 27, 2019|work=CityLab|access-date=November 3, 2019|department=Transportation}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, young people are more likely to ride [[Public transportation in the United States|public transit]].

According to a 2007 study, across Europe, many young Muslims were finding themselves attracted by transnational Islam; those under the age of 25 were more likely to support Muslim-only schools, and Sharia law, and to condone violence to defend their religion than their counterparts over the age of 55. Immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth in Europe. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. Religion can indeed grow even in otherwise secular societies, and such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nA 2017 study conducted by the Pew Research Center on 70 countries showed that between 2010 and 2015, among people aged 15 to 29, the irreligious grew by 23%, Muslims 0.3%, while Christians lost 0.7% due to religious conversion or switching.

Hounslow is identified as a major metropolitan centre in the [[London Plan]]. It is located near [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]] and is about {{convert|10.7|mi|km|1|abbr=}} west-southwest of [[Charing Cross]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} south-east of [[Slough]], {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of [[Southall]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} north-west of [[Twickenham]], and {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} north-east of [[Staines-upon-Thames]].\n\nHounslow has a large shopping centre, called the Treaty Centre, which adjoins its high street and many restaurants, caf\u00e9s and small businesses, many of which are associated with product assembly, marketing, telecommunications and [[Heathrow Airport]]. It is connected to [[Central London]] by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]]'s [[Hounslow Loop Line]] and [[Hounslow railway station|Hounslow station]], and by the [[London Underground]]'s [[Piccadilly line]] through three stations - [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]], [[Hounslow Central tube station|Hounslow Central]] and [[Hounslow East tube station|Hounslow East]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Hounslow is spelt in old records as 'Hundeslow' and similar, pointing to [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Hundes hl\u0101w'', meaning \"the dog's mound\" or \"the mound of a man named or nicknamed Hound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[Hounslow Heath]] has strategic importance as routes from London to the west and southwest of Britain used to pass through it. Staines Road, the northern boundary of the present Heath, was the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman Road]], ''Trinobantes''. There are several historic references to Roman camps on or close to the Heath. The military connection has continued with both [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[James II of England|James II]] using it as a military encampment and the construction in 1793 of the [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow|Cavalry Barracks]]. The barracks were extended with [[Beavers Lane Camp]] and from 1914-20 the Heath became [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]]. In 1902 the [[Hanworth Road drill hall, Hounslow|Hanworth Road drill hall]] (now the Treaty Lodge Hotel) was built for the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment.\n\nThe Heath has a continuous recorded history dating back to [[Norman conquest of England|Norman]] times, where it gave its name to the former hamlet of [[Heathrow (hamlet)|Heathrow]]. Hounslow Heath was also known for the extremely high numbers of [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] and [[footpad]]s in the area,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stand-and-deliver.org.uk/hounslow_heath.htm|title=Hounslow Heath - Highwaymen and Highway Robbery|website=www.stand-and-deliver.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> who mostly focused on targeting the wealthy and noble.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://londonist.com/london/history/when-hounslow-was-the-most-dangerous-place-in-london|title=When Hounslow Was The Most Dangerous Place In Britain|date=2017-01-13|work=Londonist|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}</ref> \n\nPositioned on the [[A4 road (England)|Bath Road]] (where it forks to the Staines Road at the Bell Inn), Hounslow was centred around Holy Trinity Priory founded in 1211.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45431 Daniel Lysons, 'Heston', ''The Environs of London'': volume 3: ''County of Middlesex'' (1795:22\u201345):] accessed 6 August 2010.</ref> The priory developed what had been a small village into a town with regular markets and other facilities for travellers heading to and from London. Although the priory was dissolved in 1539 the town remained an important staging post on the Bath Road. \n\nThe building of the [[Great Western Railway]] line from London to Bristol from 1838 reduced long-distance travel along the Bath Road. By 1842 the local paper was reporting that the 'formerly flourishing village', which used to stable 2,000 horses, was suffering a 'general depreciation of property'.<ref>Quoted in Acworth, WM 'The Railways in 1843' in Morgan, B (1963) Railway Lover's Companion, Eyre & Spottiswoode, P90</ref> The [[Hounslow Loop Line]] was constructed in 1850, prompting new development. [[Hounslow Hospital]] opened in 1876 and closed in 1978, despite being occupied in protest at the closure.\n\nThe construction of the [[A4 road (England)|Great West Road]] (a revival of an earlier name for the Bath Road as a by-pass for it around the north of Brentford, Isleworth and Hounslow centres) in the 1920s attracted the building of the factories and headquarters of large companies. The factories were a great local source of employment until a decline in the 1970s, attracting workers from a wide area and leading to a great deal of housing development. In the next two decades offices largely replaced factories on the Great West Road and further expansion in hotel and housing stock has taken place, an example being the Blenheim Centre, an image of which is in the [[Hounslow#Gallery|gallery]] section below.\n\n== Governance ==\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Middlesex]], since 1965 Hounslow has been part of the London Borough of Hounslow, with parts in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]], and [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]]. Prior to this, Hounslow was part of the [[Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth]], from 1835 until 1965.

The east-west roads, the [[A4 road (England)|A4]] 'Great West Road' and the 'Bath Road' that connects Hounslow to [[Central London]] and [[Slough]], and the [[A30 road|A30]] 'Great South West Road' that connects it to [[Staines-upon-Thames]], which meet at Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West. There is also the north-south road, the [[A312 road|A312]] 'The Causeway' and 'The Parkway', which connects Hounslow to [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] in the south and [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] to the north.\n\nAdditionally, A and B roads in Hounslow include the A314 'Hanworth Road' that starts in Hounslow and finishes is [[Hanworth]], [[Feltham]]. The historic A315 'London Road', 'Hounslow High Street', 'Hanworth Road', 'Grove Road' and 'Staines Road';  which starts in Central London down to [[Bedfont]], Feltham. In doing this, it connects Hounslow to towns and districts such as Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Brentford and Isleworth.\n\n===East-west roads===\nThe [[A4 road (England)|A4 Great West Road]] joins with the [[A3006 road (Great Britain)|A3006]] Bath Road (from the A315) before Henlys Roundabout, which is in Hounslow West, from which a [[Boxing the compass|WNW]] route passes [[Heathrow Airport]], terminals 1 to 3 and terminal 5 as the ''Bath Road'' and a WSW route, the [[A30 road (Great Britain)|A30]], passes terminal 4, bypasses [[Staines]] and reaches the [[M25 motorway|M25]]; the remainder is a mostly-minor route to [[Land's End]], Cornwall.\n\nThe [[M4 motorway]] is two miles north; its nearest junction, J3, being northwest along the [[Hounslow#Transport#North-South roads|A312]].\n\nThe A315 is the historic WSW road out of London, on which Hounslow's High Street is placed. To the east, it bisects [[Isleworth]], [[Brentford]] and [[Chiswick]]. To the west it bisects [[Feltham|North Feltham]] and [[East Bedfont|Bedfont]] before joining the A30.\n\n===North-south roads===\nThe north-south [[A312 road (Great Britain)|A312]], ''The Parkway'', to the west of Hounslow leads south to [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] or north to [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] passing Waggoners' Roundabout (WNW of Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West), [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Yeading]] and [[Northolt]].\n\nThree minor roads converge on [[Heston]] from the A315 in parts of Hounslow, the A3063, A3005 and B363. The single road re-divides just north in [[Norwood Green]] into a northwest road to [[Southall]] (the A3005) and into the [[A4127 road (Great Britain)|A4127]] that passes by [[Hanwell]], briefly using the [[A4020 road (Great Britain)|A4020]] west before bypassing [[Dormers Wells]], passing [[Greenford]] to reach [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], the town immediately to the west of [[Wembley]] and [[North Wembley]].\n\nFor longer journeys north, the M4, A4 or A30 then M25 provides the best routes. For longer journeys south, Hanworth Road leads to the [[A316 road (Great Britain)|A316]] that becomes the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]].\n\n===Trains and Underground===\n[[Image:Hounslow Central westbound.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hounslow Central tube station]]]]\nThere are three main London Underground stations in the town; [[Hounslow East tube station|Hounslow East]], [[Hounslow Central tube station|Hounslow Central]] and [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]], with all the stations being on the [[Piccadilly line]].

Hounslow is identified as a major metropolitan centre in the [[London Plan]]. It is located near [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]] and is about {{convert|10.7|mi|km|1|abbr=}} west-southwest of [[Charing Cross]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} south-east of [[Slough]], {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of [[Southall]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} north-west of [[Twickenham]], and {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} north-east of [[Staines-upon-Thames]].\n\nHounslow has a large shopping centre, called the Treaty Centre, which adjoins its high street and many restaurants, caf\u00e9s and small businesses, many of which are associated with product assembly, marketing, telecommunications and [[Heathrow Airport]]. It is connected to [[Central London]] by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]]'s [[Hounslow Loop Line]] and [[Hounslow railway station|Hounslow station]], and by the [[London Underground]]'s [[Piccadilly line]] through three stations - [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]], [[Hounslow Central tube station|Hounslow Central]] and [[Hounslow East tube station|Hounslow East]]. \n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Hounslow is spelt in old records as 'Hundeslow' and similar, pointing to [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Hundes hl\u0101w'', meaning \"the dog's mound\" or \"the mound of a man named or nicknamed Hound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[Hounslow Heath]] has strategic importance as routes from London to the west and southwest of Britain used to pass through it. Staines Road, the northern boundary of the present Heath, was the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman Road]], ''Trinobantes''. There are several historic references to Roman camps on or close to the Heath. The military connection has continued with both [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[James II of England|James II]] using it as a military encampment and the construction in 1793 of the [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow|Cavalry Barracks]]. The barracks were extended with [[Beavers Lane Camp]] and from 1914-20 the Heath became [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]]. In 1902 the [[Hanworth Road drill hall, Hounslow|Hanworth Road drill hall]] (now the Treaty Lodge Hotel) was built for the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment.\n\nThe Heath has a continuous recorded history dating back to [[Norman conquest of England|Norman]] times, where it gave its name to the former hamlet of [[Heathrow (hamlet)|Heathrow]]. Hounslow Heath was also known for the extremely high numbers of [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] and [[footpad]]s in the area,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stand-and-deliver.org.uk/hounslow_heath.htm|title=Hounslow Heath - Highwaymen and Highway Robbery|website=www.stand-and-deliver.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> who mostly focused on targeting the wealthy and noble.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://londonist.com/london/history/when-hounslow-was-the-most-dangerous-place-in-london|title=When Hounslow Was The Most Dangerous Place In Britain|date=2017-01-13|work=Londonist|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}</ref> \n\nPositioned on the [[A4 road (England)|Bath Road]] (where it forks to the Staines Road at the Bell Inn), Hounslow was centred around Holy Trinity Priory founded in 1211.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45431 Daniel Lysons, 'Heston', ''The Environs of London'': volume 3: ''County of Middlesex'' (1795:22\u201345):] accessed 6 August 2010.</ref> The priory developed what had been a small village into a town with regular markets and other facilities for travellers heading to and from London. Although the priory was dissolved in 1539 the town remained an important staging post on the Bath Road. \n\nThe building of the [[Great Western Railway]] line from London to Bristol from 1838 reduced long-distance travel along the Bath Road. By 1842 the local paper was reporting that the 'formerly flourishing village', which used to stable 2,000 horses, was suffering a 'general depreciation of property'.<ref>Quoted in Acworth, WM 'The Railways in 1843' in Morgan, B (1963) Railway Lover's Companion, Eyre & Spottiswoode, P90</ref> The [[Hounslow Loop Line]] was constructed in 1850, prompting new development. [[Hounslow Hospital]] opened in 1876 and closed in 1978, despite being occupied in protest at the closure.\n\nThe construction of the [[A4 road (England)|Great West Road]] (a revival of an earlier name for the Bath Road as a by-pass for it around the north of Brentford, Isleworth and Hounslow centres) in the 1920s attracted the building of the factories and headquarters of large companies. The factories were a great local source of employment until a decline in the 1970s, attracting workers from a wide area and leading to a great deal of housing development. In the next two decades offices largely replaced factories on the Great West Road and further expansion in hotel and housing stock has taken place, an example being the Blenheim Centre, an image of which is in the [[Hounslow#Gallery|gallery]] section below.\n\n== Governance ==\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Middlesex]], since 1965 Hounslow has been part of the London Borough of Hounslow, with parts in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]], and [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]].

The east-west roads, the [[A4 road (England)|A4]] 'Great West Road' and the 'Bath Road' that connects Hounslow to [[Central London]] and [[Slough]], and the [[A30 road|A30]] 'Great South West Road' that connects it to [[Staines-upon-Thames]], which meet at Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West. There is also the north-south road, the [[A312 road|A312]] 'The Causeway' and 'The Parkway', which connects Hounslow to [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] in the south and [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] to the north.\n\nAdditionally, A and B roads in Hounslow include the A314 'Hanworth Road' that starts in Hounslow and finishes is [[Hanworth]], [[Feltham]]. The historic A315 'London Road', 'Hounslow High Street', 'Hanworth Road', 'Grove Road' and 'Staines Road';  which starts in Central London down to [[Bedfont]], Feltham. In doing this, it connects Hounslow to towns and districts such as Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Brentford and Isleworth.\n\n===East-west roads===\nThe [[A4 road (England)|A4 Great West Road]] joins with the [[A3006 road (Great Britain)|A3006]] Bath Road (from the A315) before Henlys Roundabout, which is in Hounslow West, from which a [[Boxing the compass|WNW]] route passes [[Heathrow Airport]], terminals 1 to 3 and terminal 5 as the ''Bath Road'' and a WSW route, the [[A30 road (Great Britain)|A30]], passes terminal 4, bypasses [[Staines]] and reaches the [[M25 motorway|M25]]; the remainder is a mostly-minor route to [[Land's End]], Cornwall.\n\nThe [[M4 motorway]] is two miles north; its nearest junction, J3, being northwest along the [[Hounslow#Transport#North-South roads|A312]].\n\nThe A315 is the historic WSW road out of London, on which Hounslow's High Street is placed. To the east, it bisects [[Isleworth]], [[Brentford]] and [[Chiswick]]. To the west it bisects [[Feltham|North Feltham]] and [[East Bedfont|Bedfont]] before joining the A30.\n\n===North-south roads===\nThe north-south [[A312 road (Great Britain)|A312]], ''The Parkway'', to the west of Hounslow leads south to [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] or north to [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] passing Waggoners' Roundabout (WNW of Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West), [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Yeading]] and [[Northolt]].\n\nThree minor roads converge on [[Heston]] from the A315 in parts of Hounslow, the A3063, A3005 and B363. The single road re-divides just north in [[Norwood Green]] into a northwest road to [[Southall]] (the A3005) and into the [[A4127 road (Great Britain)|A4127]] that passes by [[Hanwell]], briefly using the [[A4020 road (Great Britain)|A4020]] west before bypassing [[Dormers Wells]], passing [[Greenford]] to reach [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], the town immediately to the west of [[Wembley]] and [[North Wembley]].\n\nFor longer journeys north, the M4, A4 or A30 then M25 provides the best routes. For longer journeys south, Hanworth Road leads to the [[A316 road (Great Britain)|A316]] that becomes the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]].\n\n===Trains and Underground===\n[[Image:Hounslow Central westbound.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hounslow Central tube station]]]]\nThere are three main London Underground stations in the town; [[Hounslow East tube station|Hounslow East]], [[Hounslow Central tube station|Hounslow Central]] and [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]], with all the stations being on the [[Piccadilly line]].
