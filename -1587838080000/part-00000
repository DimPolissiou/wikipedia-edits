The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of [[Greece]].\n\nChristianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], although the church's apostolicity also rests upon [[Saint Andrew|St. Andrew]] who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, [[Titus (Biblical)|Titus]], Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, [[Luke the Evangelist]] who was martyred in Thebes, [[Lazarus of Bethany]], Bishop of [[Kition]] in Cyprus, and [[John of Patmos|John the Theologian]] who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] recorded in the last book of the [[New Testament]]. In addition, the [[Theotokos]] is regarded as having visited the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]] in 49 AD according to [[Sacred tradition|tradition]].{{#tag:ref|The [[w:Theotokos|Theotokos]] is the Patron of Mount Athos, which is known as: '''The Garden of the Mother of God''', and '''The Holy Mountain of Our Lady'''.

Retrieved: 28 January 2015.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The earliest known prayer to the [[Theotokos]] (Greek, \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \"Bearer of God\") is a prayer found on a fragment of [[papyrus]] dating back to approximately AD 250. In 1917, the [[John Rylands Library]] in Manchester, England, acquired a large panel of Egyptian papyrus. The prayer is located on the fragment recorded as reference number '''Greek Papyrus 470'''. The prayer appears to be from a Coptic Christmas liturgy or vespers written in [[Koine Greek]] although the fragment in question may be a private copy of the prayer. The prayer is still chanted in the Orthodox Church to this day at the end of nearly every [[Vespers#Eastern Orthodox|Vespers]] service during Lent. It is also found in the worship services of the Roman Catholic and Oriental Churches. The early date of this prayer is important for a number of reasons, one of which is that it supports our understanding that the term [[Theotokos]] was not just a theological concept defended at the [[Third Ecumenical Council]] in AD 431, but was already in popular use and well-known several centuries before the [[Nestorian heresy]].  As St. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] stated in AD 379, ''\"If someone does not uphold that the holy Mary is [[Theotokos]], he is separated from divinity\"'' (Letter 101, PG 37, 177C).  Early Christians recognized the [[Intercession of the Theotokos|Theotokos as a powerful intercessor]] for those who are suffering and in need of protection. Christians have been seeking her intercessions from the time of the ancient Church and well over a thousand years up to this very day. The prayer reads:\n:* ''Beneath thy compassion,  We take refuge, O Mother of God:   do not despise our petitions in time of trouble, but rescue us from dangers, only pure one, only blessed one.''<ref name=OODEGR09/>|group=note}}\n\n*c. 251 Martyric death of [[Isidore of Chios]] under the persecutions of Decius.<ref>Great Synaxaristes {{in lang|el}}: ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/3159/sxsaintinfo.aspx \u1f49 \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f38\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039c\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a7\u03af\u1ff3].'' 14 \u039c\u03b1\u0390\u03bf\u03c5. \u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a5\u039d\u0391\u039e\u0391\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0397\u03a3.</ref>\n*262 Great incursion of the [[Goths]] into [[Ionia]], [[Troad|Troas]], [[Lydia]] and [[Phrygia]] in [[Asia Minor]].<ref name=BENGTSON>Hermann Bengtson.

When, for example, during the Avar-Slav siege of September 586, the city was about to fall, John related that a high-ranking civilian dreamt that he saw two angels dressed as imperial guardsmen enter Demetrius' shrine and demand that he quit the city because God had ordered Thessalonica's destruction. But the saint resisted, telling the angels that the city's fate would be his: either God would relent when he heard the Saint's prayers, or he would 'perish' with the city. Shortly thereafter the city was saved and the efficacy of Demetrius' intercessions manifested. Indeed, the man who had the dream was certain that it was Demetrius who had saved the city because the figure he saw in the vision matched exactly 'the form in which he is represented in his ancient images'.\"<ref>Matthew Dal Santo.

In 1917, the [[John Rylands Library]] in Manchester, England, acquired a large panel of Egyptian papyrus. The prayer is located on the fragment recorded as reference number '''Greek Papyrus 470'''. The prayer appears to be from a Coptic Christmas liturgy or vespers written in [[Koine Greek]] although the fragment in question may be a private copy of the prayer. The prayer is still chanted in the Orthodox Church to this day at the end of nearly every [[Vespers#Eastern Orthodox|Vespers]] service during Lent. It is also found in the worship services of the Roman Catholic and Oriental Churches. The early date of this prayer is important for a number of reasons, one of which is that it supports our understanding that the term [[Theotokos]] was not just a theological concept defended at the [[Third Ecumenical Council]] in AD 431, but was already in popular use and well-known several centuries before the [[Nestorian heresy]].  As St. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] stated in AD 379, ''\"If someone does not uphold that the holy Mary is [[Theotokos]], he is separated from divinity\"'' (Letter 101, PG 37, 177C).  Early Christians recognized the [[Intercession of the Theotokos|Theotokos as a powerful intercessor]] for those who are suffering and in need of protection. Christians have been seeking her intercessions from the time of the ancient Church and well over a thousand years up to this very day.

When, for example, during the Avar-Slav siege of September 586, the city was about to fall, John related that a high-ranking civilian dreamt that he saw two angels dressed as imperial guardsmen enter Demetrius' shrine and demand that he quit the city because God had ordered Thessalonica's destruction. But the saint resisted, telling the angels that the city's fate would be his: either God would relent when he heard the Saint's prayers, or he would 'perish' with the city. Shortly thereafter the city was saved and the efficacy of Demetrius' intercessions manifested. Indeed, the man who had the dream was certain that it was Demetrius who had saved the city because the figure he saw in the vision matched exactly 'the form in which he is represented in his ancient images'.\"<ref>Matthew Dal Santo.

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]]. Groups using the \"alt-right\" label have been characterised as [[hate group]]s,<ref name=\"ADL\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy |title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy |website=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right |title=Alt-Right |work=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref> while alt-right material has contributed to the radicalization of white men responsible for various far-right murders and [[Right-wing terrorism|terrorist]] attacks in the U.S. since 2014.<ref name=\"SPLC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017/ |title=ADL Report: White Supremacist Murders More Than Doubled in 2017 |accessdate=January 26, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"DefenseOne\">{{cite news|accessdate=March 2, 2018|title=White Supremacists Killed More Americans Last Year Than Any Other Domestic-Extremist Group|url=http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2018/01/resurgent-threat-white-supremacist-violence/145243/|newspaper=Defense One}}</ref> Opposition to the alt-right has come from many areas of the political spectrum including [[Socialism in the United States|socialists]], [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of dark triad traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the Second World War meant that pride in the U.S. victory over Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of dark triad traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the Second World War meant that pride in the U.S. victory over Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).
