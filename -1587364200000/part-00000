[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] lay in the hands of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], who were appointed by the British government. Ireland sent 105 members of parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish]] [[representative peer]]s elected 28 of their own number to sit for life in the [[House of Lords]]. Between 1832 and 1859, 70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn the 40 years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had, as [[Benjamin Disraeli]] put it in 1844, \"a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, an alien [[Church of Ireland|established Protestant church]], and in addition the weakest executive in the world\".{{sfn|Blake|1967|p=179}} One historian calculated that, between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland, and that \"without exception their findings prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 36}}\n\nLectures printed in 1847 by [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Bishop of New York]], are a contemporary exploration into the antecedent causes, particularly the political climate, in which the Irish famine occurred.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160706011946/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SADLIER/IRISH/Hughues.htm \"A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847\"]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ie/books?id=SH4JQiJ5knAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ireland+cause+of+the+famine#v=onepage&q=ireland%20cause%20of%20the%20famine A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847: Delivered By John Hughes]</ref>\n\n===Landlords and tenants===\nDuring the 18th century, the \"middleman system\" for managing landed property was introduced. Rent collection was left in the hands of the landlords' agents, or middlemen. This assured the landlord of a regular income, and relieved them of direct responsibility, while leaving tenants open to exploitation by the middlemen.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nCatholics, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of [[poverty]] and insecurity despite [[Catholic emancipation]] in 1829, made up 80% of the population. At the top of the \"social pyramid\" was the \"[[Protestant Ascendancy|ascendancy class]]\", the English and [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] families who owned most of the land and held more or less unchecked power over their tenants. Some of their estates were vast; for example, the [[Earl of Lucan]] owned more than {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}. Many of these [[absentee landlord]]s lived in England. The rent revenue\u2014collected from \"impoverished tenants\" who were paid minimal wages to raise crops and livestock for export{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\u2014was mostly sent to England.{{sfn|Litton|1994|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn 1843, the British Government considered that the land question in Ireland was the root cause of disaffection in the country. They established a [[Royal Commission]], chaired by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], to enquire into the laws regarding the occupation of land. [[Daniel O'Connell]] described this commission as \"perfectly one-sided\", being composed of landlords, with no tenant representation.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 20\u201321}}\n\nIn February 1845, Devon reported:\n<blockquote>It would be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they [the Irish labourer and his family] habitually and silently endure&nbsp;... in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water&nbsp;... their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather&nbsp;... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury&nbsp;... and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Commissioners concluded they could not \"forbear expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to sustain\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}} The Commission stated that bad relations between landlord and tenant were principally responsible. There was no hereditary loyalty, feudal tie, or mitigating tradition of paternalism as existed in England (Ireland was a conquered country). The [[John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare|Earl of Clare]] observed of landlords that \"confiscation is their common title\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21}} According to the historian [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], landlords regarded the land as a source of income, from which as much as possible was to be extracted. With the Irish \"brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation\" (in the words of the Earl of Clare), the landlords largely viewed the countryside as a hostile place in which to live. Some landlords visited their property only once or twice in a lifetime, if ever.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}} The rents from Ireland were generally spent elsewhere; an estimated \u00a36,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}}{{efn|About \u00a3{{inflation|UK|6|1842|fmt=c}} million at current prices.}}\n\nThe ability of middlemen was measured by the rent income they could contrive to extract from tenants.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} They were described in evidence before the Commission as \"land sharks\", \"bloodsuckers\", and \"the most oppressive species of tyrant that ever lent assistance to the destruction of a country\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} The middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with fixed rents, which they sublet as they saw fit. They would split a holding into smaller and smaller parcels so as to increase the amount of rent they could obtain. Tenants could be evicted for reasons such as non-payment of rents (which were high), or a landlord's decision to raise sheep instead of [[Cereal|grain crops]]. A [[Cotter (farmer)|cottier]] paid his rent by working for the landlord.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAs any improvement made on a holding by a tenant became the property of the landlord when the lease expired or was terminated, the incentive to make improvements was limited. Most tenants had no security of tenure on the land; as tenants \"at will\", they could be turned out whenever the landlord chose. The only exception to this arrangement was in [[Ulster]] where, under a practice known as [[Custom of Ulster|\"tenant right\"]], a tenant was compensated for any improvement they made to their holding. According to Woodham-Smith, the commission stated that \"the superior prosperity and tranquility of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were due to tenant right\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nLandlords in Ireland often used their powers without compunction, and tenants lived in dread of them. Woodham-Smith writes that, in these circumstances, \"industry and enterprise were extinguished and a peasantry created which was one of the most destitute in Europe\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=24}}\n\n===Tenants, subdivisions, and bankruptcy===\nIn 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4\u20132&nbsp;hectares (1\u20135&nbsp;acres) in size, while 40% were of 2\u20136&nbsp;hectares (5\u201315&nbsp;acres). Holdings were so small that no crop other than potatoes would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine, the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support the tenant families after rent was paid; the families survived only by earnings as seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=15}} Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=15}}\n\nThe 1841 census showed a population of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into [[monoculture]], since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the difference between life and death in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\n===Potato dependency===\n[[File:An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store by Daniel MacDonald.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store'' by Cork artist Daniel MacDonald, ''c.'' 1847]]\nThe potato was introduced to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. The potato was not popular at first;  however, after an unusual promotion campaign that was supported by landowners and members of royalty, who wanted their tenants to plant and eat the crop, it rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|title=The Irish potato famine|accessdate=26 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153837/http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|archivedate=19 March 2012}}</ref> By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food; the main diet was still based on butter, milk, and grain products. By 1800 to 1820, the potato became a staple of the poor, especially in winter.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 19\u201320}} Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the [[Irish Lumper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Evan D.

For the labourer, \"a potato wage\" shaped the expanding agrarian economy.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 20}}\n\n{{quote|The Celtic grazing lands of ...

General crop failures, through disease or frost, were recorded in 1739, 1740, 1770, 1800, and 1807. In 1821 and 1822, the potato crop failed in [[Munster]] and [[Connacht|Connaught]].

Few had been sown, so, despite average yields, hunger continued. 1848 yields were only two-thirds of normal.

The Town Council of [[Belfast]] met and made similar suggestions, but neither body asked for charity, according to [[John Mitchel]], one of the leading Repealers.\n<blockquote>\"They demanded that, if Ireland was indeed an Integral part of the realm, the common exchequer of both islands should be used\u2014not to give alms, but to provide employment on public works of general utility ... if Yorkshire and Lancashire had sustained a like calamity in England, there is no doubt such measures as these would have been taken, promptly and liberally\", Mitchel declared.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}</blockquote>\n\nIn early November 1845, a deputation from the citizens of Dublin, including the [[Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster|Duke of Leinster]], [[Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry|Lord Cloncurry]], Daniel O'Connell and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], went to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, [[William \u00e0 Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury|Lord Heytesbury]], to offer suggestions, such as opening the ports to foreign corn, stopping distillation from grain, prohibiting the export of foodstuffs, and providing employment through public works.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=48\u201349}} Lord Heytesbury urged them not to be alarmed, that they \"were premature\", that scientists were enquiring into all those matters,{{refn|[[Lyon Playfair]] and [[John Lindley]] were sent from England to investigate with the local assistance of [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=44\u201345}}|group = fn}} and that the Inspectors of Constabulary and Stipendiary Magistrates were charged with making constant reports from their districts; and there was no \"immediate pressure on the market\".{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nOn 8 December 1845, Daniel O'Connell, head of the [[Repeal Association]], proposed several remedies to the pending disaster. One of the first things he suggested was the introduction of \"[[Tenant-Right]]\" as practised in Ulster, giving the landlord a fair rent for his land, but giving the tenant compensation for any money he might have laid out on the land in permanent improvements.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}} O'Connell noted actions taken by the Belgian legislature during the same season, as they had been hit by blight, too: shutting their ports against the export of provisions, and opening them to imports. He suggested that, if Ireland had a domestic Parliament, the ports would be thrown open and the abundant crops raised in Ireland would be kept for the people of Ireland, as the Dublin parliament had done during the food shortages of the 1780s. O'Connell maintained that only an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] would provide both food and employment for the people. He said that repeal of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] was a necessity and Ireland's only hope.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}}\n\nJohn Mitchel raised the issue of the \"Potato Disease\" in Ireland as early as 1844 in ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'', noting how powerful an agent hunger had been in certain revolutions.<ref>{{citation|work=The Nation Newspaper|title=Hunger|date=1 November 1844}}</ref> On 14 February 1846, he wrote about \"the wretched way in which the famine was being trifled with\", and asked whether the Government still did not have any conception that there might be soon \"millions of human beings in Ireland having nothing to eat\".{{sfn|O'Sullivan|1945}}\n\n[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|left|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine]]\n\nMitchel later wrote one of the first widely circulated tracts on the famine, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)'', published in 1861. It established the widespread view that British actions during the famine and their treatment of the Irish was a deliberate effort to murder the Irish. It contained a sentence that has since become famous: \"The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|p=312}} Mitchel was charged with [[sedition]] because of his writings, but this charge was dropped.

S. L. Lyons]] characterised the initial response of the British government to the early, less severe phase of the famine as \"prompt and relatively successful\".{{sfn|Lyons|1973|p=30}} Confronted by widespread crop failure in November 1845, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, purchased \u00a3100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=54\u201356}} with [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] initially acting as his agents. The government hoped that they would not \"stifle private enterprise\" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to poor weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} The initial shipments were of unground dried kernels, but the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=64\u201365}} In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed, it had to be \"very much\" cooked again, or eating it could result in severe bowel complaints.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} Due to its yellow colour, and initial unpopularity, it became known as \"Peel's brimstone\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=73}}\n\nIn October 1845, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]]\u2014[[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread high\u2014but the issue split his party and he had insufficient support from his own colleagues to push the measure through. He resigned the premiership in December, but the opposition was unable to form a government and he was re-appointed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=51\u201352}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland,{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=78}} but the famine situation worsened during 1846, and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221\u2013241}} On 25 June, the [[second reading]] of the government's [[Protection of Person and Property Act 1881#Coercion legislation in Ireland|Irish Coercion Bill]] was defeated by 73 votes in the House of Commons by a combination of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], Irish Repealers, and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] Conservatives. Peel was forced to resign as prime minister on 29 June, and the Whig leader, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], became prime minister.{{sfn|Doheny|1951|p=98}}\n\n===Whig government===\nThe measures undertaken by Peel's successor, Russell, proved inadequate as the crisis deepened. The new Whig administration, influenced by the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]],{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 410\u2013411}} believed that the market would provide the food needed. They refused to interfere with the movement of food to England, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food.{{sfn|Ross|2002|pp = 224, 311}} Russell's ministry introduced a new programme of public works that by the end of December 1846 employed some half million but proved impossible to administer.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Doolough.jpg|thumb|left|A memorial to the victims of the [[Doolough Tragedy]] (30 March 1849). To continue receiving relief, hundreds were instructed to travel many miles in bad weather. A large number died on the journey.]]\n\n[[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], who was in charge of the administration of government relief, limited the Government's food aid programme because of a firm belief in laissez-faire.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=87, 106\u2013108}}\n\nIn January 1847, the government abandoned this policy, realising that it had failed, and turned to a mixture of \"indoor\" and \"outdoor\" direct relief; the former administered in [[workhouse]]s through the [[Irish Poor Laws]], the latter through [[soup kitchen]]s. The costs of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, some of whom in turn attempted to reduce their liability by evicting their tenants.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn June 1847 the Poor Law Amendment Act was passed which embodied the principle, popular in Britain, that Irish property must support Irish poverty. The landed proprietors in Ireland were held in Britain to have created the conditions that led to the famine.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=296\u2013297}} However, it was asserted that the British parliament since the Act of Union of 1800 was partly to blame.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}} This point was raised in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' on 13 February 1847: \"There was no law it would not pass at their request, and no abuse it would not defend for them.\" On 24 March, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Britain had permitted in Ireland \"a mass of poverty, disaffection, and degradation without a parallel in the world. It allowed proprietors to suck the very life-blood of that wretched race\".{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\" of the Poor Law, named after [[William Henry Gregory|William H. Gregory]], M.P.{{refn|William H. Gregory became the husband of [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]]. He was heir to a substantial Galway estate in 1847, which he dissipated by gambling debts on the turf in the late 1840s and early 1850s.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=159}}|group = fn}}, prohibited anyone who held at least {{frac|1|4}} of an acre (0.1 ha) from receiving relief.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}} In practice, this meant that, if a farmer, having sold all his produce to pay rent and taxes, should be reduced, as many thousands of them were, to applying for public outdoor relief, he would not get it until he had first delivered up all his land to the landlord. Of this Law, Mitchel wrote that \"it is the [[able-bodied]] idler only who is to be fed\u2014if he attempted to till but one [[Rood (unit)|rood]] of ground, he dies\". This simple method of ejectment was called \"passing paupers through the workhouse\"\u2014a man went in, a pauper came out.{{sfn|Mitchel|1996|p = 16}} These factors combined to drive thousands of people off the land: 90,000 in 1849, and 104,000 in 1850.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn 1849 the [[Encumbered Estates' Court|Encumbered Estates Act]] allowed landlord estates to be auctioned off upon the petition of creditors. Estates with debts were then auctioned off at low prices. Wealthy British speculators purchased the lands and \"took a harsh view\" of the tenant farmers who continued renting. The rents were raised and tenants evicted to create large cattle grazing pastures. Between 1849 and 1854, some 50,000 families were evicted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170107041845/http://www.historicalballinrobe.com/page_id__166.aspx  Ballinrobe Local History: The Encumbered Estates Acts, 1848 and 1849]</ref><ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/240915  Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives (review) David W.

(''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).]]\n\nRecords show that Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782\u201383, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=11}} No such export ban happened in the 1840s.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=354}}\n\nThroughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food. In the magazine ''[[History Ireland]]'' (1997, issue 5, pp.&nbsp;32\u201336), [[Christine Kinealy]], a Great Hunger scholar, lecturer, and [[Drew University]] professor, relates her findings: Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases. She also writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine. This food was shipped from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland: Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport. A wide variety of commodities left Ireland during 1847, including peas, beans, onions, rabbits, salmon, oysters, herring, lard, honey, tongues, animal skins, rags, shoes, soap, glue, and seed.\n\nOne of the most shocking export figures concern butter. Butter was shipped in firkins, each one holding {{convert|1|firkin|impgal l|0|disp=out|abbr=off}}. In the first nine months of 1847, {{convert|56557|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were exported from Ireland to Bristol, and {{convert|34852|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were shipped to Liverpool, which correlates with {{convert|822681|impgal|l|abbr=off}} of butter exported to England from Ireland during nine months of the worst year of the Famine.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=10}} The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=165}}\n\nWriting in 1849, English poet and social reformer [[Ebenezer Jones]] wrote that \"In the year A.D. 1846, there were exported from Ireland, 3,266,193 quarters of wheat, barley and oats, besides flour, beans, peas, and rye; 186,483 cattle, 6,363 calves, 259,257 sheep, 180,827 swine; (food, that is, in the shape of meat and bread, for about one half of the Irish population), and yet this very year of A.D. 1846 was pre-eminently, owing to a land monopoly, the famine year for the Irish people.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Ebenezer |title=The Land Monopoly: The Suffering and Demoralization Caused by It, and the Justice & Expediency of Its Abolition |date=1849 |publisher=Chas.

Only by selling food, some of which would inevitably be exported, could a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|\"virtuous circle\"]] be created whereby the rents and rates would be paid, and the workhouses funded.

Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over \u00a34 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, there had been some clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=95}} According to [[James S. Donnelly, Jr.]], it is impossible to be sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=155}}\n\nDonnelly considered this to be an underestimate, and if the figures were to include the number pressured into \"voluntary\" surrenders during the whole period (1846\u20131854), the figure would almost certainly exceed half a million persons.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 156}} While Helen Litton says there were also thousands of \"voluntary\" surrenders, she notes also that there was \"precious little voluntary about them\". In some cases, tenants were persuaded to accept a small sum of money to leave their homes, \"cheated into believing the workhouse would take them in\".{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 95}}\n\nWest Clare was one of the worst areas for evictions, where landlords turned thousands of families out and demolished their derisory cabins. Captain Kennedy in April 1848 estimated that 1,000 houses, with an average of six people to each, had been levelled since November.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=96}} The Mahon family of Strokestown House evicted 3,000 people in 1847, and were still able to dine on lobster soup.{{sfn|Gibney|2008|p=55}}\n\nAfter Clare, the worst area for evictions was County Mayo, accounting for 10% of all evictions between 1849 and 1854. [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan]], who owned over {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}, was among the worst evicting landlords. He was quoted as saying that \"he would not breed paupers to pay priests\". Having turned out in the parish of Ballinrobe over 2,000 tenants alone, he then used the cleared land as grazing farms.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 98}} In 1848, the Marquis of Sligo owed \u00a31,650 to Westport Union; he was also an evicting landlord, though he claimed to be selective, saying that he was only getting rid of the idle and dishonest. Altogether, he cleared about 25% of his tenants.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nIn 1847, [[Bishop of Meath]], [[Thomas Nulty]], described his personal recollection of the evictions in a pastoral letter to his clergy:\n\n{{quote|Seven hundred human beings were driven from their homes in one day and set adrift on the world, to gratify the caprice of one who, before God and man, probably deserved less consideration than the last and least of them ...

The landed proprietors in a circle all around\u2014and for many miles in every direction\u2014warned their tenantry, with threats of their direct vengeance, against the humanity of extending to any of them the hospitality of a single night's shelter ... and in little more than three years, nearly a fourth of them lay quietly in their graves.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\">{{cite journal|last=Falc'her-Poyroux|first=Erick|title=The Great Irish Famine in Songs|journal=Revue Fran\u00e7aise de Civilisation Britannique [Online]|volume=XIX|issue=2|pages=157\u2013172|date=2014|issn=2429-4373|doi=10.4000/rfcb.277|doi-access=free}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Litton, evictions might have taken place earlier but for fear of the secret societies. However, they were now greatly weakened by the Famine. Revenge still occasionally took place, with seven landlords being shot, six fatally, during the autumn and winter of 1847. Ten other occupiers of land, though without tenants, were also murdered, she says.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=99}}\n\nOne such landlord reprisal occurred in West [[Roscommon]]. The \"notorious\" landlord Maj Denis Mahon enforced thousands of his tenants into eviction before the end of 1847, with an estimated 60 percent decline in population in some [[parish]]es. He was shot dead in that year.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/pioneering-study-charts-population-fall-since-famine-1.588108 Pioneering study charts population fall since Famine]</ref> In East Roscommon, \"where conditions were more benign\", the estimated decline in population was under 10 percent.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\n[[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], alarmed at the number of landlords being shot and that this might mean rebellion, asked for special powers. Lord John Russell was not sympathetic to this appeal. Lord Clarendon believed that the landlords themselves were mostly responsible for the tragedy in the first place, saying that \"It is quite true that landlords in England would not like to be shot like hares and partridges ... but neither does any landlord in England turn out fifty persons at once and burn their houses over their heads, giving them no provision for the future.\" The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847|Crime and Outrage Act]] was passed in December 1847 as a compromise, and additional troops were sent to Ireland.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\", described by Donnelly as a \"vicious amendment to the Irish poor law\", had been a successful Tory amendment to the Whig poor-relief bill which became law in early June 1847, where its potential as an estate-clearing device was widely recognised in parliament, although not in advance.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=159}} At first, the poor law commissioners and inspectors viewed the clause as a valuable instrument for a more cost-effective administration of public relief, but the drawbacks soon became apparent, even from an administrative perspective. They would soon view them as little more than murderous from a humanitarian perspective. According to Donnelly, it became obvious that the quarter-acre clause was \"indirectly a death-dealing instrument\".{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p=110}}\n\n==Emigration==\n{{main|Irish diaspora|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}\n[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''The Emigrants' Farewell'', engraving by [[Henry Doyle]] (1827\u20131893), from [[Mary Frances Cusack]]'s ''Illustrated History of Ireland'', 1868]]\n\nWhile the famine was responsible for a significant increase in emigration from Ireland, of anywhere from 45% to nearly 85% depending on the year and the county, it was not the sole cause. The beginning of mass emigration from Ireland can be traced to the mid-18th century, when some 250,000 people left Ireland over a period of 50 years to settle in the [[New World]]. Irish economist Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million people emigrated during the 30 years between 1815 (when [[Napoleon]] was defeated in [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]) and 1845 (when the Great Famine began).{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1975|p = }} However, during the worst of the famine, emigration reached somewhere around 250,000 in one year alone, with western Ireland seeing the most emigrants.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2007}}\n\nFamilies did not migrate ''en masse'', but younger members of families did, so much so that emigration almost became a [[rite of passage]], as evidenced by the data that show that, unlike similar emigrations throughout world history, women emigrated just as often, just as early, and in the same numbers as men. The emigrants would send remittances (reaching a total of \u00a31,404,000 by 1851) back to family in Ireland, which, in turn, allowed another member of their family to leave.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 371}}\n\nEmigration during the famine years of 1845\u20131850 was primarily to England, Scotland, South Wales, North America, and Australia; one city that experienced a particularly strong influx of Irish immigrants was [[Liverpool]], with at least one quarter of the city's population being Irish-born by 1851.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 268}} Many of those fleeing to the Americas used the well-established [[McCorkell Line]].{{sfn|McCorkell|2010|p = }}\n\n[[File:Population of Ireland and Europe 1750 to 2005.svg|thumb|left|A graph of the populations of Ireland [left axis] and Europe [right axis]{{dubious|date=October 2018}} indexed against date.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Excluding the [[Demography of Scotland|population of Scotland]] and [[Demography of Wales|Wales]] between the 1841 and 1851 censuses the [[Demography of England|population of England]], grew at a similar rate as the decades previous, from 14.8 to 16.7 million.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10061325/cube/TOT_POP Vision of Britain a population through time England], Retrieved 9 August 2013</ref>]]\n\nOf the more than 100,000 Irish that sailed to [[Canada]] in 1847, an estimated one out of five died from disease and malnutrition, including over 5,000 at [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]], an island in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] used to quarantine ships near [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=238}} Overcrowded, poorly maintained, and badly provisioned vessels known as [[coffin ship]]s sailed from small, unregulated harbours in the West of Ireland in contravention of British safety requirements, and mortality rates were high.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=216\u2013217}} The 1851 census reported that more than half the inhabitants of [[Toronto]] were Irish, and, in 1847 alone, 38,000 Irish flooded a city with fewer than 20,000 citizens. Other Canadian cities such as Quebec City, [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] also received large numbers.

However, fearing nationalist insurgencies, the British government placed harsh restrictions on Irish immigration to Canada after 1847, resulting in larger influxes to the United States.\n\nIn America, most Irish became city-dwellers; with little money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships they came on landed in.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=267}} By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in [[Boston]], New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In addition, Irish populations became prevalent in some American mining communities.\n\nThe famine marked the beginning of the depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century. Population had increased by 13\u201314% in the first three decades of the 19th century; between 1831 and 1841, population grew by 5%. Application of [[Thomas Malthus]]'s idea of population expanding geometrically while resources increase arithmetically was popular during the famines of 1817 and 1822. By the 1830s, they were seen as overly simplistic, and Ireland's problems were seen \"less as an excess of population than as a lack of [[capital investment]]\".{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }} The population of Ireland was increasing no faster than that of England, which suffered no equivalent catastrophe.

They recorded 21,770 total deaths from starvation in the previous decade, and 400,720 deaths from disease. Listed diseases were fever, [[diphtheria]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]], and [[influenza]], with the first two being the main killers (222,021 and 93,232). The commissioners acknowledged that their figures were incomplete and that the true number of deaths was probably higher:\n\n<blockquote>The greater the amount of destitution of mortality&nbsp;... the less will be the amount of recorded deaths derived through any household form;\u2014for not only were whole families swept away by disease&nbsp;... but whole villages were effaced from off the land.</blockquote>\n\nLater historians agree that the 1851 death tables \"were flawed and probably under-estimated the level of mortality\".{{sfn|Killen|1995|pp = 250\u2013252}}{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=167}} The combination of institutional and figures provided by individuals gives \"an incomplete and biased count\" of fatalities during the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2006|p=3}}\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, referencing the work of W.

The diseases that badly affected the population fell into two categories:{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}} famine-induced diseases and diseases of [[Illnesses related to poor nutrition|nutritional deficiency]]. Of the nutritional deficiency diseases, the most commonly experienced were starvation and [[marasmus]], as well as a condition at the time called dropsy. Dropsy ([[oedema]]) was a popular name given for the symptoms of several diseases, one of which, [[kwashiorkor]], is associated with starvation.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}}\n\nHowever, the greatest mortality was not from nutritional deficiency diseases, but from famine-induced ailments.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}}{{sfn|Livi-Bacci|1991|p=38}} The malnourished are very vulnerable to [[infection]]s; therefore, these were more severe when they occurred. [[Measles]], [[diphteria]], [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], [[tuberculosis]], most [[respiratory infection]]s, [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], many [[intestinal parasite]]s, and cholera were all strongly conditioned by nutritional status. Potentially lethal diseases, such as smallpox and influenza, were so virulent that their spread was independent of nutrition. The best example of this phenomenon was fever, which exacted the greatest death toll. In the popular mind, as well as medical opinion, fever and famine were closely related.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=196}} Social dislocation\u2014the congregation of the hungry at soup kitchens, food depots, and overcrowded work houses\u2014created conditions that were ideal for spreading infectious diseases such as [[typhus]], [[typhoid]], and [[relapsing fever]].{{sfn|Livi-Bacci|1991|p=38}} {{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}}\n\nDiarrhoeal diseases were the result of poor hygiene, bad sanitation, and dietary changes. The concluding attack on a population incapacitated by famine was delivered by Asiatic cholera, which had visited Ireland briefly in the 1830s. In the following decade, it spread uncontrollably across Asia, through Europe, and into Britain, finally reaching Ireland in 1849.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}} Some scholars estimate that the population of Ireland was reduced by 20\u201325%.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Legacy of the Great Irish Famine}}\n\nIreland's mean age of marriage in 1830 was 23.8 for women and 27.5 for men, where they had once been 21 for women and 25 for men, and those who never married numbered about 10% of the population;<ref>Lee, Joseph J. 2008.

The policy, however, would soon be [[Plan of Campaign|suppressed]].

Also, large areas of the country became uninhabited and the folk song collectors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries did not collect the songs they heard in the Irish language, as the language of the peasantry was often regarded as dead, or \"not delicate enough for educated ears\". Of the songs that have survived probably the best known is [[Skibbereen (song)|Skibbereen]]. Emigration has been an important sources of inspiration for songs of the Irish during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\"/> Since the 1970s a number of songs about the famine have been written and recorded, such as \"[[The Fields of Athenry]]\" by [[Pete St. John]], \"[[Famine]]\" by [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and \"Thousands are Sailing\" by [[the Pogues]].\n\n==Analysis of the government's role==\n===Contemporary===\nContemporary opinion was sharply critical of the Russell government's response to and management of the crisis. From the start, there were accusations that the government failed to grasp the magnitude of the disaster. Sir James Graham, who had served as [[Home Secretary]] in Sir Robert Peel's late government, wrote to Peel that, in his opinion, \"the real extent and magnitude of the Irish difficulty are underestimated by the Government, and cannot be met by measures within the strict rule of economical science\".{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=80}}\n\nThis criticism was not confined to outside critics. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: \"I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.\"{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=381}} Also in 1849, the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6p in the pound levy on all rateable properties in Ireland.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|pp = 254\u2013260}} Twisleton testified that \"comparatively trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of permitting its miserable fellow subjects to die of starvation\". According to [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]] in his book ''The Irish Famine'', the government spent \u00a37 million for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, \"representing less than half of one percent of the British [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] over five years. Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the \u00a320 million compensation given to [[Caribbean|West Indian]] slave-owners in the 1830s.\"{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }}\n\nOther critics maintained that, even after the government recognised the scope of the crisis, it failed to take sufficient steps to address it. John Mitchel, one of the leaders of the Young Ireland Movement, wrote in 1860:\n\n<blockquote>I have called it an artificial famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a \"dispensation of Providence\"; and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nStill other critics saw reflected in the government's response its attitude to the so-called \"[[Irish Question]]\". [[Nassau Senior]], an economics professor at [[Oxford University]], wrote that the Famine \"would not kill more than one million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do any good\".{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }} In 1848, Denis Shine Lawlor suggested that Russell was a student of the Elizabethan poet [[Edmund Spenser]], who had calculated \"how far English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out by Irish starvation\".{{sfn|Donnelly|1995|p = }} Charles Trevelyan, the civil servant with most direct responsibility for the government's handling of the famine, described it in 1848 as \"a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence\", which laid bare \"the deep and inveterate root of social evil\"; he affirmed that the Famine was \"the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected. God grant that the generation to which this opportunity has been offered may rightly perform its part...\"{{sfn|Trevelyan|1848|p = }}\n\n===Historical===\nChristine Kinealy has written that \"the major tragedy of the Irish Famine of 1845\u201352 marked a watershed in modern Irish history. Its occurrence, however, was neither inevitable nor unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p = xv}} The underlying factors which combined to cause the famine were aggravated by an inadequate government response. As Kinealy notes:\n\n{{quote|[T]he government had to do something to help alleviate the suffering, the particular nature of the actual response, especially following 1846, suggests a more covert agenda and motivation. As the Famine progressed, it became apparent that the government was using its information not merely to help it formulate its relief policies, but also as an opportunity to facilitate various long-desired changes within Ireland. These included population control and the consolidation of property through various means, including emigration ... Despite the overwhelming evidence of prolonged distress caused by successive years of potato blight, the underlying philosophy of the relief efforts was that they should be kept to a minimalist level; in fact they actually decreased as the Famine progressed.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=353}}}}\n\nSeveral writers single out the decision of the government to permit the continued export of food from Ireland as suggestive of the policy-makers' attitudes. [[Leon Uris]] suggested that \"there was ample food within Ireland\", while all the Irish-bred cattle were being shipped off to England.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=16}} The following exchange appeared in Act IV of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Man and Superman]]'':\n\n{{poemquote|MALONE. He will get over it all right enough. Men thrive better on disappointments in love than on disappointments in money. I daresay you think that sordid; but I know what I'm talking about.

When a country is full of food, and exporting it, there can be no famine. My father was starved dead; and I was starved out to America in my mother's arms.

I want no middle class properties and no middle class women for Hector. That's straightforward isn't it, like yourself?{{sfn|Shaw|1903|p = }}}}\n\nSome also pointed to the structure of the British Empire as a contributing factor. [[James Anthony Froude]] wrote that \"England governed Ireland for what she deemed her own interest, making her calculations on the gross balance of her trade ledgers, and leaving moral obligations aside, as if right and wrong had been blotted out of the statute book of the Universe.\"{{sfn|MacManus|1921|p=492}} Dennis Clark, an [[Irish American|Irish-American]] historian and critic of empire, claimed the famine was \"the culmination of generations of neglect, misrule and repression. It was an epic of English colonial cruelty and inadequacy. For the landless cabin dwellers it meant emigration or extinction...\"{{sfn|Clark|1982|p = }}\n\n===Genocide question{{anchor|Genocide}}===\n{{see also|Genocides in history#British Empire}}\n[[File:An gorta Mor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''Ireland's Holocaust'' mural on the Ballymurphy Road, [[Belfast]]. \"An Gorta M\u00f3r, Britain's genocide by starvation, Ireland's holocaust 1845\u20131849, over 1,500,000 deaths\".]]\nThe famine remains a controversial event in Irish history. Debate and discussion on the British government's response to the failure of the potato crop in Ireland, the exportation of food crops and livestock, the subsequent large-scale starvation, and whether or not this constituted [[genocide]], remains a historically and politically charged issue.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]] included the famine in the \"Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum\" for its [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] schools.{{refn|Approved by the New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education on 10 September 1996, for inclusion in the Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum at the secondary level.

Boyle]], who had not been previously known for studying Irish history.{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} They concluded that the British government deliberately pursued a race- and ethnicity-based policy aimed at destroying the Irish people and that the policy of mass starvation amounted to genocide per the [[Genocide Convention|Hague Convention of 1948]].{{refn|\"Clearly, during the years 1845 to 1850, the British government pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland with intent to destroy in substantial part the national, ethnic and racial group commonly known as the Irish People ... Therefore, during the years 1845 to 1850 the British government knowingly pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland that constituted acts of genocide against the Irish people within the meaning of Article II (c) of the 1948 [Hague] [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]].\"{{sfn|Ritschel|1996}}|group=fn}}\n\nJournalist Peter Duffy writes that \"The government's crime, which deserves to blacken its name forever\", was rooted \"in the effort to regenerate Ireland\" through \"landlord-engineered replacement of tillage plots with grazing lands\" that \"took precedence over the obligation to provide food ... for its starving citizens. It is little wonder that the policy looked to many people like genocide.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|pp=297\u2013298}} James S. Donnelly, Jr., a historian at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], wrote in his book, ''Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland'':\n\n<blockquote>I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed in a major way to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority ... And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during and as a result of the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da disagreed that the famine was genocide. He argues that \"genocide includes murderous intent, and it must be said that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish\", and also that most people in [[Whitehall]] \"hoped for better times for Ireland\". Additionally, he states that the claim of genocide overlooks \"the enormous challenge facing relief agencies, both central and local, public and private\".{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} Edward Lengel claims that views of the Irish as racially inferior, and for this reason significantly responsible for their circumstances, gained purchase in Great Britain during and immediately after the famine, especially through influential publications such as ''The Medical Times'' and ''The Times''.{{sfn|Lengel|2002|pp=12, 48, 104}}\n\nThe Great Famine in Ireland has been compared to the ''[[Holodomor]]'' (\"hunger plague\") that took place in the [[Ukraine]] under [[Stalin]] in 1932,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|title=Holodomor and Gorta M\u00f3r|publisher=Anthem Press|accessdate=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120152317/http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|archive-date=20 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> which has been the subject of [[Holodomor genocide question|similar controversy and debate]].\n\nAccording to [[Liam Kennedy (historian)|Liam Kennedy]], \"virtually all historians of Ireland\" reject the genocide allegations.

[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] lay in the hands of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], who were appointed by the British government. Ireland sent 105 members of parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish]] [[representative peer]]s elected 28 of their own number to sit for life in the [[House of Lords]]. Between 1832 and 1859, 70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn the 40 years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had, as [[Benjamin Disraeli]] put it in 1844, \"a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, an alien [[Church of Ireland|established Protestant church]], and in addition the weakest executive in the world\".{{sfn|Blake|1967|p=179}} One historian calculated that, between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland, and that \"without exception their findings prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 36}}\n\nLectures printed in 1847 by [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Bishop of New York]], are a contemporary exploration into the antecedent causes, particularly the political climate, in which the Irish famine occurred.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160706011946/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SADLIER/IRISH/Hughues.htm \"A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847\"]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ie/books?id=SH4JQiJ5knAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ireland+cause+of+the+famine#v=onepage&q=ireland%20cause%20of%20the%20famine A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847: Delivered By John Hughes]</ref>\n\n===Landlords and tenants===\nDuring the 18th century, the \"middleman system\" for managing landed property was introduced. Rent collection was left in the hands of the landlords' agents, or middlemen. This assured the landlord of a regular income, and relieved them of direct responsibility, while leaving tenants open to exploitation by the middlemen.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nCatholics, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of [[poverty]] and insecurity despite [[Catholic emancipation]] in 1829, made up 80% of the population. At the top of the \"social pyramid\" was the \"[[Protestant Ascendancy|ascendancy class]]\", the English and [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] families who owned most of the land and held more or less unchecked power over their tenants. Some of their estates were vast; for example, the [[Earl of Lucan]] owned more than {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}. Many of these [[absentee landlord]]s lived in England. The rent revenue\u2014collected from \"impoverished tenants\" who were paid minimal wages to raise crops and livestock for export{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\u2014was mostly sent to England.{{sfn|Litton|1994|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn 1843, the British Government considered that the land question in Ireland was the root cause of disaffection in the country. They established a [[Royal Commission]], chaired by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], to enquire into the laws regarding the occupation of land. [[Daniel O'Connell]] described this commission as \"perfectly one-sided\", being composed of landlords, with no tenant representation.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 20\u201321}}\n\nIn February 1845, Devon reported:\n<blockquote>It would be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they [the Irish labourer and his family] habitually and silently endure&nbsp;... in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water&nbsp;... their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather&nbsp;... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury&nbsp;... and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Commissioners concluded they could not \"forbear expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to sustain\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}} The Commission stated that bad relations between landlord and tenant were principally responsible. There was no hereditary loyalty, feudal tie, or mitigating tradition of paternalism as existed in England (Ireland was a conquered country). The [[John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare|Earl of Clare]] observed of landlords that \"confiscation is their common title\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21}} According to the historian [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], landlords regarded the land as a source of income, from which as much as possible was to be extracted. With the Irish \"brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation\" (in the words of the Earl of Clare), the landlords largely viewed the countryside as a hostile place in which to live. Some landlords visited their property only once or twice in a lifetime, if ever.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}} The rents from Ireland were generally spent elsewhere; an estimated \u00a36,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}}{{efn|About \u00a3{{inflation|UK|6|1842|fmt=c}} million at current prices.}}\n\nThe ability of middlemen was measured by the rent income they could contrive to extract from tenants.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} They were described in evidence before the Commission as \"land sharks\", \"bloodsuckers\", and \"the most oppressive species of tyrant that ever lent assistance to the destruction of a country\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} The middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with fixed rents, which they sublet as they saw fit. They would split a holding into smaller and smaller parcels so as to increase the amount of rent they could obtain. Tenants could be evicted for reasons such as non-payment of rents (which were high), or a landlord's decision to raise sheep instead of [[Cereal|grain crops]]. A [[Cotter (farmer)|cottier]] paid his rent by working for the landlord.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAs any improvement made on a holding by a tenant became the property of the landlord when the lease expired or was terminated, the incentive to make improvements was limited. Most tenants had no security of tenure on the land; as tenants \"at will\", they could be turned out whenever the landlord chose. The only exception to this arrangement was in [[Ulster]] where, under a practice known as [[Custom of Ulster|\"tenant right\"]], a tenant was compensated for any improvement they made to their holding. According to Woodham-Smith, the commission stated that \"the superior prosperity and tranquility of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were due to tenant right\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nLandlords in Ireland often used their powers without compunction, and tenants lived in dread of them. Woodham-Smith writes that, in these circumstances, \"industry and enterprise were extinguished and a peasantry created which was one of the most destitute in Europe\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=24}}\n\n===Tenants, subdivisions, and bankruptcy===\nIn 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4\u20132&nbsp;hectares (1\u20135&nbsp;acres) in size, while 40% were of 2\u20136&nbsp;hectares (5\u201315&nbsp;acres). Holdings were so small that no crop other than potatoes would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine, the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support the tenant families after rent was paid; the families survived only by earnings as seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=15}} Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=15}}\n\nThe 1841 census showed a population of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into [[monoculture]], since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the difference between life and death in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\n===Potato dependency===\n[[File:An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store by Daniel MacDonald.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store'' by Cork artist Daniel MacDonald, ''c.'' 1847]]\nThe potato was introduced to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. The potato was not popular at first;  however, after an unusual promotion campaign that was supported by landowners and members of royalty, who wanted their tenants to plant and eat the crop, it rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|title=The Irish potato famine|accessdate=26 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153837/http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|archivedate=19 March 2012}}</ref> By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food; the main diet was still based on butter, milk, and grain products. By 1800 to 1820, the potato became a staple of the poor, especially in winter.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 19\u201320}} Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the [[Irish Lumper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Evan D.

For the labourer, \"a potato wage\" shaped the expanding agrarian economy.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 20}}\n\n{{quote|The Celtic grazing lands of ...

In 1830 and 1831, [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Galway|Galway]] suffered likewise. In 1832, 1833, 1834, and 1836, dry rot and curl caused serious losses, and in 1835 the potato failed in Ulster. Widespread failures throughout Ireland occurred in 1836, 1837, 1839, 1841, and 1844.

The Town Council of [[Belfast]] met and made similar suggestions, but neither body asked for charity, according to [[John Mitchel]], one of the leading Repealers.\n<blockquote>\"They demanded that, if Ireland was indeed an Integral part of the realm, the common exchequer of both islands should be used\u2014not to give alms, but to provide employment on public works of general utility ... if Yorkshire and Lancashire had sustained a like calamity in England, there is no doubt such measures as these would have been taken, promptly and liberally\", Mitchel declared.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}</blockquote>\n\nIn early November 1845, a deputation from the citizens of Dublin, including the [[Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster|Duke of Leinster]], [[Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry|Lord Cloncurry]], Daniel O'Connell and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], went to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, [[William \u00e0 Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury|Lord Heytesbury]], to offer suggestions, such as opening the ports to foreign corn, stopping distillation from grain, prohibiting the export of foodstuffs, and providing employment through public works.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=48\u201349}} Lord Heytesbury urged them not to be alarmed, that they \"were premature\", that scientists were enquiring into all those matters,{{refn|[[Lyon Playfair]] and [[John Lindley]] were sent from England to investigate with the local assistance of [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=44\u201345}}|group = fn}} and that the Inspectors of Constabulary and Stipendiary Magistrates were charged with making constant reports from their districts; and there was no \"immediate pressure on the market\".{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nOn 8 December 1845, Daniel O'Connell, head of the [[Repeal Association]], proposed several remedies to the pending disaster. One of the first things he suggested was the introduction of \"[[Tenant-Right]]\" as practised in Ulster, giving the landlord a fair rent for his land, but giving the tenant compensation for any money he might have laid out on the land in permanent improvements.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}} O'Connell noted actions taken by the Belgian legislature during the same season, as they had been hit by blight, too: shutting their ports against the export of provisions, and opening them to imports. He suggested that, if Ireland had a domestic Parliament, the ports would be thrown open and the abundant crops raised in Ireland would be kept for the people of Ireland, as the Dublin parliament had done during the food shortages of the 1780s. O'Connell maintained that only an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] would provide both food and employment for the people. He said that repeal of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] was a necessity and Ireland's only hope.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}}\n\nJohn Mitchel raised the issue of the \"Potato Disease\" in Ireland as early as 1844 in ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'', noting how powerful an agent hunger had been in certain revolutions.<ref>{{citation|work=The Nation Newspaper|title=Hunger|date=1 November 1844}}</ref> On 14 February 1846, he wrote about \"the wretched way in which the famine was being trifled with\", and asked whether the Government still did not have any conception that there might be soon \"millions of human beings in Ireland having nothing to eat\".{{sfn|O'Sullivan|1945}}\n\n[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|left|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine]]\n\nMitchel later wrote one of the first widely circulated tracts on the famine, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)'', published in 1861. It established the widespread view that British actions during the famine and their treatment of the Irish was a deliberate effort to murder the Irish. It contained a sentence that has since become famous: \"The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|p=312}} Mitchel was charged with [[sedition]] because of his writings, but this charge was dropped.

S. L. Lyons]] characterised the initial response of the British government to the early, less severe phase of the famine as \"prompt and relatively successful\".{{sfn|Lyons|1973|p=30}} Confronted by widespread crop failure in November 1845, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, purchased \u00a3100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=54\u201356}} with [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] initially acting as his agents. The government hoped that they would not \"stifle private enterprise\" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to poor weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} The initial shipments were of unground dried kernels, but the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=64\u201365}} In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed, it had to be \"very much\" cooked again, or eating it could result in severe bowel complaints.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} Due to its yellow colour, and initial unpopularity, it became known as \"Peel's brimstone\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=73}}\n\nIn October 1845, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]]\u2014[[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread high\u2014but the issue split his party and he had insufficient support from his own colleagues to push the measure through. He resigned the premiership in December, but the opposition was unable to form a government and he was re-appointed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=51\u201352}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland,{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=78}} but the famine situation worsened during 1846, and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221\u2013241}} On 25 June, the [[second reading]] of the government's [[Protection of Person and Property Act 1881#Coercion legislation in Ireland|Irish Coercion Bill]] was defeated by 73 votes in the House of Commons by a combination of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], Irish Repealers, and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] Conservatives. Peel was forced to resign as prime minister on 29 June, and the Whig leader, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], became prime minister.{{sfn|Doheny|1951|p=98}}\n\n===Whig government===\nThe measures undertaken by Peel's successor, Russell, proved inadequate as the crisis deepened. The new Whig administration, influenced by the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]],{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 410\u2013411}} believed that the market would provide the food needed. They refused to interfere with the movement of food to England, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food.{{sfn|Ross|2002|pp = 224, 311}} Russell's ministry introduced a new programme of public works that by the end of December 1846 employed some half million but proved impossible to administer.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Doolough.jpg|thumb|left|A memorial to the victims of the [[Doolough Tragedy]] (30 March 1849).

The costs of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, some of whom in turn attempted to reduce their liability by evicting their tenants.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn June 1847 the Poor Law Amendment Act was passed which embodied the principle, popular in Britain, that Irish property must support Irish poverty. The landed proprietors in Ireland were held in Britain to have created the conditions that led to the famine.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=296\u2013297}} However, it was asserted that the British parliament since the Act of Union of 1800 was partly to blame.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}} This point was raised in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' on 13 February 1847: \"There was no law it would not pass at their request, and no abuse it would not defend for them.\" On 24 March, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Britain had permitted in Ireland \"a mass of poverty, disaffection, and degradation without a parallel in the world. It allowed proprietors to suck the very life-blood of that wretched race\".{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\" of the Poor Law, named after [[William Henry Gregory|William H.

Of this Law, Mitchel wrote that \"it is the [[able-bodied]] idler only who is to be fed\u2014if he attempted to till but one [[Rood (unit)|rood]] of ground, he dies\". This simple method of ejectment was called \"passing paupers through the workhouse\"\u2014a man went in, a pauper came out.{{sfn|Mitchel|1996|p = 16}} These factors combined to drive thousands of people off the land: 90,000 in 1849, and 104,000 in 1850.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn 1849 the [[Encumbered Estates' Court|Encumbered Estates Act]] allowed landlord estates to be auctioned off upon the petition of creditors. Estates with debts were then auctioned off at low prices. Wealthy British speculators purchased the lands and \"took a harsh view\" of the tenant farmers who continued renting. The rents were raised and tenants evicted to create large cattle grazing pastures. Between 1849 and 1854, some 50,000 families were evicted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170107041845/http://www.historicalballinrobe.com/page_id__166.aspx  Ballinrobe Local History: The Encumbered Estates Acts, 1848 and 1849]</ref><ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/240915  Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives (review) David W.

(''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).]]\n\nRecords show that Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782\u201383, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=11}} No such export ban happened in the 1840s.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=354}}\n\nThroughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food. In the magazine ''[[History Ireland]]'' (1997, issue 5, pp.&nbsp;32\u201336), [[Christine Kinealy]], a Great Hunger scholar, lecturer, and [[Drew University]] professor, relates her findings: Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases. She also writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine. This food was shipped from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland: Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport. A wide variety of commodities left Ireland during 1847, including peas, beans, onions, rabbits, salmon, oysters, herring, lard, honey, tongues, animal skins, rags, shoes, soap, glue, and seed.\n\nOne of the most shocking export figures concern butter. Butter was shipped in firkins, each one holding {{convert|1|firkin|impgal l|0|disp=out|abbr=off}}. In the first nine months of 1847, {{convert|56557|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were exported from Ireland to Bristol, and {{convert|34852|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were shipped to Liverpool, which correlates with {{convert|822681|impgal|l|abbr=off}} of butter exported to England from Ireland during nine months of the worst year of the Famine.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=10}} The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=165}}\n\nWriting in 1849, English poet and social reformer [[Ebenezer Jones]] wrote that \"In the year A.D. 1846, there were exported from Ireland, 3,266,193 quarters of wheat, barley and oats, besides flour, beans, peas, and rye; 186,483 cattle, 6,363 calves, 259,257 sheep, 180,827 swine; (food, that is, in the shape of meat and bread, for about one half of the Irish population), and yet this very year of A.D. 1846 was pre-eminently, owing to a land monopoly, the famine year for the Irish people.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Ebenezer |title=The Land Monopoly: The Suffering and Demoralization Caused by It, and the Justice & Expediency of Its Abolition |date=1849 |publisher=Chas.

Only by selling food, some of which would inevitably be exported, could a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|\"virtuous circle\"]] be created whereby the rents and rates would be paid, and the workhouses funded.

He suggested that it has been carefully inculcated by the British Press \"that the moment Ireland fell into distress, she became an abject beggar at England's gate, and that she even craved alms from all mankind\". He affirmed that in Ireland no one ever asked alms or favours of any kind from England or any other nation, but that it was England herself that begged for Ireland.

Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over \u00a34 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, there had been some clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=95}} According to [[James S. Donnelly, Jr.]], it is impossible to be sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=155}}\n\nDonnelly considered this to be an underestimate, and if the figures were to include the number pressured into \"voluntary\" surrenders during the whole period (1846\u20131854), the figure would almost certainly exceed half a million persons.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 156}} While Helen Litton says there were also thousands of \"voluntary\" surrenders, she notes also that there was \"precious little voluntary about them\". In some cases, tenants were persuaded to accept a small sum of money to leave their homes, \"cheated into believing the workhouse would take them in\".{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 95}}\n\nWest Clare was one of the worst areas for evictions, where landlords turned thousands of families out and demolished their derisory cabins. Captain Kennedy in April 1848 estimated that 1,000 houses, with an average of six people to each, had been levelled since November.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=96}} The Mahon family of Strokestown House evicted 3,000 people in 1847, and were still able to dine on lobster soup.{{sfn|Gibney|2008|p=55}}\n\nAfter Clare, the worst area for evictions was County Mayo, accounting for 10% of all evictions between 1849 and 1854. [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan]], who owned over {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}, was among the worst evicting landlords. He was quoted as saying that \"he would not breed paupers to pay priests\". Having turned out in the parish of Ballinrobe over 2,000 tenants alone, he then used the cleared land as grazing farms.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 98}} In 1848, the Marquis of Sligo owed \u00a31,650 to Westport Union; he was also an evicting landlord, though he claimed to be selective, saying that he was only getting rid of the idle and dishonest. Altogether, he cleared about 25% of his tenants.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nIn 1847, [[Bishop of Meath]], [[Thomas Nulty]], described his personal recollection of the evictions in a pastoral letter to his clergy:\n\n{{quote|Seven hundred human beings were driven from their homes in one day and set adrift on the world, to gratify the caprice of one who, before God and man, probably deserved less consideration than the last and least of them ...

The landed proprietors in a circle all around\u2014and for many miles in every direction\u2014warned their tenantry, with threats of their direct vengeance, against the humanity of extending to any of them the hospitality of a single night's shelter ... and in little more than three years, nearly a fourth of them lay quietly in their graves.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\">{{cite journal|last=Falc'her-Poyroux|first=Erick|title=The Great Irish Famine in Songs|journal=Revue Fran\u00e7aise de Civilisation Britannique [Online]|volume=XIX|issue=2|pages=157\u2013172|date=2014|issn=2429-4373|doi=10.4000/rfcb.277|doi-access=free}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Litton, evictions might have taken place earlier but for fear of the secret societies. However, they were now greatly weakened by the Famine. Revenge still occasionally took place, with seven landlords being shot, six fatally, during the autumn and winter of 1847. Ten other occupiers of land, though without tenants, were also murdered, she says.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=99}}\n\nOne such landlord reprisal occurred in West [[Roscommon]]. The \"notorious\" landlord Maj Denis Mahon enforced thousands of his tenants into eviction before the end of 1847, with an estimated 60 percent decline in population in some [[parish]]es. He was shot dead in that year.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/pioneering-study-charts-population-fall-since-famine-1.588108 Pioneering study charts population fall since Famine]</ref> In East Roscommon, \"where conditions were more benign\", the estimated decline in population was under 10 percent.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\n[[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], alarmed at the number of landlords being shot and that this might mean rebellion, asked for special powers. Lord John Russell was not sympathetic to this appeal. Lord Clarendon believed that the landlords themselves were mostly responsible for the tragedy in the first place, saying that \"It is quite true that landlords in England would not like to be shot like hares and partridges ... but neither does any landlord in England turn out fifty persons at once and burn their houses over their heads, giving them no provision for the future.\" The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847|Crime and Outrage Act]] was passed in December 1847 as a compromise, and additional troops were sent to Ireland.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\", described by Donnelly as a \"vicious amendment to the Irish poor law\", had been a successful Tory amendment to the Whig poor-relief bill which became law in early June 1847, where its potential as an estate-clearing device was widely recognised in parliament, although not in advance.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=159}} At first, the poor law commissioners and inspectors viewed the clause as a valuable instrument for a more cost-effective administration of public relief, but the drawbacks soon became apparent, even from an administrative perspective. They would soon view them as little more than murderous from a humanitarian perspective. According to Donnelly, it became obvious that the quarter-acre clause was \"indirectly a death-dealing instrument\".{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p=110}}\n\n==Emigration==\n{{main|Irish diaspora|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}\n[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''The Emigrants' Farewell'', engraving by [[Henry Doyle]] (1827\u20131893), from [[Mary Frances Cusack]]'s ''Illustrated History of Ireland'', 1868]]\n\nWhile the famine was responsible for a significant increase in emigration from Ireland, of anywhere from 45% to nearly 85% depending on the year and the county, it was not the sole cause. The beginning of mass emigration from Ireland can be traced to the mid-18th century, when some 250,000 people left Ireland over a period of 50 years to settle in the [[New World]]. Irish economist Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million people emigrated during the 30 years between 1815 (when [[Napoleon]] was defeated in [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]) and 1845 (when the Great Famine began).{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1975|p = }} However, during the worst of the famine, emigration reached somewhere around 250,000 in one year alone, with western Ireland seeing the most emigrants.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2007}}\n\nFamilies did not migrate ''en masse'', but younger members of families did, so much so that emigration almost became a [[rite of passage]], as evidenced by the data that show that, unlike similar emigrations throughout world history, women emigrated just as often, just as early, and in the same numbers as men. The emigrants would send remittances (reaching a total of \u00a31,404,000 by 1851) back to family in Ireland, which, in turn, allowed another member of their family to leave.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 371}}\n\nEmigration during the famine years of 1845\u20131850 was primarily to England, Scotland, South Wales, North America, and Australia; one city that experienced a particularly strong influx of Irish immigrants was [[Liverpool]], with at least one quarter of the city's population being Irish-born by 1851.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 268}} Many of those fleeing to the Americas used the well-established [[McCorkell Line]].{{sfn|McCorkell|2010|p = }}\n\n[[File:Population of Ireland and Europe 1750 to 2005.svg|thumb|left|A graph of the populations of Ireland [left axis] and Europe [right axis]{{dubious|date=October 2018}} indexed against date.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Excluding the [[Demography of Scotland|population of Scotland]] and [[Demography of Wales|Wales]] between the 1841 and 1851 censuses the [[Demography of England|population of England]], grew at a similar rate as the decades previous, from 14.8 to 16.7 million.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10061325/cube/TOT_POP Vision of Britain a population through time England], Retrieved 9 August 2013</ref>]]\n\nOf the more than 100,000 Irish that sailed to [[Canada]] in 1847, an estimated one out of five died from disease and malnutrition, including over 5,000 at [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]], an island in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] used to quarantine ships near [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=238}} Overcrowded, poorly maintained, and badly provisioned vessels known as [[coffin ship]]s sailed from small, unregulated harbours in the West of Ireland in contravention of British safety requirements, and mortality rates were high.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=216\u2013217}} The 1851 census reported that more than half the inhabitants of [[Toronto]] were Irish, and, in 1847 alone, 38,000 Irish flooded a city with fewer than 20,000 citizens. Other Canadian cities such as Quebec City, [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] also received large numbers.

However, fearing nationalist insurgencies, the British government placed harsh restrictions on Irish immigration to Canada after 1847, resulting in larger influxes to the United States.\n\nIn America, most Irish became city-dwellers; with little money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships they came on landed in.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=267}} By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in [[Boston]], New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In addition, Irish populations became prevalent in some American mining communities.\n\nThe famine marked the beginning of the depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century. Population had increased by 13\u201314% in the first three decades of the 19th century; between 1831 and 1841, population grew by 5%. Application of [[Thomas Malthus]]'s idea of population expanding geometrically while resources increase arithmetically was popular during the famines of 1817 and 1822. By the 1830s, they were seen as overly simplistic, and Ireland's problems were seen \"less as an excess of population than as a lack of [[capital investment]]\".{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }} The population of Ireland was increasing no faster than that of England, which suffered no equivalent catastrophe.

They recorded 21,770 total deaths from starvation in the previous decade, and 400,720 deaths from disease. Listed diseases were fever, [[diphtheria]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]], and [[influenza]], with the first two being the main killers (222,021 and 93,232). The commissioners acknowledged that their figures were incomplete and that the true number of deaths was probably higher:\n\n<blockquote>The greater the amount of destitution of mortality&nbsp;... the less will be the amount of recorded deaths derived through any household form;\u2014for not only were whole families swept away by disease&nbsp;... but whole villages were effaced from off the land.</blockquote>\n\nLater historians agree that the 1851 death tables \"were flawed and probably under-estimated the level of mortality\".{{sfn|Killen|1995|pp = 250\u2013252}}{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=167}} The combination of institutional and figures provided by individuals gives \"an incomplete and biased count\" of fatalities during the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2006|p=3}}\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, referencing the work of W.

Of the nutritional deficiency diseases, the most commonly experienced were starvation and [[marasmus]], as well as a condition at the time called dropsy.

The policy, however, would soon be [[Plan of Campaign|suppressed]].

With the reduction in the rate of [[homelessness]] and the increased physical and political networks eroding the [[landlordism]] system, the severity of [[Irish Famine (1879)|the following shorter famine]] would be limited.<ref name=\"muse.jhu.edu\"/><ref name=historyplace/><ref name=bitesize/>\n\nAccording to the linguist Erick Falc'her-Poyroux, surprisingly, for a country renowned for its rich musical heritage, only a small number of folk songs can be traced back to the demographic and cultural catastrophe brought about by the Great Famine, and he infers from this that the subject was generally avoided for decades among poorer people as it brought back too many sorrowful memories. Also, large areas of the country became uninhabited and the folk song collectors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries did not collect the songs they heard in the Irish language, as the language of the peasantry was often regarded as dead, or \"not delicate enough for educated ears\". Of the songs that have survived probably the best known is [[Skibbereen (song)|Skibbereen]]. Emigration has been an important sources of inspiration for songs of the Irish during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\"/> Since the 1970s a number of songs about the famine have been written and recorded, such as \"[[The Fields of Athenry]]\" by [[Pete St. John]], \"[[Famine]]\" by [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and \"Thousands are Sailing\" by [[the Pogues]].\n\n==Analysis of the government's role==\n===Contemporary===\nContemporary opinion was sharply critical of the Russell government's response to and management of the crisis. From the start, there were accusations that the government failed to grasp the magnitude of the disaster. Sir James Graham, who had served as [[Home Secretary]] in Sir Robert Peel's late government, wrote to Peel that, in his opinion, \"the real extent and magnitude of the Irish difficulty are underestimated by the Government, and cannot be met by measures within the strict rule of economical science\".{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=80}}\n\nThis criticism was not confined to outside critics. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: \"I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.\"{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=381}} Also in 1849, the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6p in the pound levy on all rateable properties in Ireland.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|pp = 254\u2013260}} Twisleton testified that \"comparatively trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of permitting its miserable fellow subjects to die of starvation\". According to [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]] in his book ''The Irish Famine'', the government spent \u00a37 million for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, \"representing less than half of one percent of the British [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] over five years. Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the \u00a320 million compensation given to [[Caribbean|West Indian]] slave-owners in the 1830s.\"{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }}\n\nOther critics maintained that, even after the government recognised the scope of the crisis, it failed to take sufficient steps to address it. John Mitchel, one of the leaders of the Young Ireland Movement, wrote in 1860:\n\n<blockquote>I have called it an artificial famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a \"dispensation of Providence\"; and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nStill other critics saw reflected in the government's response its attitude to the so-called \"[[Irish Question]]\". [[Nassau Senior]], an economics professor at [[Oxford University]], wrote that the Famine \"would not kill more than one million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do any good\".{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }} In 1848, Denis Shine Lawlor suggested that Russell was a student of the Elizabethan poet [[Edmund Spenser]], who had calculated \"how far English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out by Irish starvation\".{{sfn|Donnelly|1995|p = }} Charles Trevelyan, the civil servant with most direct responsibility for the government's handling of the famine, described it in 1848 as \"a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence\", which laid bare \"the deep and inveterate root of social evil\"; he affirmed that the Famine was \"the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected. God grant that the generation to which this opportunity has been offered may rightly perform its part...\"{{sfn|Trevelyan|1848|p = }}\n\n===Historical===\nChristine Kinealy has written that \"the major tragedy of the Irish Famine of 1845\u201352 marked a watershed in modern Irish history. Its occurrence, however, was neither inevitable nor unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p = xv}} The underlying factors which combined to cause the famine were aggravated by an inadequate government response. As Kinealy notes:\n\n{{quote|[T]he government had to do something to help alleviate the suffering, the particular nature of the actual response, especially following 1846, suggests a more covert agenda and motivation. As the Famine progressed, it became apparent that the government was using its information not merely to help it formulate its relief policies, but also as an opportunity to facilitate various long-desired changes within Ireland. These included population control and the consolidation of property through various means, including emigration ... Despite the overwhelming evidence of prolonged distress caused by successive years of potato blight, the underlying philosophy of the relief efforts was that they should be kept to a minimalist level; in fact they actually decreased as the Famine progressed.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=353}}}}\n\nSeveral writers single out the decision of the government to permit the continued export of food from Ireland as suggestive of the policy-makers' attitudes. [[Leon Uris]] suggested that \"there was ample food within Ireland\", while all the Irish-bred cattle were being shipped off to England.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=16}} The following exchange appeared in Act IV of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Man and Superman]]'':\n\n{{poemquote|MALONE. He will get over it all right enough. Men thrive better on disappointments in love than on disappointments in money. I daresay you think that sordid; but I know what I'm talking about. My father died of starvation in Ireland in the black 47, Maybe you've heard of it.\nVIOLET. The Famine?\nMALONE. [with smouldering passion] No, the starvation. When a country is full of food, and exporting it, there can be no famine. My father was starved dead; and I was starved out to America in my mother's arms. English rule drove me and mine out of Ireland. Well, you can keep Ireland. I and my like are coming back to buy England; and we'll buy the best of it. I want no middle class properties and no middle class women for Hector. That's straightforward isn't it, like yourself?{{sfn|Shaw|1903|p = }}}}\n\nSome also pointed to the structure of the British Empire as a contributing factor. [[James Anthony Froude]] wrote that \"England governed Ireland for what she deemed her own interest, making her calculations on the gross balance of her trade ledgers, and leaving moral obligations aside, as if right and wrong had been blotted out of the statute book of the Universe.\"{{sfn|MacManus|1921|p=492}} Dennis Clark, an [[Irish American|Irish-American]] historian and critic of empire, claimed the famine was \"the culmination of generations of neglect, misrule and repression. It was an epic of English colonial cruelty and inadequacy. For the landless cabin dwellers it meant emigration or extinction...\"{{sfn|Clark|1982|p = }}\n\n===Genocide question{{anchor|Genocide}}===\n{{see also|Genocides in history#British Empire}}\n[[File:An gorta Mor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''Ireland's Holocaust'' mural on the Ballymurphy Road, [[Belfast]]. \"An Gorta M\u00f3r, Britain's genocide by starvation, Ireland's holocaust 1845\u20131849, over 1,500,000 deaths\".]]\nThe famine remains a controversial event in Irish history. Debate and discussion on the British government's response to the failure of the potato crop in Ireland, the exportation of food crops and livestock, the subsequent large-scale starvation, and whether or not this constituted [[genocide]], remains a historically and politically charged issue.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]] included the famine in the \"Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum\" for its [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] schools.{{refn|Approved by the New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education on 10 September 1996, for inclusion in the Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum at the secondary level. Revision submitted 11/26/98.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=1}}|group=fn}} The curriculum was pushed by various Irish\nAmerican political groups and drafted by the librarian James Mullin. Following criticism of the curriculum, the New Jersey Holocaust Commission requested statements from two academics that the Irish famine was genocide, which was eventually provided by law professors [[Charles E. Rice]] and [[Francis A. Boyle]], who had not been previously known for studying Irish history.{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} They concluded that the British government deliberately pursued a race- and ethnicity-based policy aimed at destroying the Irish people and that the policy of mass starvation amounted to genocide per the [[Genocide Convention|Hague Convention of 1948]].{{refn|\"Clearly, during the years 1845 to 1850, the British government pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland with intent to destroy in substantial part the national, ethnic and racial group commonly known as the Irish People ... Therefore, during the years 1845 to 1850 the British government knowingly pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland that constituted acts of genocide against the Irish people within the meaning of Article II (c) of the 1948 [Hague] [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]].\"{{sfn|Ritschel|1996}}|group=fn}}\n\nJournalist Peter Duffy writes that \"The government's crime, which deserves to blacken its name forever\", was rooted \"in the effort to regenerate Ireland\" through \"landlord-engineered replacement of tillage plots with grazing lands\" that \"took precedence over the obligation to provide food ... for its starving citizens. It is little wonder that the policy looked to many people like genocide.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|pp=297\u2013298}} James S. Donnelly, Jr., a historian at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], wrote in his book, ''Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland'':\n\n<blockquote>I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed in a major way to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority ... And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during and as a result of the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da disagreed that the famine was genocide. He argues that \"genocide includes murderous intent, and it must be said that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish\", and also that most people in [[Whitehall]] \"hoped for better times for Ireland\". Additionally, he states that the claim of genocide overlooks \"the enormous challenge facing relief agencies, both central and local, public and private\".{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} Edward Lengel claims that views of the Irish as racially inferior, and for this reason significantly responsible for their circumstances, gained purchase in Great Britain during and immediately after the famine, especially through influential publications such as ''The Medical Times'' and ''The Times''.{{sfn|Lengel|2002|pp=12, 48, 104}}\n\nThe Great Famine in Ireland has been compared to the ''[[Holodomor]]'' (\"hunger plague\") that took place in the [[Ukraine]] under [[Stalin]] in 1932,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|title=Holodomor and Gorta M\u00f3r|publisher=Anthem Press|accessdate=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120152317/http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|archive-date=20 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> which has been the subject of [[Holodomor genocide question|similar controversy and debate]].\n\nAccording to [[Liam Kennedy (historian)|Liam Kennedy]], \"virtually all historians of Ireland\" reject the genocide allegations.

Easton]] (1856\u20131915) and a group of investors. It derived its name from the [[District of Columbia]], where it was headquartered.<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\">{{cite web|title=Edward Easton|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bilton|first=Lynn|title=Hail, Columbia: A fresh book at last gives Edward Easton and his Graphophone company their due|url=http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|accessdate=January 22, 2014|year=1998}}</ref> At first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison [[phonograph]]s and [[phonograph cylinder]]s in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, \"Heinie\", which is a duet by [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Byron G. Harlan]]. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|right|thumb|A Columbia type AT cylinder [[graphophone]] was produced in 1898.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last=Hazelcorn|first=Howard|title=A Collector's Guide to the Columbia Spring-Wound Cylinder Graphophone|publisher=Antique Phonograph Monthly|year=1976|edition=1|pages=10, 13}}</ref>]]\n\nColumbia began selling [[gramophone record|disc records]] (invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]]) and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their \"Toy Graphophone\" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]].

Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company.

Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums.

He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America.

This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single.

Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982.

As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903.

For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company. The Columbia Records factory in Bridgeport (which closed in 1964)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard (Columbia Prepares to Close Plant)|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4|accessdate=June 24, 2013|date=September 7, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=4\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> was converted into an apartment building called Columbia Towers.<ref>[http://columbiatowers.com/Default.htm Columbia Towers Bridgeport CT].

Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>\n\nAs [[southern gospel]] developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record [[Charles Davis Tillman]]. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.\n\nDuring the 1940s Columbia had a contract with [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra helped boost Columbia in revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs with Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia included [[Benny Goodman]] (signed from RCA Victor), [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]] (both signed from Decca), [[Eddy Duchin]], [[Ray Noble]] (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), [[Kate Smith]], [[Mildred Bailey]], and [[Will Bradley]].\n\nIn 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/ | title=Columbia Records paperwork collection}}</ref> and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=60|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1948 saw the first classical LP [[Mendelssohn Violin Concerto (Nathan Milstein album)|Nathan Milstein's recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto]].

Some, like opera tenor (''sic''), Ezio Pinza, would go to Columbia...\"</ref>\n\n===The LP record (1948\u20131959)===\n\nColumbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America. This was the result of legal maneuvers which led to the creation of EMI in the early 1930s.\n\nWhile this happened, starting in late 1961, both the mono and the stereo labels of domestic Columbia releases started carrying a small \"CBS\" at the top of the label. This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982.

The oldest and most influential source for these is the apocryphal ''[[Gospel of James]]'', first written in [[Koine Greek]] around the middle of the second century AD.

The couple meet at the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] of [[Jerusalem]] and embrace. They are aware of Anne's pregnancy, of which they have been separately informed by an archangel. This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here.\n\nHer emblem is a door.<ref name=crawley/> She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.<ref name=\"Fongemie\" />\n\nAnne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.<ref>Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.</ref> Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.\n\n===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===\nThe role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]].

She joins her daughter [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and a young boy who will later become known as [[John the Baptist]] in caring for the injured hand of Jesus.\n\n===Iconography===\nThe subject of Joachim and Anne ''[[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|The Meeting at the Golden Gate]]'' was a regular component of artistic cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]]. The couple meet at the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] of [[Jerusalem]] and embrace. They are aware of Anne's pregnancy, of which they have been separately informed by an archangel. This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here.\n\nHer emblem is a door.<ref name=crawley/> She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.<ref name=\"Fongemie\" />\n\nAnne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.<ref>Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.</ref> Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.\n\n===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===\nThe role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]. Another typical subject has Anne teaching the Virgin Mary the Scriptures (see gallery below).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Faras Saint Anne (detail).jpg|Coptic, 8th century, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]\nFile:Anna Selbdritt 003.jpg|German, 15th century.

Its asphalt runway, 10/28, is {{convert|10,000|by|150|ft}}.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nThe airport recently completed Phase II of a project that expanded the terminal, apron and parking lots. The project will cost about $18 million. The airport has six gates that can handle [[Boeing 757]]s, [[Boeing 737]]s, [[Bombardier Dash 8 Q400]]s, [[Airbus A319]]s, [[Canadair]] [[CRJ 200]]s, [[CRJ 700]]s and [[Embraer 170]]s. Like other Colorado airports serving ski resorts, there are no [[jetbridges]], only open air airstairs. The private ramp can handle up to 30 private jets. In the winter months larger private jets such as the [[Boeing 737]] cannot be parked due to lack of space and must depart after deplaning passengers.\n\n==Airport procedures==\nThe airport has no [[Air Traffic Control Tower]]. All aircraft are on a [[CTAF]] (123.0) and/or [[UNICOM|Unicom]].  All aircraft receive approach control services from the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center. Gates and aircraft parking slots can be assigned via the airport operation radio communication channel. Jet A fuel is provided by the [[Fixed-base operator|FBO]] (fixed-base operator), Atlantic Aviation. All aircraft departing runway 28 make a right or left turn to avoid the populated area of Hayden. Runway 10 has an Instrument Landing System (ILS). Snow and low ceilings during winter months cause some aircraft to [[Detour|divert]] to other airports including [[Denver International Airport]].\n\n==Airport operations==\nIn the year ending December 31, 2018 the airport had 11,474 aircraft operations, average 31 per day: 47% [[general aviation]], 18% scheduled airline, 34% [[air taxi]], and <1% military. Eight aircraft were then based at this airport: four single-engine and four multi-engine.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nThe airport has two [[Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting|ARFF]] [[truck]]s in the operations garage that are run by full-time and seasonal firefighters.  They operate ARFF index C from December to March, and ARFF index B from April to November.

Its asphalt runway, 10/28, is {{convert|10,000|by|150|ft}}.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nThe airport recently completed Phase II of a project that expanded the terminal, apron and parking lots. The project will cost about $18 million. The airport has six gates that can handle [[Boeing 757]]s, [[Boeing 737]]s, [[Bombardier Dash 8 Q400]]s, [[Airbus A319]]s, [[Canadair]] [[CRJ 200]]s, [[CRJ 700]]s and [[Embraer 170]]s. Like other Colorado airports serving ski resorts, there are no [[jetbridges]], only open air airstairs. The private ramp can handle up to 30 private jets. In the winter months larger private jets such as the [[Boeing 737]] cannot be parked due to lack of space and must depart after deplaning passengers.\n\n==Airport procedures==\nThe airport has no [[Air Traffic Control Tower]]. All aircraft are on a [[CTAF]] (123.0) and/or [[UNICOM|Unicom]].  All aircraft receive approach control services from the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center. Gates and aircraft parking slots can be assigned via the airport operation radio communication channel. Jet A fuel is provided by the [[Fixed-base operator|FBO]] (fixed-base operator), Atlantic Aviation. All aircraft departing runway 28 make a right or left turn to avoid the populated area of Hayden. Runway 10 has an Instrument Landing System (ILS). Snow and low ceilings during winter months cause some aircraft to [[Detour|divert]] to other airports including [[Denver International Airport]].\n\n==Airport operations==\nIn the year ending December 31, 2018 the airport had 11,474 aircraft operations, average 31 per day: 47% [[general aviation]], 18% scheduled airline, 34% [[air taxi]], and <1% military. Eight aircraft were then based at this airport: four single-engine and four multi-engine.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nThe airport has two [[Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting|ARFF]] [[truck]]s in the operations garage that are run by full-time and seasonal firefighters.  They operate ARFF index C from December to March, and ARFF index B from April to November. The ARFF trucks are staffed by [[firefighter]]s when a scheduled [[flight]] is arriving or departing with more than 10 [[passengers]]. Local fire departments, like The North Routt Fire Protection District and the West Routt Fire Protection District, can respond to the airport if [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] is needed.

Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]] after that aircraft was rejected by the French military in favor of the [[Fouga Magister]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], accessed under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. The aircraft's performance compared to existing propeller-powered types initially attracted attention, and a U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited and most of the production run went to the military as [[liaison aircraft]].<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe development of modern-style center-aisle business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (Utility-Cargo Experimental) and smaller UTX (Utility-Trainer Experimental). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal \"fly-off\" winner-take-all competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft privately, without the aid of government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes, and the requirements attracted significant interest. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[McDonnell Aircraft]] both began development of UCX aircraft, while [[North American Aviation]] pursued the UTX requirement.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]] had a [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|7650|lb|t}}, initially powered by two [[Turbom\u00e9ca Marbor\u00e9]] [[turbojet]]s of {{convert|880|lbf|kN}} thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to {{convert|1058|lbf|kN}} units.

The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MTOW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]] after that aircraft was rejected by the French military in favor of the [[Fouga Magister]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], accessed under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. The aircraft's performance compared to existing propeller-powered types initially attracted attention, and a U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited and most of the production run went to the military as [[liaison aircraft]].<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe development of modern-style center-aisle business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (Utility-Cargo Experimental) and smaller UTX (Utility-Trainer Experimental). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal \"fly-off\" winner-take-all competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft privately, without the aid of government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes, and the requirements attracted significant interest.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

Baltimore County is part of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], which stretches from Virginia northward to [[Boston]]. Baltimore County hosts a diversified economy, with particular emphasis on education, government, and health care.\n\nThe county is home to multiple universities, including [[Goucher College]], [[Stevenson University]] (formerly Villa Julie College), [[Towson University]], and [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]].{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Baltimore\" derives from [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] (1605\u20131675), the proprietor of the new colony in the [[Province of Maryland]], and the town of Baltimore in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. The earliest known documentary record of the county is dated January 12, 1659, when a [[writ]] was issued on behalf of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] to its sheriff.<ref>Located in the [[Maryland State Archives]] in the Hall of Records of the state capital of [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]],&nbsp;</ref> The official founding of the county came in 1659, among the now 23 counties of the State of Maryland. This assumes that a certain amount of organization and appointments in the mid-17th century had already occurred. Previously, (old) Baltimore County was known more as a geographical entity than a political one, with its territorial limits including most of northeastern Maryland, which was then the northwestern frontier of the [[Province of Maryland|Province]] and included the present-day jurisdictions of [[Baltimore City]], [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil]] and [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford Counties]], as well as parts of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]], [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] and [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent Counties]].\n\nIn 1674, a proclamation of the Proprietor established the then-extensive boundary lines for old Baltimore County. Over the next century, various segments of the old county were sliced off as population and settlements increased in fringe regions. A portion of northeastern Baltimore County, as well as a portion of northwestern [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent County]], was split off to create [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]]. In 1748, a portion of western Baltimore County, as well as a portion of [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] to the south, were split off to create [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. In 1773, Harford County to the east was split off, and in 1837 another part of western Baltimore County was combined with a part of eastern [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] to create [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]]. After the adjustment of Baltimore County's southern boundary with [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], stated to be the upper Middle and Western Branches of the [[Patapsco River]] in 1727, a portion of the County's northwestern area was designated in 1838 as the \"Western District\" or \"Howard District\" of Arundel and in 1851 was officially separated to form [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]].\n\nBefore 1674, Baltimore County court sessions were held in private residences, according to sketchy documentary evidence. In 1674, the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed \"An Act for erecting a Court-house and Prison in each County within this Province\". The site of the courthouse, jail and county seat for Baltimore County was evidently \"Old Baltimore\" near the [[Bush River (Maryland)|Bush River]] on land that in 1773 became part of Harford County.\n\nThe exact location of Old Baltimore was lost. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] (APG), a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] weapons testing facility. APG's Cultural Resource Management Program attempted to find Old Baltimore, contracting with R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates (Goodwin). Goodwin first performed historical and archival work and coordinated with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore. APG's Explosive Ordnance Disposal of Army personnel defused any unexploded ordnance. In 1997\u20131998. Goodwin dug 420 test pits, uncovering artifacts including a [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] farthing coin, and French and English gun flints. An unearthed brick foundation proved to be the remains of the tavern owned by colonist James Phillips. Another prominent landholder in Old Baltimore was William Osbourne, who operated the ferry across the Bush River.\n\nIn his article \"Migrations of Baltimore Town\", Reverend George Armistead Leakin related a letter he had received from Dr. George I. Hays. In that letter, Dr. Hays related an account of a raid by the [[Susquehannocks]] who took William Osbourne's oldest son. Osbourne was unsuccessful in an attempt to rescue the boy. The boy was never seen by Osbourne again.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1683, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed \"An Act for Advancement of Trade\" to \"establish towns, ports, and places of trade, within the province.\" One of the towns established by the act was \"on Bush River, on Town Land, near the Court-House\".  The courthouse on the Bush River referenced in the 1683 Act was in all likelihood the one created by the 1674 Act. \"Old Baltimore\" was in existence as early as 1674, but no documents describe what may have preceded it.\n\nBy 1695, the \"Old Baltimore\" courthouse had evidently been abandoned. County justices put the site up for sale. Apparently a new courthouse at \"Simm's Choice\" on the Baltimore County side of [[Gunpowder River|Little Gunpowder Falls]] had been under construction since 1692. In 1700, builder Michael Judd sold it to the county justices. This change of location, away from the Bush River area, reflects the growing economic and political importance of the Gunpowder region. During the next decade, the county seat moved to [[Joppa, Maryland|Joppa]].\n\nBy 1724, the legislative assembly authorized Thomas Tolley, Capt. John Taylor, Daniel Scott, Lancelot Todd, and John Stokes to purchase 20 acres from \"Taylor's Choice,\" a tract named after John Taylor. The assembly's ordinance directed that the land be divided into 40 lots with streets and alleys to accompany the courthouse and jail erected previously. By 1750, about 50 houses (including a few large two-story brick structures), a church (St. John's Anglican Parish), a courthouse, three stone warehouses, inns, taverns, stores, a public wharf and a \"gallows-tree\" with an \"Amen Corner\" with pillories and whipping posts (now located northeast of the City of Baltimore near present-day suburban \"Joppatowne\" off [[Harford Road]]) existed.\n\nA new port and wharfing site, [[Elkridge Landing]], on the upper [[Patapsco River]]'s Western Branch, became prosperous in the 18th century. It was established on the \"falls\" of the river, below the rapids and rocks, where the river was deep enough for loaded sailing merchantmen. The landing was a designated \"port of entry\" and was the terminus of several \"rolling roads\" on which horse or oxen-drawn [[hogshead]]s (huge barrels) packed with tobacco were wheeled down to the Landing/port to be loaded on ships sailing for London and Europe. Gradually the site silted-up from soil erosion and poor farming cultivation on the upper Patapsco, and the maritime economy of the Landing faded. In the 19th century, it became an important stop on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and the main north-south East Coast highway for wagons and carriages. Still, later it was on Washington Boulevard (designated [[United States Route 1|U.S. Route 1]]) by 1926.\n\nWith a bit of financial pressure, and after paying for the cost of a new courthouse (300 pounds sterling), dominant business, commercial and political residents of the Town of Baltimore were able to have the [[Maryland General Assembly]] relocate the county seat to their growing port town. In 1768, following receipt of petitions for and against the relocation, the General Assembly passed an Act that moved the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://aomol.msa.maryland.gov/000001/000061/html/am61p--86.html|title=Baltimore Town Made the County Seat|journal=Maryland State Archives (Archives of Maryland Online)|volume=61|pages=86\u201387|publisher=Maryland State Archives}}</ref> The first courthouse was constructed in 1768 at a new \"Courthouse Square\" (today on [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert Street]], between East Lexington and East Fayette Streets).\n\nThe Town of Baltimore, [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown]] and [[Fell's Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] were [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the ''[[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]]'' in 1796\u20131797. The city remained a part of surrounding Baltimore County and continued to serve as its [[county seat]] from 1768\u20131851.<ref name=\"Maryland Manual\">{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/html/bcity.html| title=Baltimore, Maryland\u2014Government| work=Maryland Manual On-Line: A Guide to Maryland Government| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=October 23, 2008| access-date=October 27, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919221820/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/html/bcity.html| archive-date= September 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe site of the courthouse is now \"[[Battle Monument|Battle Monument Square]]\", constructed 1815\u20131822 to commemorate the city and county defense in the [[War of 1812]], including the bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet in the [[Patapsco River]], the two-day stand-off in fortifications dug east of the city on Loudenschlager's Hill (now \"Hampstead Hill\" in today's [[Patterson Park]]) and the earlier [[Battle of North Point]] in \"Godly Woods\" on the \"Patapsco Neck\" peninsula in the southeastern portion of the county, during September 12\u201314, 1814. These events have been commemorated ever since by [[Defenders Day|Defenders' Day]], an annual city, county, and state official holiday on September 12.\n\nA second city-county courthouse constructed in 1805\u20131809 was moved to the western side of the Square at North Calvert and East Lexington. A third courthouse including the lower magistrates, commissioners, [[Government of Maryland#District Court|district]] and [[Maryland Circuit Courts|circuit courts]], orphans (inheritances/wills) court, small claims court and the old [[Courts of Maryland|Supreme Bench of Baltimore City]] was constructed on the entire western block of [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert]], East Lexington, East Fayette and [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|Saint Paul]] Streets from 1896 to 1900. In 1985 this building was renamed the [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. City Circuit Courthouse]], for the famous Baltimorean and leader of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Clarence M. Mitchell Jr.]] (1911\u20131984), reputed to be the \"101st U.S. Senator\".<ref name=\"BCHS\">[[Historical marker]], Towson Courthouse, Baltimore County Historical Society.</ref>\n\nIn 1816, the City of Baltimore annexed from Baltimore County several parcels of land known as the \"Precincts\" on its west, north, east and southwest sides.  The County separated from the City (which it surrounds on the east, north, and west) on July 4, 1851, as a result of the adoption of the 1851 second state constitution. Baltimore became one of the few \"[[Independent city (United States)|independent cities]]\" in the United States, putting it on the same level with the state's other 23 counties and granting limited \"[[home rule]]\" powers outside the authority of the Maryland General Assembly.\n\n[[Towson, Maryland|Towsontown]] was voted in a referendum by the voting citizens as the new \"county seat\" on February 13, 1854. The City of Baltimore continued annexing land from the county, extending its western and northern boundaries in 1888. The factory and business owners in the eastern industrial communities of [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] and [[Highlandtown, Baltimore|Highlandtown]] resisted and opposed annexation, but were annexed 30 years later. The last major annexation took place in 1918\u20131919, which again took territory from the County on all three sides (west, north, and east) as well as to the south for the first time from [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], along the south shores of the [[Patapsco River]].\n\nA new [[Baltimore County Courthouse]] was authorized to be built facing Washington Avenue, between Chesapeake and Pennsylvania Avenues to replace the previous courthouse and governmental offices then centered for near 85 years in the City, which had been the official \"county seat\" since just before the [[American Revolution]]. Later surrounded by manicured flower gardens, shrubs and curved walkways, the historical landmark is built of local [[limestone]] and [[marble]]. It was completed and dedicated in 1855. Wings and annexes were added in 1910, 1923 and 1958. By the 1970s, the County's legal system and governmental offices had grown so much that a separate modernistic \"County Courts Building\" was erected to the west behind the old Courthouse with its annexes, separated by a paved plaza which is used for employee/visitors relaxations and official ceremonies.\n\nA constitutional amendment to the 1867 Maryland Constitution was approved by referendum in 1948, prohibiting any future annexations without approval from residents in affected territories.\n\nExtensive city-county hostilities came during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and by the 1980s the county's older [[inner suburbs]] faced increasing urban social ills. An atmosphere of cooperation emerged with the drawing of cross-border state assembly districts, organizing of regional government agencies, and increasing state assumption of powers.\n\nThe County has a number of properties and sites of local, state and national historical interest on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Baltimore County, Maryland|\"National Register of Historic Places\"]] which is maintained by the [[National Park Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] by the \"Historic Sites Act\" of August 1935.\n\nSince 1854,[[Towson, Maryland|Towson]] has been the [[county seat]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties|accessdate=2011-06-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|archivedate=May 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Law and government==\nBaltimore County has had a charter government since 1956. The government consists of a [[Baltimore County Executive|County Executive]] and a seven-member [[County council|County Council]]. The County Executive and Council members are elected in years of gubernatorial elections. The County Executive may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.\n\nWithout incorporated cities or towns, the county government provides all local services to its residents, many of which are normally associated with city-type governmental agencies.\n\nIn 1956 the County adopted an \"executive-council\" system of government with \"at large\" representatives, replacing its traditional system of an elected Board of County Commissioners. Since then it has had eleven county executives and one \"acting\" executive, of which ten were [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and two were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. The former [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Spiro T. Agnew]], served as the third executive from 1962 to 1966 and subsequently was elected [[Governor of Maryland]], serving from 1967 to 1969. He was later accused of corruption and bribery while serving as County executive and continuing to accept bribes as the state's governor and as U.S. Vice President. He pleaded \"no contest\" to unprecedented Federal criminal charges. He was forced to resign the Vice Presidency in 1973.\n\nPolitically, Baltimore County leans [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], but not as overwhelmingly as Baltimore City. In general, the northern portions of the county lean Republican, while the southern portion is more Democratic.\n\n===State's attorney===\nThe [[Baltimore County State's Attorney]] is responsible for prosecuting the [[felony]], misdemeanor, and juvenile cases that occur in the county. As of 2017, the State's Attorney was Scott Shellenberger (Democrat). He followed Sandra A. O'Connor, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who served eight terms before retiring in 2006.\n\n===Law enforcement===\nThe [[Baltimore County Police Department]] is responsible for police services. The current head of the department is Chief Melissa Hyatt. <ref>https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/police/chiefsheridanbio.html</ref>\n\nEstablished in the mid-17th century, the Sheriff of Baltimore County was at first filled by county justices from 1662 to 1676. Thereafter the Court submitted three names from which the colonial governor chose a sheriff. Although terms of office initially varied, by 1692, a uniform two-year term was imposed. In 1699 a three-year term with separate commissions was adopted. The sheriff acted as the chief local representative of the Proprietary Government. His duties included the collection of all public taxes and after 1692, the collection of the yearly poll tax of forty pounds of tobacco for the support of the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] ([[Church of England]]) clergy and parishes. A sheriff received a percentage of collected monies, generally about five percent. He also received a yearly salary for duties such as reporting to the governor on affairs within the County, taking/estimating the census periodically, conveying official laws and proprietary requests to the county courts and selecting juries for court sessions. Along with enforcing all provincial laws, he posted new laws in public places. While his primary duty was to serve the Proprietor, the sheriff was aware of problems faced by poor planters and tradesmen. With taxes, yearly quit-rents and other costly expenditures, many of the poorer settlers were unable to pay their obligations when due. The sheriff often extended credit to these planters and paid their immediate obligations out of his own pocket. This lessened the impact of taxes for the poor, who repaid the sheriff after their harvests were brought in.\n\nThe modern [[Baltimore County Sheriff's Department]] is responsible for security of the two major [[Baltimore County Circuit Courthouse|County Circuit Courts]] buildings and various courtrooms elsewhere as well as process and warrant service. Sheriff's Deputies are sworn police officers and share the same powers of the more recently organized County Police Department. As of 2019, the Baltimore County Sheriff is [[Democratic Party United States|Democrat]], R. J. Fisher.\n\n===Fire Department===\nThe Baltimore County Fire Department (B.Co.F.D.)<ref>[http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/fire/index.html Baltimore County Md. Fire Department \u2013 Overview]. Baltimorecountymd.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.</ref> provides fire protection, emergency medical services and emergency rescue services to the county and surrounding areas, including Baltimore City, through mutual-aid pacts with those jurisdictions. The department consists of both paid and volunteer companies that provide services to overlapping territories. Twenty-five career (paid) stations and 28 volunteer stations operate there. More than 1,000 paid personnel and more than 2,000 volunteers serve in the department. The department conducts annual fire inspections on commercial properties, fire investigation and fire prevention education activities as well as water and tactical rescue. The current Chief is Joanne R. Rund who was sworn into the position on July 1 2019.<ref>[https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/News/BaltimoreCountyNow/olszewski-names-fire-chief-announces-other-key-leadership-roles]</ref>\n\n====Fire Department Support====\nCentral Alarmers (Station 155) was a private organization that provided fireground rehab support to firefighters (personal relief stations and refreshments) during large or prolonged incidents in the county's central and eastern regions. This organization merged with the White Marsh Volunteer Fire Company (Station 200) and continues to operate its services as a part of the White Marsh Volunteer Company. Box 234 Association (Station 156) also provides rehab support services to the western and southern regions of the county\n\n===County Executives===\nThe [[Baltimore County Executive]] oversees the executive branch of the County government, which is charged with implementing County law and overseeing the government operations. The current County Executive is [[John A.

[[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]] and is part of the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] and [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]] (a combined statistical area). Baltimore County is part of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], which stretches from Virginia northward to [[Boston]]. Baltimore County hosts a diversified economy, with particular emphasis on education, government, and health care.\n\nThe county is home to multiple universities, including [[Goucher College]], [[Stevenson University]] (formerly Villa Julie College), [[Towson University]], and [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]].{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Baltimore\" derives from [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] (1605\u20131675), the proprietor of the new colony in the [[Province of Maryland]], and the town of Baltimore in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. The earliest known documentary record of the county is dated January 12, 1659, when a [[writ]] was issued on behalf of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] to its sheriff.<ref>Located in the [[Maryland State Archives]] in the Hall of Records of the state capital of [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]],&nbsp;</ref> The official founding of the county came in 1659, among the now 23 counties of the State of Maryland. This assumes that a certain amount of organization and appointments in the mid-17th century had already occurred. Previously, (old) Baltimore County was known more as a geographical entity than a political one, with its territorial limits including most of northeastern Maryland, which was then the northwestern frontier of the [[Province of Maryland|Province]] and included the present-day jurisdictions of [[Baltimore City]], [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil]] and [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford Counties]], as well as parts of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]], [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] and [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent Counties]].\n\nIn 1674, a proclamation of the Proprietor established the then-extensive boundary lines for old Baltimore County. Over the next century, various segments of the old county were sliced off as population and settlements increased in fringe regions. A portion of northeastern Baltimore County, as well as a portion of northwestern [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent County]], was split off to create [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]]. In 1748, a portion of western Baltimore County, as well as a portion of [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] to the south, were split off to create [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. In 1773, Harford County to the east was split off, and in 1837 another part of western Baltimore County was combined with a part of eastern [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] to create [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]]. After the adjustment of Baltimore County's southern boundary with [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], stated to be the upper Middle and Western Branches of the [[Patapsco River]] in 1727, a portion of the County's northwestern area was designated in 1838 as the \"Western District\" or \"Howard District\" of Arundel and in 1851 was officially separated to form [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]].\n\nBefore 1674, Baltimore County court sessions were held in private residences, according to sketchy documentary evidence. In 1674, the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed \"An Act for erecting a Court-house and Prison in each County within this Province\". The site of the courthouse, jail and county seat for Baltimore County was evidently \"Old Baltimore\" near the [[Bush River (Maryland)|Bush River]] on land that in 1773 became part of Harford County.\n\nThe exact location of Old Baltimore was lost. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] (APG), a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] weapons testing facility. APG's Cultural Resource Management Program attempted to find Old Baltimore, contracting with R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates (Goodwin). Goodwin first performed historical and archival work and coordinated with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore. APG's Explosive Ordnance Disposal of Army personnel defused any unexploded ordnance. In 1997\u20131998. Goodwin dug 420 test pits, uncovering artifacts including a [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] farthing coin, and French and English gun flints. An unearthed brick foundation proved to be the remains of the tavern owned by colonist James Phillips. Another prominent landholder in Old Baltimore was William Osbourne, who operated the ferry across the Bush River.\n\nIn his article \"Migrations of Baltimore Town\", Reverend George Armistead Leakin related a letter he had received from Dr. George I. Hays. In that letter, Dr. Hays related an account of a raid by the [[Susquehannocks]] who took William Osbourne's oldest son. Osbourne was unsuccessful in an attempt to rescue the boy. The boy was never seen by Osbourne again.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1683, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed \"An Act for Advancement of Trade\" to \"establish towns, ports, and places of trade, within the province.\" One of the towns established by the act was \"on Bush River, on Town Land, near the Court-House\".  The courthouse on the Bush River referenced in the 1683 Act was in all likelihood the one created by the 1674 Act. \"Old Baltimore\" was in existence as early as 1674, but no documents describe what may have preceded it.\n\nBy 1695, the \"Old Baltimore\" courthouse had evidently been abandoned. County justices put the site up for sale. Apparently a new courthouse at \"Simm's Choice\" on the Baltimore County side of [[Gunpowder River|Little Gunpowder Falls]] had been under construction since 1692. In 1700, builder Michael Judd sold it to the county justices. This change of location, away from the Bush River area, reflects the growing economic and political importance of the Gunpowder region. During the next decade, the county seat moved to [[Joppa, Maryland|Joppa]].\n\nBy 1724, the legislative assembly authorized Thomas Tolley, Capt. John Taylor, Daniel Scott, Lancelot Todd, and John Stokes to purchase 20 acres from \"Taylor's Choice,\" a tract named after John Taylor. The assembly's ordinance directed that the land be divided into 40 lots with streets and alleys to accompany the courthouse and jail erected previously. By 1750, about 50 houses (including a few large two-story brick structures), a church (St. John's Anglican Parish), a courthouse, three stone warehouses, inns, taverns, stores, a public wharf and a \"gallows-tree\" with an \"Amen Corner\" with pillories and whipping posts (now located northeast of the City of Baltimore near present-day suburban \"Joppatowne\" off [[Harford Road]]) existed.\n\nA new port and wharfing site, [[Elkridge Landing]], on the upper [[Patapsco River]]'s Western Branch, became prosperous in the 18th Century. It was established on the \"falls\" of the river, below the rapids and rocks, where the river was deep enough for loaded sailing merchantmen. The landing was a designated \"port of entry\" and was the terminus of several \"rolling roads\" on which horse or oxen-drawn [[hogshead]]s (huge barrels) packed with tobacco were wheeled down to the Landing/port to be loaded on ships sailing for London and Europe. Gradually the site silted-up from soil erosion and poor farming cultivation on the upper Patapsco, and the maritime economy of the Landing faded. In the 19th Century, it became an important stop on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and the main north-south East Coast highway for wagons and carriages. Still, later it was on Washington Boulevard (designated [[United States Route 1|U.S. Route 1]]) by 1926.\n\nWith a bit of financial pressure, and after paying for the cost of a new courthouse (300 pounds sterling), dominant business, commercial and political residents of the Town of Baltimore were able to have the [[Maryland General Assembly]] relocate the county seat to their growing port town. In 1768, following receipt of petitions for and against the relocation, the General Assembly passed an Act that moved the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://aomol.msa.maryland.gov/000001/000061/html/am61p--86.html|title=Baltimore Town Made the County Seat|journal=Maryland State Archives (Archives of Maryland Online)|volume=61|pages=86\u201387|publisher=Maryland State Archives}}</ref> The first courthouse was constructed in 1768 at a new \"Courthouse Square\" (today on [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert Street]], between East Lexington and East Fayette Streets).\n\nThe Town of Baltimore, [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown]] and [[Fell's Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] were [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the ''[[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]]'' in 1796\u20131797. The city remained a part of surrounding Baltimore County and continued to serve as its [[county seat]] from 1768\u20131851.<ref name=\"Maryland Manual\">{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/html/bcity.html| title=Baltimore, Maryland\u2014Government| work=Maryland Manual On-Line: A Guide to Maryland Government| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=October 23, 2008| access-date=October 27, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919221820/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/html/bcity.html| archive-date= September 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe site of the courthouse is now \"[[Battle Monument|Battle Monument Square]]\", constructed 1815\u20131822 to commemorate the city and county defense in the [[War of 1812]], including the bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet in the [[Patapsco River]], the two-day stand-off in fortifications dug east of the city on Loudenschlager's Hill (now \"Hampstead Hill\" in today's [[Patterson Park]]) and the earlier [[Battle of North Point]] in \"Godly Woods\" on the \"Patapsco Neck\" peninsula in the southeastern portion of the county, during September 12\u201314, 1814. These events have been commemorated ever since by [[Defenders Day|Defenders' Day]], an annual city, county, and state official holiday on September 12.\n\nA second city-county courthouse constructed in 1805\u20131809 was moved to the western side of the Square at North Calvert and East Lexington. A third courthouse including the lower magistrates, commissioners, [[Government of Maryland#District Court|district]] and [[Maryland Circuit Courts|circuit courts]], orphans (inheritances/wills) court, small claims court and the old [[Courts of Maryland|Supreme Bench of Baltimore City]] was constructed on the entire western block of [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert]], East Lexington, East Fayette and [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|Saint Paul]] Streets from 1896 to 1900. In 1985 this building was renamed the [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. City Circuit Courthouse]], for the famous Baltimorean and leader of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Clarence M. Mitchell Jr.]] (1911\u20131984), reputed to be the \"101st U.S. Senator\".<ref name=\"BCHS\">[[Historical marker]], Towson Courthouse, Baltimore County Historical Society.</ref>\n\nIn 1816, the City of Baltimore annexed from Baltimore County several parcels of land known as the \"Precincts\" on its west, north, east and southwest sides.  The County separated from the City (which it surrounds on the east, north, and west) on July 4, 1851, as a result of the adoption of the 1851 second state constitution. Baltimore became one of the few \"[[Independent city (United States)|independent cities]]\" in the United States, putting it on the same level with the state's other 23 counties and granting limited \"[[home rule]]\" powers outside the authority of the Maryland General Assembly.\n\n[[Towson, Maryland|Towsontown]] was voted in a referendum by the voting citizens as the new \"county seat\" on February 13, 1854. The City of Baltimore continued annexing land from the county, extending its western and northern boundaries in 1888. The factory and business owners in the eastern industrial communities of [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] and [[Highlandtown, Baltimore|Highlandtown]] resisted and opposed annexation, but were annexed 30 years later. The last major annexation took place in 1918\u20131919, which again took territory from the County on all three sides (west, north, and east) as well as to the south for the first time from [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], along the south shores of the [[Patapsco River]].\n\nA new [[Baltimore County Courthouse]] was authorized to be built facing Washington Avenue, between Chesapeake and Pennsylvania Avenues to replace the previous courthouse and governmental offices then centered for near 85 years in the City, which had been the official \"county seat\" since just before the [[American Revolution]]. Later surrounded by manicured flower gardens, shrubs and curved walkways, the historical landmark is built of local [[limestone]] and [[marble]]. It was completed and dedicated in 1855. Wings and annexes were added in 1910, 1923 and 1958. By the 1970s, the County's legal system and governmental offices had grown so much that a separate modernistic \"County Courts Building\" was erected to the west behind the old Courthouse with its annexes, separated by a paved plaza which is used for employee/visitors relaxations and official ceremonies.\n\nA constitutional amendment to the 1867 Maryland Constitution was approved by referendum in 1948, prohibiting any future annexations without approval from residents in affected territories.\n\nExtensive city-county hostilities came during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and by the 1980s the county's older [[inner suburbs]] faced increasing urban social ills. An atmosphere of cooperation emerged with the drawing of cross-border state assembly districts, organizing of regional government agencies, and increasing state assumption of powers.\n\nThe County has a number of properties and sites of local, state and national historical interest on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Baltimore County, Maryland|\"National Register of Historic Places\"]] which is maintained by the [[National Park Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] by the \"Historic Sites Act\" of August 1935.\n\nSince 1854,[[Towson, Maryland|Towson]] has been the [[county seat]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties|accessdate=2011-06-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|archivedate=May 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Law and government==\nBaltimore County has had a charter government since 1956. The government consists of a [[Baltimore County Executive|County Executive]] and a seven-member [[County council|County Council]]. The County Executive and Council members are elected in years of gubernatorial elections. The County Executive may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.\n\nWithout incorporated cities or towns, the county government provides all local services to its residents, many of which are normally associated with city-type governmental agencies.\n\nIn 1956 the County adopted an \"executive-council\" system of government with \"at large\" representatives, replacing its traditional system of an elected Board of County Commissioners. Since then it has had eleven county executives and one \"acting\" executive, of which ten were [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and two were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. The former [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Spiro T. Agnew]], served as the third executive from 1962 to 1966 and subsequently was elected [[Governor of Maryland]], serving from 1967 to 1969. He was later accused of corruption and bribery while serving as County executive and continuing to accept bribes as the state's governor and as U.S. Vice President. He pleaded \"no contest\" to unprecedented Federal criminal charges. He was forced to resign the Vice Presidency in 1973.\n\nPolitically, Baltimore County leans [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], but not as overwhelmingly as Baltimore City. In general, the northern portions of the county lean Republican, while the southern portion is more Democratic.\n\n===State's attorney===\nThe [[Baltimore County State's Attorney]] is responsible for prosecuting the [[felony]], misdemeanor, and juvenile cases that occur in the county. As of 2017, the State's Attorney was Scott Shellenberger (Democrat). He followed Sandra A. O'Connor, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who served eight terms before retiring in 2006.\n\n===Law enforcement===\nThe [[Baltimore County Police Department]] is responsible for police services. The current head of the department is Chief Melissa Hyatt. <ref>https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/police/chiefsheridanbio.html</ref>\n\nEstablished in the mid-17th century, the Sheriff of Baltimore County was at first filled by county justices from 1662 to 1676. Thereafter the Court submitted three names from which the colonial governor chose a sheriff. Although terms of office initially varied, by 1692, a uniform two-year term was imposed. In 1699 a three-year term with separate commissions was adopted. The sheriff acted as the chief local representative of the Proprietary Government. His duties included the collection of all public taxes and after 1692, the collection of the yearly poll tax of forty pounds of tobacco for the support of the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] ([[Church of England]]) clergy and parishes. A sheriff received a percentage of collected monies, generally about five percent. He also received a yearly salary for duties such as reporting to the governor on affairs within the County, taking/estimating the census periodically, conveying official laws and proprietary requests to the county courts and selecting juries for court sessions. Along with enforcing all provincial laws, he posted new laws in public places. While his primary duty was to serve the Proprietor, the sheriff was aware of problems faced by poor planters and tradesmen. With taxes, yearly quit-rents and other costly expenditures, many of the poorer settlers were unable to pay their obligations when due. The sheriff often extended credit to these planters and paid their immediate obligations out of his own pocket. This lessened the impact of taxes for the poor, who repaid the sheriff after their harvests were brought in.\n\nThe modern [[Baltimore County Sheriff's Department]] is responsible for security of the two major [[Baltimore County Circuit Courthouse|County Circuit Courts]] buildings and various courtrooms elsewhere as well as process and warrant service. Sheriff's Deputies are sworn police officers and share the same powers of the more recently organized County Police Department. As of 2019, the Baltimore County Sheriff is [[Democratic Party United States|Democrat]], R. J. Fisher.\n\n===Fire Department===\nThe Baltimore County Fire Department (B.Co.F.D.)<ref>[http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/fire/index.html Baltimore County Md. Fire Department \u2013 Overview]. Baltimorecountymd.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.</ref> provides fire protection, emergency medical services and emergency rescue services to the county and surrounding areas, including Baltimore City, through mutual-aid pacts with those jurisdictions. The department consists of both paid and volunteer companies that provide services to overlapping territories. Twenty-five career (paid) stations and 28 volunteer stations operate there. More than 1,000 paid personnel and more than 2,000 volunteers serve in the department. The department conducts annual fire inspections on commercial properties, fire investigation and fire prevention education activities as well as water and tactical rescue. The current Chief is Joanne R. Rund who was sworn into the position on July 1 2019.<ref>[https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/News/BaltimoreCountyNow/olszewski-names-fire-chief-announces-other-key-leadership-roles]</ref>\n\n====Fire Department Support====\nCentral Alarmers (Station 155) was a private organization that provided fireground rehab support to firefighters (personal relief stations and refreshments) during large or prolonged incidents in the county's central and eastern regions. This organization merged with the White Marsh Volunteer Fire Company (Station 200) and continues to operate its services as a part of the White Marsh Volunteer Company. Box 234 Association (Station 156) also provides rehab support services to the western and southern regions of the county\n\n===County Executives===\nThe [[Baltimore County Executive]] oversees the executive branch of the County government, which is charged with implementing County law and overseeing the government operations. The current County Executive is [[John A. Olszewski Jr.]], a [[Democratic Party United States|Democrat]].\n\n===County Council===\nThe County Council adopts ordinances and resolutions and holds the County's legislative powers.\n\nAs of September, 2019, the Council has 4 [[Democratic Party United States|Democrats]] and 3 [[Republican Party United States|Republicans]].\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Baltimore County Council\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom;\"| District\n! align=center | Name\n! valign=bottom | Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:#33c;\"|&nbsp;\n| District 1\n| Tom Quirk\n| align=center | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#33c;\"|&nbsp;\n| District 2\n| Izzy Patoka\n| align=center | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n| bgcolor=red|&nbsp;\n| District 3\n| [[Wade Kach]]\n| align=center | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#33c;\"|&nbsp;\n| District 4\n| Julian E.

Rebecca Sharp (\"Becky\"), daughter of an art teacher and a French dancer, is a strong-willed, cunning, moneyless, young woman determined to make her way in society. After leaving school, Becky stays with Amelia Sedley (\"Emmy\"), who is a good-natured, simple-minded, young girl, of a wealthy London family. There, Becky meets the dashing and self-obsessed Captain George Osborne (Amelia's betrothed) and Amelia's brother Joseph (\"Jos\") Sedley, a clumsy and vainglorious but rich civil servant home from the [[East India Company]]. Hoping to marry Sedley, the richest young man she has met, Becky entices him, but she fails. George Osborne's friend Captain William Dobbin loves Amelia, but only wishes her happiness, which is centred on George.\n\nBecky Sharp says farewell to the Sedley family and enters the service of the crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, who has engaged her as a governess to his daughters. Her behaviour at Sir Pitt's house gains his favour, and after the premature death of his second wife, he proposes marriage to her. However, he finds that she has secretly married his second son, Captain Rawdon Crawley, but Becky very much regrets having done this as she had no idea that his father's wife would die so soon after. Sir Pitt's elder half sister, the spinster Miss Crawley, is very rich, having inherited her mother's fortune, and the whole Crawley family compete for her favour so she will bequeath them her wealth. Initially her favourite is Rawdon Crawley, but his marriage with Becky enrages her. First she favours the family of Sir Pitt's brother, but when she dies, she has left her money to Sir Pitt's oldest son, also called Pitt.\n\n[[File:Map of the battle of waterloo by W.B.

George's rich father forbids George to marry Amelia, who is now poor. Dobbin persuades George to marry Amelia, and George is consequently disinherited. George Osborne, William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley are deployed to Brussels, accompanied by Amelia and Becky, and Amelia's brother, Jos. George is embarrassed by the vulgarity of Mrs. Major O'Dowd, the wife of the head of the regiment. Already, the newly wedded Osborne is growing tired of Amelia, and he becomes increasingly attracted to Becky, which makes Amelia jealous and unhappy. He is also losing money to Rawdon at cards and billiards. At a ball in Brussels, George gives Becky a note inviting her to run away with him. But then the army have marching orders to the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and George spends a tender night with Amelia and leaves. The noise of battle horrifies Amelia, and she is comforted by the brisk but kind Mrs. O'Dowd. Becky is indifferent and makes plans for whatever the outcome (if Napoleon wins, she would aim to become the mistress of one of his Marshals...). She also makes a profit selling her carriage and horses at inflated prices to Jos, who is seeking to flee Brussels.\n\nGeorge Osborne is killed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], while Dobbin and Rawdon survive the battle. Amelia bears him a posthumous son, who carries on the name George. She returns to live in genteel poverty with her parents, spending her life in memory of her husband and care of her son. Dobbin pays for a small annuity for Amelia and expresses his love for her by small kindnesses toward her and her son. She is too much in love with her husband's memory to return Dobbin's love. Saddened, he goes with his regiment to India for many years.\n\nBecky also has a son, named Rawdon after his father. Becky is a cold, distant mother, although Rawdon loves his son. Becky continues her ascent first in post-war Paris and then in London where she is patronised by the rich and powerful Marquis of Steyne. She is eventually presented at court to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and charms him further at a game of \"[[acting charades]]\" where she plays the roles of [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Philomela]]. The elderly Sir Pitt Crawley dies and is succeeded by his son Pitt, who had married Lady Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdown's third daughter. Becky is on good terms with Pitt and Jane originally, but Jane is disgusted by Becky's attitude to her son and jealous of Becky's relationship with Pitt.\n\nAt the summit of their social success, Rawdon is arrested for debt, possibly at Becky's connivance.<ref name=suthvf/> The financial success of the Crawleys had been a topic of gossip; in fact they were living on credit even when it ruined those who trusted them, such as their landlord, an old servant of the Crawley family. The Marquis of Steyne had given Becky money, jewels, and other gifts but Becky does not use them for expenses or to free her husband. Instead, Rawdon's letter to his brother is received by Lady Jane, who pays the \u00a3170 that prompted his imprisonment. He returns home to find Becky singing to Steyne and strikes him down on the assumption\u2014despite her protestations of innocence\u2014that they are having an affair. Steyne is indignant, having assumed the \u00a31000 he had just given Becky was part of an arrangement with her husband. Rawdon finds Becky's hidden bank records and leaves her, expecting Steyne to challenge him to a duel. Instead Steyne arranges for Rawdon to be made Governor of Coventry Island, a pest-ridden location. Becky, having lost both husband and credibility, leaves England and wanders the continent, leaving her son in the care of Pitt and Lady Jane.\n\n[[File:Vanity Fair D722.png|thumb|right|200px|Two girls close up their box of dolls at the end of the story.]]\nAs Amelia's adored son George grows up, his grandfather Mr Osborne relents towards him (though not towards Amelia) and takes him from his impoverished mother, who knows the rich old man will give him a better start in life than she could manage. After twelve years abroad, both Joseph Sedley and Dobbin return. Dobbin professes his unchanged love to Amelia. Amelia is affectionate, but she cannot forget the memory of her dead husband. Dobbin mediates a reconciliation between Amelia and her father-in-law, who dies soon after. He had amended his will, bequeathing young George half his large fortune and Amelia a generous annuity.\n\nAfter the death of Mr Osborne, Amelia, Jos, George and Dobbin go to Pumpernickel ([[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Weimar]] in [[North German Confederation|Germany]]),<ref name=suthvf>{{harvp|Sutherland|1988|loc=\"[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=X2KuBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA656 Vanity Fair]\"}}.</ref> where they encounter the destitute Becky. Becky has fallen in life. She lives among card sharps and con artists, drinking heavily and gambling. Becky enchants Jos Sedley all over again, and Amelia is persuaded to let Becky join them. Dobbin forbids this, and reminds Amelia of her jealousy of Becky with her husband. Amelia feels that this dishonours the memory of her dead and revered husband, and this leads to a complete breach between her and Dobbin. Dobbin leaves the group and rejoins his regiment, while Becky remains with the group.\n\nHowever, Becky has decided that Amelia should marry Dobbin, even though she knows Dobbin is her enemy. Becky shows Amelia George's note, kept all this time from the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, and Amelia finally realises that George was not the perfect man she always thought, and that she has rejected a better man, Dobbin. Amelia and Dobbin are reconciled and return to England. Becky and Jos stay in Europe. Jos dies, possibly suspiciously, after signing a portion of his money to Becky as life insurance, setting her up with an income. She returns to England, and manages a respectable life, although all her previous friends refuse to acknowledge her.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Vanity Fair D041.png|right|200px|thumb|Becky and Emmy as girls, from one of Thackeray's illustrations at the beginning of the book.<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |year=1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n39/mode/2up 15] }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Vanity Fair D723.png|right|200px|thumb|''Virtue rewarded; A booth in Vanity Fair''.

Not very beautiful, she is frequently ignored by men and women but is well-liked by most men who get to know her because of her personality. This popularity is then resented by other women. She begins the work as its heroine (\"selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured of all\")<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n33/mode/2up 9] |year=1848 }}.</ref> and marries the dashing George Osborne against his father's wishes, but the narrator is soon forced to admit \"she wasn't a heroine\" after all<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n137/mode/2up 103] |year=1848 }}.</ref> as she remains soppily devoted to him despite his neglect of her and his flirtation with Becky. After George dies in the [[Battle of Waterloo]], she brings up little George alone while living with her parents. She is completely dominated by her increasingly peevish mother and her spendthrift father, who, to finance one of his failing investment schemes, sells the annuity Jos had provided. Amelia becomes obsessed with her son and the memory of her husband. She ignores William Dobbin, who courts her for years and treats him shabbily until he leaves. Only when Becky shows her George's letter to her is Amelia able to move on, though she informs Becky that she has already written to Dobbin to ask him to come back. She eventually marries Dobbin.\n\nIn a letter to his close friend [[Jane Octavia Brookfield]] while the book was being written, Thackeray confided that \"You know you are only a piece of Amelia, my mother is another half, my poor little wife ''y est pour beaucoup''\".<ref name=house/>{{efn|French: \"...is the rest.\"}}{{sfnp|Taylor|2004}} Within the work, her character is compared and connected to [[Iphigenia]],{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=16 ff}} although two of the references extend the allusion to all daughters in all drawing rooms as potential Iphigenias waiting to be sacrificed by their families.{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=20\u20131}} Her sacrifice of her child to her wealthy relatives is compared to the [[Tenakh|biblical]] [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]].\n\n=== Becky Sharp (Rebecca) ===\n{{main article|Becky Sharp}}\n[[Becky Sharp (character)|Rebecca Sharp]], called Becky, is Amelia's opposite, an intelligent young woman with a gift for satire. She is described as a short sandy haired girl who has green eyes and a great deal of wit. Becky is born to a French opera dancer mother and an art teacher and artist father Francis. Fluent in both French and English, Becky has a beautiful singing voice, plays the piano, and shows great talent as an actress. Without a mother to guide her into marriage, Becky resolves that \"I must be my own Mamma\".{{sfnp|York|1997|p=22}} She thereafter appears to be completely amoral and without conscience and has been called the work's \"[[anti-heroine]]\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/nov/17/readers-anti-hero-anti-heroines-fiction \"Readers love a good anti-hero \u2013 so why do they shun anti-heroines?\"] by [[Emma Jane Unsworth]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 November 2014</ref> She does not seem to have the ability to get attached to other people, and lies easily and intelligently to get her way. She is extremely manipulative and, after the first few chapters and her failure to attract Jos Sedley, is not shown as being particularly sincere. Never having known financial or social security even as a child, Becky desires it above all things. Nearly everything she does is with the intention of securing a stable position for herself, or herself and her husband after she and Rawdon are married. She advances Rawdon's interests tirelessly, flirting with men such as General Tufto and the Marquis of Steyne to get him promoted. She also uses her feminine wiles to distract men at card parties while Rawdon cheats them blind. Marrying Rawdon Crawley in secret was a mistake, as was running off instead of begging Miss Crawley's forgiveness. She also fails to manipulate Miss Crawley through Rawdon so as to obtain an inheritance. Although Becky manipulates men very easily, she is less successful with women. She is utterly hostile to Lady Bareacres<ref>{{harvp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110 110\u2013111]}}.</ref>, dismissive of Mrs. O'Dowd, and Lady Jane, although initially friendly, eventually distrusts and dislikes her. The exceptions to this trend are (at least initially) Miss Crawley, her companion Miss Briggs, and her school friend Amelia; the latter is the recipient of more-or-less the only kindnesses Becky expresses in the work, persuading her to marry Dobbin in light of what Becky comes to appreciate to be his good qualities and protecting Amelia from two ruffians vying for her attentions. This comparative loyalty to Amelia stems from Becky having no other friends at school, and Amelia having \"by a thousand kind words and offices, overcome... (Becky's) hostility\"; 'The gentle tender-hearted Amelia Sedley was the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least; and who could help attaching herself to Amelia?' Beginning with her determination to be her \"own Mamma\", Becky begins to assume the role of [[Clytemnestra]].{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=22 ff}} Becky and her necklace from Steyne also allude to the fallen [[Eriphyle]] in [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s [[Iphig\u00e9nie|retelling]] of ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'', where she [[Foil (literature)|doubles]] and rescues Iphigenia.{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=30 ff}} In lesser contexts, Becky also appears as [[Arachne]] to Miss Pinkerton's [[Minerva]]{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=24 ff}} and as a variety of classical figures in the works' illustrations.\n\n=== Rawdon Crawley ===\nRawdon, the younger of the two Crawley sons, is an empty-headed cavalry officer who is his wealthy aunt's favourite until he marries Becky Sharp, who is of a far lower class. He permanently alienates his aunt, who leaves her estate to Rawdon's elder brother Sir Pitt instead. Sir Pitt has by this time inherited their father's estate, leaving Rawdon destitute.\n\nThe well-meaning Rawdon does have a few talents in life, most of them having to do with gambling and duelling. He is very good at cards and billiards, and although he does not always win he is able to earn cash by betting against less talented gamblers. He is heavily indebted throughout most of the book, not so much for his own expenses as for Becky's. Not particularly talented as a military officer, he is content to let Becky manage his career.\n\nAlthough Rawdon knows Becky is attractive to men, he believes her reputation is spotless even though she is widely suspected of romantic intrigue with General Tufto and other powerful men. Nobody dares to suggest otherwise to Rawdon because of his temper and his reputation for duelling. Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.\n\nAfter Rawdon finds out the truth and leaves Becky for an assignment overseas, he leaves his son to be brought up by his brother Sir Pitt and his wife Lady Jane. While overseas, Rawdon dies of yellow fever.\n\n=== Pitt Crawley ===\nRawdon Crawley's elder brother inherits the Crawley estate from his father, the boorish and vulgar Sir Pitt, and also inherits the estate of his wealthy aunt, Miss Crawley, after she disinherits Rawdon. Pitt is very religious and has political aspirations, although not many people appreciate his intelligence or wisdom because there's not much there to appreciate. Somewhat pedantic and conservative, Pitt does nothing to help Rawdon or Becky even when they fall on hard times. This is chiefly due to the influence of his wife, Lady Jane, who dislikes Becky because of her callous treatment of her son, and also because Becky repaid Lady Jane's earlier kindness by patronising her and flirting with Sir Pitt.\n\n=== Miss Matilda Crawley ===\nThe elderly Miss Crawley is everyone's favourite wealthy aunt. Sir Pitt and Rawdon both dote on her, although Rawdon is her favourite nephew and sole heir until he marries Becky. While Miss Crawley likes Becky and keeps her around to entertain her with sarcasm and wit, and while she loves scandal and particularly stories of unwise marriage, she does not want scandal or unwise marriage in her family. A substantial part of the early section of the book deals with the efforts the Crawleys make to kowtow to Miss Crawley in the hope of receiving a big inheritance.\n\nHer portrayal is informed by Thackeray's time in Paris with his maternal grandmother Harriet Becher.<ref>{{citation |last=Shillingsburg |first=Peter |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography }}.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== George Osborne ===\nGeorge Osborne, his father (a merchant, of considerably superior social status to Dobbin's grocer father, albeit self made, and ironically a mere corporal in the City Light Horse regiment of which Dobbin senior, by this time an alderman and a knight, is colonel), and his two sisters are close to the Sedley family until Mr. Sedley (the father of Jos and Amelia, and George Osborne's godfather, from whom the latter takes his middle name of 'Sedley') goes bankrupt following some ill-advised speculation. Since George and Amelia were raised in close company and were childhood sweethearts, George defies his father to marry Amelia. Before father and son can be reconciled, George is killed at the battle of Waterloo, leaving the pregnant Amelia to carry on as well as she can.\n\nRaised to be a selfish, vain, profligate spender, handsome and self-obsessed, George squanders the last of the money he receives from his father and sets nothing aside to help support Amelia. After marrying Amelia, he finds after a couple of weeks that he is bored. He flirts with Becky quite seriously and is reconciled to Amelia only a short time before he is killed in battle.\n\n=== William Dobbin ===\nThe best friend of George Osborne, Captain William Dobbin is tall, ungainly, and not particularly handsome. He is a few years older than George but has been friends with him since his schooldays, even though Dobbin's father is a fig-merchant (Dobbin & Rudge, grocers and oilmen, Thames Street, London - he is later an alderman and colonel of the City Light Horse regiment, and knighted) and the Osbornes belong to the genteel class and have become independently wealthy. He defends George and is blind to his faults in many ways, although he tries to force George to do the right thing. He pushes George to keep his promise to marry Amelia even though Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself. After George is killed, Dobbin puts together an annuity to help support Amelia, ostensibly with the help of George's fellow officers.\n\nLater, Major and Lieutenant Colonel Dobbin discreetly does what he can to help support Amelia and her son George. He allows Amelia to continue with her obsession over George and does not correct her erroneous beliefs about him. He hangs about for years, either pining away over her while serving in India or waiting on her in person, allowing her to take advantage of his good nature. After Amelia finally chooses Becky's friendship over his during their stay in Germany, Dobbin leaves in disgust. He returns when Amelia writes to him and admits her feelings for him, marries her (despite having lost much of his passion for her), and has a daughter whom he loves deeply.\n\n=== Joseph Sedley ===\nAmelia's older brother, Joseph \"Jos\" Sedley, is a \"[[nabob]]\", who made a respectable fortune as a [[District collector|collector]] in India. Obese and self-important but very shy and insecure, he is attracted to Becky Sharp but circumstances prevent him from proposing. He never marries, but when he meets Becky again he is easily manipulated into falling in love with her. Jos is not a courageous or intelligent man, displaying his cowardice at the Battle of Waterloo by trying to flee and purchasing both of Becky's overpriced horses. Becky ensnares him again near the end of the book and, it is hinted, murders him for his life insurance.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Vanity Fair Prospectus.png|Right|200px|thumb|The 1847 [[prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for the ''Vanity Fair: Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society'' serial, advertising it under [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s pen name Michael Angelo Titmarsh and under his own name.]]\n[[File:Houghton EC85 T3255 848vb - Vanity Fair, title.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The title page of the 1848 first edition of ''Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero''.]]\n[[File:Vanity Fair D720.png|thumb|right|200px|''Becky's second appearance in the character of [[Clytemnestra]]'', an illustration and caption by Thackeray that makes it clear he considered her to have killed Jos for his insurance money.<ref name=bigmac/>]]\nThackeray may have begun working out some of the details of ''Vanity Fair'' as early as 1841 but probably began writing it in late 1844.{{refn|Tillotson & al.,{{sfnp|Tillotson & al.|1963|pp=xvii ff.}} cited in York.{{sfnp|York|1997|p=29}}}} Like many novels of the time, ''Vanity Fair'' was published as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] before being sold in book form.

Woodcut engravings, which could be set along with normal moveable type, appeared within the text. The same engraved illustration appeared on the canary-yellow cover of each monthly part; this colour became Thackeray's signature, as a light blue-green was Dickens's, allowing passers-by to notice a new Thackeray number in a bookstall from a distance. ''Vanity Fair'' was the first work that Thackeray published under his own name and was extremely well received at the time. After the conclusion of its serial publication, it was printed as a bound volume by Bradbury & Evans in 1848 and was quickly picked up by other London printers as well. As a collected work, the novels bore the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero''.{{efn|In addition to its other intentions, the name was a jab at [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s \"Lectures on Hero and Hero-Worship\".{{sfnp|Sutherland|1988|loc=\"Carlyle & Carlylism\"}}}} By the end of 1859, [[royalties]] on ''Vanity Fair'' had only given Thackeray about [[GBP|\u00a3]]2000, a third of his take from ''[[The Virginians]]'', but was responsible for his still more lucrative lecture tours in Britain and the United States.<ref name=castaway>{{harvp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA13 13]}}.</ref>{{efn|In the letter where he recorded these sums, Thackeray noted \"Three more years please the [[Fates]] and the girls will have eight or ten thousand a-piece that I want for them: we must n't<!--sic--> say a word against filthy lucre for I see the use and comfort of it every day more and more.

In Chapter 5, an original \"Prince Whadyecallem\"<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n63/mode/2up 36]}}.</ref> became \"Prince Ahmed\" by the 1853 edition.{{sfnp|York|1997|p=28}} In Chapter 13, a passage about the filicidal [[Bible|Biblical]] figure [[Jephthah]] was removed, although references to [[Iphigenia]] remained important.{{sfnp|York|1997|p=28}} In Chapter 56, Thackeray originally confused [[Samuel]] \u2013 the boy whose mother [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] had given him up when called to by [[Jewish God|God]] \u2013 with [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]],<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n591/mode/2up 504] }}.</ref> the old priest to whose care he was entrusted; this mistake was not corrected until the 1889 edition,{{sfnp|York|1997|p=133}} after Thackeray's death.\n\nThe serials had been subtitled ''Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society'' and both they and the early bound versions featured Thackeray's own illustrations. These sometimes provided symbolically-freighted images, such as one of the female characters being portrayed as a man-eating [[mermaid]]. In at least one case, a major plot point is provided through an image and its caption. Although the text makes it clear that other characters suspect Becky Sharp to have murdered her second husband, there is nothing definitive in the text itself. However, an image reveals her overhearing Jos pleading with Dobbin while clutching a small white object in her hand. The caption that this is ''Becky's second appearance in the character of [[Clytemnestra]]'' clarifies that she did indeed murder him for the insurance money,<ref name=highwater/> likely through [[laudanum]] or another poison.{{sfnp|Dibattista|1980}}<ref name=bigmac>{{citation |contribution=W.M.

A letter to his editor at ''[[Punch, or the London Charivari|Punch]]'' expressed his belief that \"our profession... is as serious as the [[parson]]'s own\".<ref name=poohcorner>{{harvp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA108 108]}}.</ref> He considered it his own coming-of-age as a writer{{efn|To a German visitor who told him he had learned to read English from ''Vanity Fair'', Thackeray replied \"And that's where I learned to write it\".{{sfnp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA85 85]}}}} and greatest work.<ref name=house>{{harvp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA86 86]}}.</ref>\n\nCritics hailed the work as a literary treasure before the last part of the serial was published. In her correspondence, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] was effusive regarding his illustrations as well: \"You will not easily find a second Thackeray. How he can render, with a few black lines and dots, shades of expression, so fine, so real; traits of character so minute, so subtle, so difficult to seize and fix, I cannot tell\u2014I can only wonder and admire... If Truth were again a goddess, Thackeray should be her high priest.\"{{sfnp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA8 8]}} The early reviewers took the debt to Bunyan as self-evident and compared Becky with Pilgrim and Thackeray with Faithful.<ref name=poohcorner/> Although they were superlative in their praise,<ref>See, e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' review of 10 July 1848.</ref> some expressed disappointment at the unremittingly dark portrayal of human nature, fearing Thackeray had taken his dismal metaphor too far. In response to these critics, Thackeray explained that he saw people for the most part as \"abominably foolish and selfish\".{{sfnp|Ray|1946|p=309}} The unhappy ending was intended to inspire readers to look inward at their own shortcomings. Other critics took notice of or exception to the social subversion in the work; in his correspondence, Thackeray stated his criticism was not reserved to the upper class: \"My object is to make every body engaged, engaged in the pursuit of Vanity Fair and I must carry my story through in this dreary minor key, with only occasional hints here and there of better things\u2014of better things which it does not become me to preach\".<ref name=thisonegoestoeleven>{{harvp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA111 111]}}.</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\n{{Original research section|date=August 2015}}\nThe novel is considered a classic of English literature, though some critics claim that it has structural problems; Thackeray sometimes lost track of the huge scope of his work, mixing up characters' names and minor plot details. The number of allusions and references it contains can make it difficult for modern readers to follow.\n\nThe subtitle, ''A Novel without a Hero'', is apt because the characters are all flawed to a greater or lesser degree; even the most sympathetic have weaknesses, for example Captain Dobbin, who is prone to [[vanity]] and [[melancholia|melancholy]]. The human weaknesses Thackeray illustrates are mostly to do with [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]], [[laziness|idleness]], and [[snob]]bery, and the scheming, [[lie|deceit]] and [[hypocrisy]] which mask them. None of the characters are wholly evil, although Becky's manipulative, amoral tendencies make her come pretty close. However, even Becky, who is amoral and cunning, is thrown on her own resources by poverty and its stigma. (She is the orphaned daughter of a poor artist and an opera dancer.) Thackeray's tendency to highlight faults in all of his characters displays his desire for a greater level of [[Literary realism|realism]] in his fiction compared to the rather unlikely or idealised people in many contemporary novels.\n\nThe novel is a satire of society as a whole, characterised by hypocrisy and [[opportunism]], but it is not a reforming novel; there is no suggestion that social or political changes or greater piety and [[Victorian morality|moral reformism]] could improve the nature of society. It thus paints a fairly bleak view of the human condition. This bleak portrait is continued with Thackeray's own role as an [[omniscient narrator]], one of the writers best known for using the technique. He continually offers asides about his characters and compares them to actors and puppets, but his cheek goes even as far as his readers, accusing all who may be interested in such \"Vanity Fairs\" as being either \"of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood\".<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n15/mode/2up viii] |year=1848 }}.</ref> As [[Lord David Cecil]] remarked, \"Thackeray liked people, and for the most part he thought them well-intentioned. But he also saw very clearly that they were all in some degree weak and vain, self-absorbed and self-deceived.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Cecil |first=David |author-link=Lord David Cecil |title=Early Victorian Novelists |publisher=Constable |year=1934 |page=69}}.</ref> Amelia begins as a warm-hearted and friendly girl, though sentimental and naive, but by the story's end she is portrayed as vacuous and shallow. Dobbin appears first as loyal and magnanimous, if unaware of his own worth; by the end of the story he is presented as a tragic fool, a prisoner of his own sense of duty who knows he is wasting his gifts on Amelia but is unable to live without her. The novel's increasingly grim outlook can take readers aback, as characters whom the reader at first holds in sympathy are shown to be unworthy of such regard.\n\nThe work is often compared to the other great historical novel of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.{{efn|Examples include Carey's ''Prodigal Genius''<ref>{{cite book |last=Carey |first=John |author-link=John Carey (critic) |title=Thackeray: Prodigal Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/thackerayprodiga0000care |url-access=registration |publisher=Faber |year=1977}}</ref> and McAloon's defence of the work in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''.<ref>{{citation |last=McAloon |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/why-vanity-fair-is-the-greatest-novel-about-waterloo/ |title=Why ''Vanity Fair'' Is the Greatest Novel about Waterloo |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=20 June 2015 }}.</ref>}} While Tolstoy's work has a greater emphasis on the historical detail and the effect the war has upon his protagonists, Thackeray instead uses the conflict as a backdrop to the lives of his characters. The momentous events on the continent do not always have an equally important influence on the behaviours of Thackeray's characters. Rather their faults tend to compound over time. This is in contrast to the redemptive power the conflict has on the characters in ''War and Peace''. For Thackeray, the Napoleonic wars as a whole can be thought of as one more of the vanities expressed in the title.\n\nA common critical topic is to address various objects in the book and the characters' relationships with them, such as Rebecca's diamonds or the piano Amelia values when she thinks it came from George and dismisses upon learning that Dobbin provided it. [[Marxist criticism|Marxist]] and similar schools of criticism that go further and see Thackeray condemning [[consumerism]] and capitalism, however, largely overstate their case.{{sfnp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 114]}} Thackeray is pointed in his criticism of the commodification of women in the marriage market, but his variations on [[Ecclesiastes]]'s \"[[all is vanity]]\"<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |pp=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n529/mode/2up 450] & [https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n721/mode/2up 624]}}.</ref> are more personal than institutional.

It was first published as a 19-volume monthly [[serial novel|serial]] from 1847 to 1848, carrying the subtitle '''''Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society''''', reflecting both its [[satire|satirisation]] of early 19th-century British society and the many illustrations drawn by Thackeray to accompany the text. It was published as a single volume in 1848 with the subtitle '''''A Novel without a Hero''''', reflecting Thackeray's interest in [[Deconstruction (literature)|deconstructing]] his era's conventions regarding [[Hero#The modern fictional hero|literary heroism]].<ref name=malvinas>{{citation |last=Faulks |first=Sebastian |authorlink=Sebastian Faulks |title=Faulks on Fiction: Great British Heroes and the Secret Life of the Novel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SUnJZ2sNrAEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Faulks+on+fiction#v=onepage&q=Vanity&f=false  |p=14 |year=2011 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=9781846079597 }}.</ref> It is sometimes considered the \"principal founder\" of the Victorian domestic novel.{{sfnp|Sutherland|1988|loc=\"Domestic Fiction\"}}\n\nThe story is [[frame story|framed]] as a [[puppet play]], and the narrator, despite being an [[authorial voice]], is somewhat [[unreliable narrator|unreliable]].

Rebecca Sharp (\"Becky\"), daughter of an art teacher and a French dancer, is a strong-willed, cunning, moneyless, young woman determined to make her way in society. After leaving school, Becky stays with Amelia Sedley (\"Emmy\"), who is a good-natured, simple-minded, young girl, of a wealthy London family. There, Becky meets the dashing and self-obsessed Captain George Osborne (Amelia's betrothed) and Amelia's brother Joseph (\"Jos\") Sedley, a clumsy and vainglorious but rich civil servant home from the [[East India Company]]. Hoping to marry Sedley, the richest young man she has met, Becky entices him, but she fails. George Osborne's friend Captain William Dobbin loves Amelia, but only wishes her happiness, which is centred on George.\n\nBecky Sharp says farewell to the Sedley family and enters the service of the crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, who has engaged her as a governess to his daughters. Her behaviour at Sir Pitt's house gains his favour, and after the premature death of his second wife, he proposes marriage to her. However, he finds that she has secretly married his second son, Captain Rawdon Crawley, but Becky very much regrets having done this as she had no idea that his father's wife would die so soon after. Sir Pitt's elder half sister, the spinster Miss Crawley, is very rich, having inherited her mother's fortune, and the whole Crawley family compete for her favour so she will bequeath them her wealth. Initially her favourite is Rawdon Crawley, but his marriage with Becky enrages her. First she favours the family of Sir Pitt's brother, but when she dies, she has left her money to Sir Pitt's oldest son, also called Pitt.\n\n[[File:Map of the battle of waterloo by W.B.

George's rich father forbids George to marry Amelia, who is now poor. Dobbin persuades George to marry Amelia, and George is consequently disinherited. George Osborne, William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley are deployed to Brussels, accompanied by Amelia and Becky, and Amelia's brother, Jos. George is embarrassed by the vulgarity of Mrs. Major O'Dowd, the wife of the head of the regiment. Already, the newly wedded Osborne is growing tired of Amelia, and he becomes increasingly attracted to Becky, which makes Amelia jealous and unhappy. He is also losing money to Rawdon at cards and billiards. At a ball in Brussels, George gives Becky a note inviting her to run away with him. But then the army have marching orders to the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and George spends a tender night with Amelia and leaves. The noise of battle horrifies Amelia, and she is comforted by the brisk but kind Mrs. O'Dowd. Becky is indifferent and makes plans for whatever the outcome (if Napoleon wins, she would aim to become the mistress of one of his Marshals...). She also makes a profit selling her carriage and horses at inflated prices to Jos, who is seeking to flee Brussels.\n\nGeorge Osborne is killed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], while Dobbin and Rawdon survive the battle. Amelia bears him a posthumous son, who carries on the name George. She returns to live in genteel poverty with her parents, spending her life in memory of her husband and care of her son. Dobbin pays for a small annuity for Amelia and expresses his love for her by small kindnesses toward her and her son. She is too much in love with her husband's memory to return Dobbin's love. Saddened, he goes with his regiment to India for many years.\n\nBecky also has a son, named Rawdon after his father. Becky is a cold, distant mother, although Rawdon loves his son. Becky continues her ascent first in post-war Paris and then in London where she is patronised by the rich and powerful Marquis of Steyne. She is eventually presented at court to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and charms him further at a game of \"[[acting charades]]\" where she plays the roles of [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Philomela]]. The elderly Sir Pitt Crawley dies and is succeeded by his son Pitt, who had married Lady Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdown's third daughter. Becky is on good terms with Pitt and Jane originally, but Jane is disgusted by Becky's attitude to her son and jealous of Becky's relationship with Pitt.\n\nAt the summit of their social success, Rawdon is arrested for debt, possibly at Becky's connivance.<ref name=suthvf/> The financial success of the Crawleys had been a topic of gossip; in fact they were living on credit even when it ruined those who trusted them, such as their landlord, an old servant of the Crawley family. The Marquis of Steyne had given Becky money, jewels, and other gifts but Becky does not use them for expenses or to free her husband. Instead, Rawdon's letter to his brother is received by Lady Jane, who pays the \u00a3170 that prompted his imprisonment. He returns home to find Becky singing to Steyne and strikes him down on the assumption\u2014despite her protestations of innocence\u2014that they are having an affair. Steyne is indignant, having assumed the \u00a31000 he had just given Becky was part of an arrangement with her husband. Rawdon finds Becky's hidden bank records and leaves her, expecting Steyne to challenge him to a duel. Instead Steyne arranges for Rawdon to be made Governor of Coventry Island, a pest-ridden location. Becky, having lost both husband and credibility, leaves England and wanders the continent, leaving her son in the care of Pitt and Lady Jane.\n\n[[File:Vanity Fair D722.png|thumb|right|200px|Two girls close up their box of dolls at the end of the story.]]\nAs Amelia's adored son George grows up, his grandfather Mr Osborne relents towards him (though not towards Amelia) and takes him from his impoverished mother, who knows the rich old man will give him a better start in life than she could manage. After twelve years abroad, both Joseph Sedley and Dobbin return. Dobbin professes his unchanged love to Amelia. Amelia is affectionate, but she cannot forget the memory of her dead husband. Dobbin mediates a reconciliation between Amelia and her father-in-law, who dies soon after. He had amended his will, bequeathing young George half his large fortune and Amelia a generous annuity.\n\nAfter the death of Mr Osborne, Amelia, Jos, George and Dobbin go to Pumpernickel ([[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Weimar]] in [[North German Confederation|Germany]]),<ref name=suthvf>{{harvp|Sutherland|1988|loc=\"[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=X2KuBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA656 Vanity Fair]\"}}.</ref> where they encounter the destitute Becky. Becky has fallen in life. She lives among card sharps and con artists, drinking heavily and gambling. Becky enchants Jos Sedley all over again, and Amelia is persuaded to let Becky join them. Dobbin forbids this, and reminds Amelia of her jealousy of Becky with her husband. Amelia feels that this dishonours the memory of her dead and revered husband, and this leads to a complete breach between her and Dobbin. Dobbin leaves the group and rejoins his regiment, while Becky remains with the group.\n\nHowever, Becky has decided that Amelia should marry Dobbin, even though she knows Dobbin is her enemy. Becky shows Amelia George's note, kept all this time from the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, and Amelia finally realises that George was not the perfect man she always thought, and that she has rejected a better man, Dobbin. Amelia and Dobbin are reconciled and return to England. Becky and Jos stay in Europe. Jos dies, possibly suspiciously, after signing a portion of his money to Becky as life insurance, setting her up with an income. She returns to England, and manages a respectable life, although all her previous friends refuse to acknowledge her.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Vanity Fair D041.png|right|200px|thumb|Becky and Emmy as girls, from one of Thackeray's illustrations at the beginning of the book.<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |year=1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n39/mode/2up 15] }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Vanity Fair D723.png|right|200px|thumb|''Virtue rewarded; A booth in Vanity Fair''.

Not very beautiful, she is frequently ignored by men and women but is well-liked by most men who get to know her because of her personality. This popularity is then resented by other women. She begins the work as its heroine (\"selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured of all\")<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n33/mode/2up 9] |year=1848 }}.</ref> and marries the dashing George Osborne against his father's wishes, but the narrator is soon forced to admit \"she wasn't a heroine\" after all<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n137/mode/2up 103] |year=1848 }}.</ref> as she remains soppily devoted to him despite his neglect of her and his flirtation with Becky. After George dies in the [[Battle of Waterloo]], she brings up little George alone while living with her parents. She is completely dominated by her increasingly peevish mother and her spendthrift father, who, to finance one of his failing investment schemes, sells the annuity Jos had provided. Amelia becomes obsessed with her son and the memory of her husband. She ignores William Dobbin, who courts her for years and treats him shabbily until he leaves. Only when Becky shows her George's letter to her is Amelia able to move on, though she informs Becky that she has already written to Dobbin to ask him to come back. She eventually marries Dobbin.\n\nIn a letter to his close friend [[Jane Octavia Brookfield]] while the book was being written, Thackeray confided that \"You know you are only a piece of Amelia, my mother is another half, my poor little wife ''y est pour beaucoup''\".<ref name=house/>{{efn|French: \"...is the rest.\"}}{{sfnp|Taylor|2004}} Within the work, her character is compared and connected to [[Iphigenia]],{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=16 ff}} although two of the references extend the allusion to all daughters in all drawing rooms as potential Iphigenias waiting to be sacrificed by their families.{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=20\u20131}} Her sacrifice of her child to her wealthy relatives is compared to the [[Tenakh|biblical]] [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]].\n\n=== Becky Sharp (Rebecca) ===\n{{main article|Becky Sharp}}\n[[Becky Sharp (character)|Rebecca Sharp]], called Becky, is Amelia's opposite, an intelligent young woman with a gift for satire. She is described as a short sandy haired girl who has green eyes and a great deal of wit. Becky is born to a French opera dancer mother and an art teacher and artist father Francis. Fluent in both French and English, Becky has a beautiful singing voice, plays the piano, and shows great talent as an actress. Without a mother to guide her into marriage, Becky resolves that \"I must be my own Mamma\".{{sfnp|York|1997|p=22}} She thereafter appears to be completely amoral and without conscience and has been called the work's \"[[anti-heroine]]\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/nov/17/readers-anti-hero-anti-heroines-fiction \"Readers love a good anti-hero \u2013 so why do they shun anti-heroines?\"] by [[Emma Jane Unsworth]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 November 2014</ref> She does not seem to have the ability to get attached to other people, and lies easily and intelligently to get her way. She is extremely manipulative and, after the first few chapters and her failure to attract Jos Sedley, is not shown as being particularly sincere. Never having known financial or social security even as a child, Becky desires it above all things. Nearly everything she does is with the intention of securing a stable position for herself, or herself and her husband after she and Rawdon are married. She advances Rawdon's interests tirelessly, flirting with men such as General Tufto and the Marquis of Steyne to get him promoted. She also uses her feminine wiles to distract men at card parties while Rawdon cheats them blind. Marrying Rawdon Crawley in secret was a mistake, as was running off instead of begging Miss Crawley's forgiveness. She also fails to manipulate Miss Crawley through Rawdon so as to obtain an inheritance. Although Becky manipulates men very easily, she is less successful with women. She is utterly hostile to Lady Bareacres<ref>{{harvp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110 110\u2013111]}}.</ref>, dismissive of Mrs. O'Dowd, and Lady Jane, although initially friendly, eventually distrusts and dislikes her. The exceptions to this trend are (at least initially) Miss Crawley, her companion Miss Briggs, and her school friend Amelia; the latter is the recipient of more-or-less the only kindnesses Becky expresses in the work, persuading her to marry Dobbin in light of what Becky comes to appreciate to be his good qualities and protecting Amelia from two ruffians vying for her attentions. This comparative loyalty to Amelia stems from Becky having no other friends at school, and Amelia having \"by a thousand kind words and offices, overcome... (Becky's) hostility\"; 'The gentle tender-hearted Amelia Sedley was the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least; and who could help attaching herself to Amelia?' Beginning with her determination to be her \"own Mamma\", Becky begins to assume the role of [[Clytemnestra]].{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=22 ff}} Becky and her necklace from Steyne also allude to the fallen [[Eriphyle]] in [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s [[Iphig\u00e9nie|retelling]] of ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'', where she [[Foil (literature)|doubles]] and rescues Iphigenia.{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=30 ff}} In lesser contexts, Becky also appears as [[Arachne]] to Miss Pinkerton's [[Minerva]]{{sfnp|York|1997|pp=24 ff}} and as a variety of classical figures in the works' illustrations.\n\n=== Rawdon Crawley ===\nRawdon, the younger of the two Crawley sons, is an empty-headed cavalry officer who is his wealthy aunt's favourite until he marries Becky Sharp, who is of a far lower class. He permanently alienates his aunt, who leaves her estate to Rawdon's elder brother Sir Pitt instead. Sir Pitt has by this time inherited their father's estate, leaving Rawdon destitute.\n\nThe well-meaning Rawdon does have a few talents in life, most of them having to do with gambling and duelling. He is very good at cards and billiards, and although he does not always win he is able to earn cash by betting against less talented gamblers. He is heavily indebted throughout most of the book, not so much for his own expenses as for Becky's. Not particularly talented as a military officer, he is content to let Becky manage his career.\n\nAlthough Rawdon knows Becky is attractive to men, he believes her reputation is spotless even though she is widely suspected of romantic intrigue with General Tufto and other powerful men. Nobody dares to suggest otherwise to Rawdon because of his temper and his reputation for duelling. Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.\n\nAfter Rawdon finds out the truth and leaves Becky for an assignment overseas, he leaves his son to be brought up by his brother Sir Pitt and his wife Lady Jane. While overseas, Rawdon dies of yellow fever.\n\n=== Pitt Crawley ===\nRawdon Crawley's elder brother inherits the Crawley estate from his father, the boorish and vulgar Sir Pitt, and also inherits the estate of his wealthy aunt, Miss Crawley, after she disinherits Rawdon. Pitt is very religious and has political aspirations, although not many people appreciate his intelligence or wisdom because there's not much there to appreciate. Somewhat pedantic and conservative, Pitt does nothing to help Rawdon or Becky even when they fall on hard times. This is chiefly due to the influence of his wife, Lady Jane, who dislikes Becky because of her callous treatment of her son, and also because Becky repaid Lady Jane's earlier kindness by patronising her and flirting with Sir Pitt.\n\n=== Miss Matilda Crawley ===\nThe elderly Miss Crawley is everyone's favourite wealthy aunt. Sir Pitt and Rawdon both dote on her, although Rawdon is her favourite nephew and sole heir until he marries Becky. While Miss Crawley likes Becky and keeps her around to entertain her with sarcasm and wit, and while she loves scandal and particularly stories of unwise marriage, she does not want scandal or unwise marriage in her family. A substantial part of the early section of the book deals with the efforts the Crawleys make to kowtow to Miss Crawley in the hope of receiving a big inheritance.\n\nHer portrayal is informed by Thackeray's time in Paris with his maternal grandmother Harriet Becher.<ref>{{citation |last=Shillingsburg |first=Peter |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography }}.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== George Osborne ===\nGeorge Osborne, his father (a merchant, of considerably superior social status to Dobbin's grocer father, albeit self made, and ironically a mere corporal in the City Light Horse regiment of which Dobbin senior, by this time an alderman and a knight, is colonel), and his two sisters are close to the Sedley family until Mr. Sedley (the father of Jos and Amelia, and George Osborne's godfather, from whom the latter takes his middle name of 'Sedley') goes bankrupt following some ill-advised speculation. Since George and Amelia were raised in close company and were childhood sweethearts, George defies his father to marry Amelia. Before father and son can be reconciled, George is killed at the battle of Waterloo, leaving the pregnant Amelia to carry on as well as she can.\n\nRaised to be a selfish, vain, profligate spender, handsome and self-obsessed, George squanders the last of the money he receives from his father and sets nothing aside to help support Amelia. After marrying Amelia, he finds after a couple of weeks that he is bored. He flirts with Becky quite seriously and is reconciled to Amelia only a short time before he is killed in battle.\n\n=== William Dobbin ===\nThe best friend of George Osborne, Captain William Dobbin is tall, ungainly, and not particularly handsome. He is a few years older than George but has been friends with him since his schooldays, even though Dobbin's father is a fig-merchant (Dobbin & Rudge, grocers and oilmen, Thames Street, London - he is later an alderman and colonel of the City Light Horse regiment, and knighted) and the Osbornes belong to the genteel class and have become independently wealthy. He defends George and is blind to his faults in many ways, although he tries to force George to do the right thing. He pushes George to keep his promise to marry Amelia even though Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself. After George is killed, Dobbin puts together an annuity to help support Amelia, ostensibly with the help of George's fellow officers.\n\nLater, Major and Lieutenant Colonel Dobbin discreetly does what he can to help support Amelia and her son George. He allows Amelia to continue with her obsession over George and does not correct her erroneous beliefs about him. He hangs about for years, either pining away over her while serving in India or waiting on her in person, allowing her to take advantage of his good nature. After Amelia finally chooses Becky's friendship over his during their stay in Germany, Dobbin leaves in disgust. He returns when Amelia writes to him and admits her feelings for him, marries her (despite having lost much of his passion for her), and has a daughter whom he loves deeply.\n\n=== Joseph Sedley ===\nAmelia's older brother, Joseph \"Jos\" Sedley, is a \"[[nabob]]\", who made a respectable fortune as a [[District collector|collector]] in India. Obese and self-important but very shy and insecure, he is attracted to Becky Sharp but circumstances prevent him from proposing. He never marries, but when he meets Becky again he is easily manipulated into falling in love with her. Jos is not a courageous or intelligent man, displaying his cowardice at the Battle of Waterloo by trying to flee and purchasing both of Becky's overpriced horses. Becky ensnares him again near the end of the book and, it is hinted, murders him for his life insurance.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Vanity Fair Prospectus.png|Right|200px|thumb|The 1847 [[prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for the ''Vanity Fair: Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society'' serial, advertising it under [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s pen name Michael Angelo Titmarsh and under his own name.]]\n[[File:Houghton EC85 T3255 848vb - Vanity Fair, title.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The title page of the 1848 first edition of ''Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero''.]]\n[[File:Vanity Fair D720.png|thumb|right|200px|''Becky's second appearance in the character of [[Clytemnestra]]'', an illustration and caption by Thackeray that makes it clear he considered her to have killed Jos for his insurance money.<ref name=bigmac/>]]\nThackeray may have begun working out some of the details of ''Vanity Fair'' as early as 1841 but probably began writing it in late 1844.{{refn|Tillotson & al.,{{sfnp|Tillotson & al.|1963|pp=xvii ff.}} cited in York.{{sfnp|York|1997|p=29}}}} Like many novels of the time, ''Vanity Fair'' was published as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] before being sold in book form.

Woodcut engravings, which could be set along with normal moveable type, appeared within the text. The same engraved illustration appeared on the canary-yellow cover of each monthly part; this colour became Thackeray's signature, as a light blue-green was Dickens's, allowing passers-by to notice a new Thackeray number in a bookstall from a distance. ''Vanity Fair'' was the first work that Thackeray published under his own name and was extremely well received at the time. After the conclusion of its serial publication, it was printed as a bound volume by Bradbury & Evans in 1848 and was quickly picked up by other London printers as well. As a collected work, the novels bore the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero''.{{efn|In addition to its other intentions, the name was a jab at [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s \"Lectures on Hero and Hero-Worship\".{{sfnp|Sutherland|1988|loc=\"Carlyle & Carlylism\"}}}} By the end of 1859, [[royalties]] on ''Vanity Fair'' had only given Thackeray about [[GBP|\u00a3]]2000, a third of his take from ''[[The Virginians]]'', but was responsible for his still more lucrative lecture tours in Britain and the United States.<ref name=castaway>{{harvp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA13 13]}}.</ref>{{efn|In the letter where he recorded these sums, Thackeray noted \"Three more years please the [[Fates]] and the girls will have eight or ten thousand a-piece that I want for them: we must n't<!--sic--> say a word against filthy lucre for I see the use and comfort of it every day more and more. What a blessing not to mind about bills.\"<ref name=castaway/>}}\n\nFrom his first draft and following publication, Thackeray occasionally revised his allusions to make them more accessible for his readers. In Chapter 5, an original \"Prince Whadyecallem\"<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n63/mode/2up 36]}}.</ref> became \"Prince Ahmed\" by the 1853 edition.{{sfnp|York|1997|p=28}} In Chapter 13, a passage about the filicidal [[Bible|Biblical]] figure [[Jephthah]] was removed, although references to [[Iphigenia]] remained important.{{sfnp|York|1997|p=28}} In Chapter 56, Thackeray originally confused [[Samuel]] \u2013 the boy whose mother [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] had given him up when called to by [[Jewish God|God]] \u2013 with [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]],<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n591/mode/2up 504] }}.</ref> the old priest to whose care he was entrusted; this mistake was not corrected until the 1889 edition,{{sfnp|York|1997|p=133}} after Thackeray's death.\n\nThe serials had been subtitled ''Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society'' and both they and the early bound versions featured Thackeray's own illustrations. These sometimes provided symbolically-freighted images, such as one of the female characters being portrayed as a man-eating [[mermaid]]. In at least one case, a major plot point is provided through an image and its caption. Although the text makes it clear that other characters suspect Becky Sharp to have murdered her second husband, there is nothing definitive in the text itself. However, an image reveals her overhearing Jos pleading with Dobbin while clutching a small white object in her hand. The caption that this is ''Becky's second appearance in the character of [[Clytemnestra]]'' clarifies that she did indeed murder him for the insurance money,<ref name=highwater/> likely through [[laudanum]] or another poison.{{sfnp|Dibattista|1980}}<ref name=bigmac>{{citation |contribution=W.M.

A letter to his editor at ''[[Punch, or the London Charivari|Punch]]'' expressed his belief that \"our profession... is as serious as the [[parson]]'s own\".<ref name=poohcorner>{{harvp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA108 108]}}.</ref> He considered it his own coming-of-age as a writer{{efn|To a German visitor who told him he had learned to read English from ''Vanity Fair'', Thackeray replied \"And that's where I learned to write it\".{{sfnp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA85 85]}}}} and greatest work.<ref name=house>{{harvp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA86 86]}}.</ref>\n\nCritics hailed the work as a literary treasure before the last part of the serial was published. In her correspondence, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] was effusive regarding his illustrations as well: \"You will not easily find a second Thackeray. How he can render, with a few black lines and dots, shades of expression, so fine, so real; traits of character so minute, so subtle, so difficult to seize and fix, I cannot tell\u2014I can only wonder and admire... If Truth were again a goddess, Thackeray should be her high priest.\"{{sfnp|Wilson & al.|1970|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Z-U2aQz1NqgC&pg=PA8 8]}} The early reviewers took the debt to Bunyan as self-evident and compared Becky with Pilgrim and Thackeray with Faithful.<ref name=poohcorner/> Although they were superlative in their praise,<ref>See, e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' review of 10 July 1848.</ref> some expressed disappointment at the unremittingly dark portrayal of human nature, fearing Thackeray had taken his dismal metaphor too far. In response to these critics, Thackeray explained that he saw people for the most part as \"abominably foolish and selfish\".{{sfnp|Ray|1946|p=309}} The unhappy ending was intended to inspire readers to look inward at their own shortcomings. Other critics took notice of or exception to the social subversion in the work; in his correspondence, Thackeray stated his criticism was not reserved to the upper class: \"My object is to make every body engaged, engaged in the pursuit of Vanity Fair and I must carry my story through in this dreary minor key, with only occasional hints here and there of better things\u2014of better things which it does not become me to preach\".<ref name=thisonegoestoeleven>{{harvp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA111 111]}}.</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\n{{Original research section|date=August 2015}}\nThe novel is considered a classic of English literature, though some critics claim that it has structural problems; Thackeray sometimes lost track of the huge scope of his work, mixing up characters' names and minor plot details. The number of allusions and references it contains can make it difficult for modern readers to follow.\n\nThe subtitle, ''A Novel without a Hero'', is apt because the characters are all flawed to a greater or lesser degree; even the most sympathetic have weaknesses, for example Captain Dobbin, who is prone to [[vanity]] and [[melancholia|melancholy]]. The human weaknesses Thackeray illustrates are mostly to do with [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]], [[laziness|idleness]], and [[snob]]bery, and the scheming, [[lie|deceit]] and [[hypocrisy]] which mask them. None of the characters are wholly evil, although Becky's manipulative, amoral tendencies make her come pretty close. However, even Becky, who is amoral and cunning, is thrown on her own resources by poverty and its stigma. (She is the orphaned daughter of a poor artist and an opera dancer.) Thackeray's tendency to highlight faults in all of his characters displays his desire for a greater level of [[Literary realism|realism]] in his fiction compared to the rather unlikely or idealised people in many contemporary novels.\n\nThe novel is a satire of society as a whole, characterised by hypocrisy and [[opportunism]], but it is not a reforming novel; there is no suggestion that social or political changes or greater piety and [[Victorian morality|moral reformism]] could improve the nature of society. It thus paints a fairly bleak view of the human condition. This bleak portrait is continued with Thackeray's own role as an [[omniscient narrator]], one of the writers best known for using the technique. He continually offers asides about his characters and compares them to actors and puppets, but his cheek goes even as far as his readers, accusing all who may be interested in such \"Vanity Fairs\" as being either \"of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood\".<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n15/mode/2up viii] |year=1848 }}.</ref> As [[Lord David Cecil]] remarked, \"Thackeray liked people, and for the most part he thought them well-intentioned. But he also saw very clearly that they were all in some degree weak and vain, self-absorbed and self-deceived.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Cecil |first=David |author-link=Lord David Cecil |title=Early Victorian Novelists |publisher=Constable |year=1934 |page=69}}.</ref> Amelia begins as a warm-hearted and friendly girl, though sentimental and naive, but by the story's end she is portrayed as vacuous and shallow. Dobbin appears first as loyal and magnanimous, if unaware of his own worth; by the end of the story he is presented as a tragic fool, a prisoner of his own sense of duty who knows he is wasting his gifts on Amelia but is unable to live without her. The novel's increasingly grim outlook can take readers aback, as characters whom the reader at first holds in sympathy are shown to be unworthy of such regard.\n\nThe work is often compared to the other great historical novel of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.{{efn|Examples include Carey's ''Prodigal Genius''<ref>{{cite book |last=Carey |first=John |author-link=John Carey (critic) |title=Thackeray: Prodigal Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/thackerayprodiga0000care |url-access=registration |publisher=Faber |year=1977}}</ref> and McAloon's defence of the work in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''.<ref>{{citation |last=McAloon |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/why-vanity-fair-is-the-greatest-novel-about-waterloo/ |title=Why ''Vanity Fair'' Is the Greatest Novel about Waterloo |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=20 June 2015 }}.</ref>}} While Tolstoy's work has a greater emphasis on the historical detail and the effect the war has upon his protagonists, Thackeray instead uses the conflict as a backdrop to the lives of his characters. The momentous events on the continent do not always have an equally important influence on the behaviours of Thackeray's characters. Rather their faults tend to compound over time. This is in contrast to the redemptive power the conflict has on the characters in ''War and Peace''. For Thackeray, the Napoleonic wars as a whole can be thought of as one more of the vanities expressed in the title.\n\nA common critical topic is to address various objects in the book and the characters' relationships with them, such as Rebecca's diamonds or the piano Amelia values when she thinks it came from George and dismisses upon learning that Dobbin provided it. [[Marxist criticism|Marxist]] and similar schools of criticism that go further and see Thackeray condemning [[consumerism]] and capitalism, however, largely overstate their case.{{sfnp|Milne|2015|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8lEQCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 114]}} Thackeray is pointed in his criticism of the commodification of women in the marriage market, but his variations on [[Ecclesiastes]]'s \"[[all is vanity]]\"<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |pp=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n529/mode/2up 450] & [https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n721/mode/2up 624]}}.</ref> are more personal than institutional. He also has broad sympathy with a measure of comfort and financial and physical \"snugness\". At one point, the narrator even makes a \"robust defense of his lunch\":<ref name=thisonegoestoeleven/> \"It is all vanity to be sure: but who will not own to liking a little of it? I should like to know what well-constituted mind, merely because it is transitory, dislikes roast-beef?\"<ref>{{citation |title=Vanity Fair |year=1848 |url=https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n529/mode/2up 450]}}.</ref>\n\nDespite the clear implications of Thackeray's illustration on the topic, [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] has argued against Becky having murdered Jos on the basis of Thackeray's criticism of the \"[[Newgate novel]]s\" of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] and other authors of Victorian crime fiction.{{efn|The trio of lawyers Becky gets to defend herself from the claims\u2014Burke, Thurtell, and Hayes\u2014are named after prominent murderers of the time, although this may have been a tease or commentary on the legal profession itself.}} Although what Thackeray principally objected to was glorification of a criminal's deeds, his intent may have been to entrap the Victorian reader with their own prejudices and make them think the worst of Becky Sharp even when they have no proof of her actions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sutherland, John |author-link=John Sutherland (author) |title=Is Heathcliff A Murderer?: Great Puzzles in Nineteenth-century Fiction |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[File:Vanity Fair lobby card 1923.JPG|thumb|Right|200px|The [[lobby card]] for the [[Vanity Fair (1923 film)|1923 ''Vanity Fair'']], a [[lost film]] whose Becky Sharp was the [[Hugo Ballin|director]]'s [[Mabel Ballin|wife]]]]\n[[File:Vanityfair1932.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Myrna Loy]] as an early 20th-century Becky Sharp in the [[Vanity Fair (1932 film)|1932 ''Vanity Fair'']]]]\n[[File:Vanity Fair 2004 poster.jpg|thumb|Right|200px|[[Reese Witherspoon]] as the sympathetic Becky Sharp of the 2004 ''Vanity Fair'']]\nThe book has inspired a number of adaptations:\n\n===Radio===\n*''Vanity Fair'' (7 January 1940), the [[CBS Radio]] series ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|Campbell Playhouse]]'', hosted by [[Orson Welles]], broadcast a one-hour adaptation featuring [[Helen Hayes]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]].\n*''Vanity Fair'' (6 December 1947), the [[NBC Radio]] series ''[[Favorite Story]]'', hosted by [[Ronald Colman]], broadcast a half-hour adaptation with [[Joan Lorring]] as \"Becky Sharp\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Vanity Fair|work=Favorite Story|date=6 December 1947|publisher=Old Time Radio Downloads|}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Vanity Fair|work=Favorite Story|publisher=Old Time Radio |date=6 December 1947|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PD78Usb9R4}}</ref>\n*''Vanity Fair'' (2004), [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast an adaptation of the novel by [[Stephen Wyatt]], starring [[Emma Fielding]] as Becky, [[Stephen Fry]] as the Narrator, [[Katy Cavanagh]] as Amelia, [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]], [[Philip Fox (actor)|Philip Fox]], [[Jon Glover]], [[Geoffrey Whitehead]] as Mr. Osborne, Ian Masters as Mr. Sedley, Alice Hart as Maria Osborne, and [[Margaret Tyzack]] as Miss Crawley; this was subsequently re-broadcast on [[BBC Radio 7]] in 20 fifteen-minute episodes.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n*''Vanity Fair'' (2019), [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a three-part adaptation of the novel by Jim Poyser with additional material by [[Al Murray]] (Thackeray's actual descendant, who also stars as Thackeray),<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0005dyt</ref> with Ellie White as Becky Sharp, Helen O'Hara as Amelia Sedley, [[Blake Ritson]] as Rawdon Crawley, [[Rupert Hill]] as George Osborne and [[Graeme Hawley]] as Dobbin.\n\n===Silent films===\n*''Vanity Fair'' (1911), directed by [[Charles Kent (actor)|Charles Kent]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Vanity Fair|date=1911|publisher=Films 101|url=http://www.films101.com/17095.htm}}</ref>\n*[[Vanity Fair (1915 film)|''Vanity Fair'']] (1915), directed by Charles Brabin\n*''[[Vanity Fair (1922 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1922), directed by W.
