On a small number of [[Europe]]an dates in June 2005, Mark Fletcher (from Miller's [[In Cahoots]] band) reinforced the band while Pyle was recuperating from a back operation and only played on part of each gig. Pyle died in August 2006 after travelling back from a Hatfield show in Groningen.  Following Pyle's death, Hatfield played two previously booked gigs with Mark Fletcher on drums, including the [[Canterbury Festival]] in October 2006.\n\nIn 2005/2006, the band released two archival collections, ''[[Hatwise Choice: Archive Recordings 1973-1975, Volume 1]]'' and ''[[Hattitude: Archive Recordings 1973-1975, Volume 2]]'', featuring the classic Miller/Pyle/Sinclair/Stewart line-up, distributed by the UK label [[Burning Shed]]. Both releases contained a mixture of BBC radio sessions and live recordings, along with the odd demo, which are still available on CD and support the musicians and family of Pip Pyle.\n\nIn 2007, [[Cuneiform Records]] re-released two albums by Steve Miller and [[Lol Coxhill]] with bonus material including 20 minutes of material by the proto-Hatfield and the North line-up of Delivery playing \"God Song\", \"Bossa Nochance/Big Jobs\", and \"Betty\" (a variation on some of the Sinclair bass riffs that also produced Hatfield's \"Rifferama\").\n\n[[Jonathan Coe]]'s 2001 novel ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'' takes its title from the band's second album.

A total of 3 spin-offs were produced, [[Mister Maker Comes to Town]], Mister Maker Around the World and Mister Maker's Arty Party, which began airing on pin 2010, 2013 and 2015 respectively. Mister Maker is portrayed by [[Phil Gallagher]].\n==Episode sequence==\nEvery episode has the following sequence:\n\n# Create Idea\n# Shape Game\n# Minute Make It Time\n# Colour Kids\n# Frame It\n# Creative Idea\n# Time To Go\n\nMister Maker does something interesting and that gives him an idea of what to make. He collects the required things from the Doodle drawers or an art and craft shop and makes it. Then he wakes up '''''the shapes''''' who perform a song and a dance, followed by a randomly selected shape (circle, triangle, square or rectangle) to form a picture or to find how many (particular shape) are there. '''''Tocky''''' the cuckoo clock (a [[puppet]] bird), then pops out for '''''Minute Make Time''''' and Mister Maker will make something in a minute, usually completing it just before the timer stops. The '''''colour kids''''' (Jodie Griffiths, Olivia Lockett, Mackenzie Roylance, Georgia Pickles and Amy Lees) will ask from the window to Mister Maker to guess what they would make with their 'colour costumes'. It is followed by '''''Frame It''''' where Mister Maker makes something 'ever so good' that the viewers will be able to frame it. Mister Maker will be confronted by something, and that will give him an idea on what to make next.

He collects the required things from the Doodle drawers or an art and craft shop and makes it. Then he wakes up '''''the shapes''''' who perform a song and a dance, followed by a randomly selected shape (circle, triangle, square or rectangle) to form a picture or to find how many (particular shape) are there. '''''Tocky''''' the cuckoo clock (a [[puppet]] bird), then pops out for '''''Minute Make Time''''' and Mister Maker will make something in a minute, usually completing it just before the timer stops. The '''''colour kids''''' (Jodie Griffiths, Olivia Lockett, Mackenzie Roylance, Georgia Pickles and Amy Lees) will ask from the window to Mister Maker to guess what they would make with their 'colour costumes'. It is followed by '''''Frame It''''' where Mister Maker makes something 'ever so good' that the viewers will be able to frame it.

He showed intolerance to fatty foods, especially pork &ndash; these caused [[stomach ache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and weight loss. Later he endeavored to avoid such symptoms with diet; he obtained substantial improvement with ingredients such as [[honey]] and [[oat bran]].

In 1830, a chronic cold caused nasal [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] which prompted him to cancel planned concerts in Vienna.\n\nIn 1831, while in Paris, the 21-year-old Chopin had his first episode of [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up of blood). In 1835, he suffered a severe two-month bout of [[laryngitis]] and [[bronchitis]], and the resulting interruption in his correspondence with Warsaw gave rise to gossip that he had died.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers.

In the final decade of his life, he treated the coughing fits from which he had suffered his entire life with a blend of sugar and [[opium]]. Chopin coughed up an abundant amount of [[mucus]], particularly around 10 a.m.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 143. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}</ref> He occasionally drank alcohol, sometimes smoked and &ndash; as some authors noted &ndash; suffered the consequences of inhaling others' smoke while enjoying the company of his Parisian friends.<ref name=\"a\" /> In the last year of his life, he endured diarrheas, caused either by [[cor pulmonale]] or by [[exocrine pancreatic insufficiency]] (see below).\n\nOn 17 October 1849, at 2 a.m., after a sudden coughing fit, Chopin died at the age of 39. His physician, [[Jean Cruveilhier]], confirmed his death by holding a mirror to Chopin's mouth and by illuminating his pupils with light from a candle. Pursuant to Chopin's will, Dr. Cruveilhier, a renowned professor of [[pathology]], carried out an [[autopsy]]. The postmortem findings were also communicated to Chopin's sister [[Ludwika J\u0119drzejewicz|Ludwika]], [[Adolphe Gutmann]] and [[Jane Stirling]]. The postmortem report was destroyed either in the Paris fire of 1871 or during World War II. The [[death certificate]] stated the cause of Chopin's death as tuberculosis of the lungs and larynx.
