As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nPartimenti, or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century. Because learning the Italian style of music was a priority for almost any eighteenth-century musician, many well-known non-Italian composers, including Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, also studied or taught partimenti. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]],  Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rises to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

Bass motions move in a conjunct (stepwise, including chromatic) motion or disjunct motion (sequences).{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=135}}\n\n=== Rises by a 3rd and falls by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 e d f e g f a g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by a 3rd and rises by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 a b g a f g e f d e c g' c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 4th and falls by a 3rd ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 f d g e a  f g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n=== Falls by a 4th and rises by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 g a e f c g' c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 4th and falls by a 5th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                g1 c fis, b e, a d, g c, d g,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by a 5th and rises by a 4th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 f, bes es, as d, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n=== Rises by a 5th and falls by a 4th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 g' d a' e b' g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 6th and falls by a 5th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 a' d, b' e, c' f, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by semitone ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                g1 fis f!

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, John Mortensen, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rises to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

It also furthered her growing penchant for writing topical songs about social issues. \n\nThe album was recorded at the Hit Factory, Sigma Sound, Messina Sound, Right Track, The Enchanted Cottage, The Ranch, and World Famous Orbit Sound. It was co-produced by dance-music artist [[Junior Vasquez]] and is highly typical of his work of the time; as such, many of the songs are held together by synthetic loops and percussion. Lyrics address issues like [[abortion]] (\"[[Sally's Pigeons]]\"), [[racism]] (\"A Part Hate\"), [[spousal abuse]] (\"Product of Misery\" and \"Broken Glass\") and [[incest]] (\"Lies\"). The track \"Product of Misery\" was inspired by a teacher of Lauper's, Bob Barrell, who described the masses of struggling people as a 'product of misery' and that misery begets misery unless the chain is broken.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=39|quote=|via=}}</ref> The song \"A Part Hate\" was conceived as an anti-[[apartheid]] song and was originally written for Lauper's second album ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' but was not included because her label felt it would make the album too political; it already had a cover of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\" and the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|title track]] included.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=166|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe album cover was inspired by a photograph of the actress [[Mary Pickford]], taken by photographer Nelson Evans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|title=Picture of Mary Pickford,taken by Nelson Evans|accessdate=June 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628184717/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|archivedate=28 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLauper has commented that she wishes that her vocals on the project had been sharper. She worked with a vocal coach to sharpen her vocals for her next studio album ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and mentions this in the liner notes.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe album had limited success due to lack of promotion on the part of Cyndi's label. It was considered a commercial disappointment in the [[United States]] and despite some positive critical reviews it stalled at No. 112 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. As of 2003, the album has sold 119,000 copies in the US, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].\n\nThe album fared better overseas, becoming most successful in Japan and France, achieving a Gold certification in both countries. In Japan, the album spent a total of 7 weeks on the albums chart, peaking at 15.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20121024044213/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/79864/ranking/cd_album/</ref> In France the album debuted at 10 before reaching its peak of 9 the following week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infodisc.fr/Album_ChartRuns.php|title=Les \"Charts Runs\" de chaque Album Class\u00e9|language=French|publisher=InfoDisc|accessdate=February 3, 2020}}</ref> This was both her highest debut and peak for a studio album in France and it stayed in the Top 40 for 7 weeks. \n\nThe album achieved lower chart positions in the rest of Europe.

It also furthered her growing penchant for writing topical songs about social issues. \n\nThe album was recorded at the Hit Factory, Sigma Sound, Messina Sound, Right Track, The Enchanted Cottage, The Ranch, and World Famous Orbit Sound. It was co-produced by dance-music artist [[Junior Vasquez]] and is highly typical of his work of the time; as such, many of the songs are held together by synthetic loops and percussion. Lyrics address issues like [[abortion]] (\"[[Sally's Pigeons]]\"), [[racism]] (\"A Part Hate\"), [[spousal abuse]] (\"Product of Misery\" and \"Broken Glass\") and [[incest]] (\"Lies\"). The track \"Product of Misery\" was inspired by a teacher of Lauper's, Bob Barrell, who described the masses of struggling people as a 'product of misery' and that misery begets misery unless the chain is broken.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=39|quote=|via=}}</ref> The song \"A Part Hate\" was conceived as an anti-[[apartheid]] song and was originally written for Lauper's second album ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' but was not included because her label felt it would make the album too political; it already had a cover of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\" and the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|title track]] included.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=166|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe album cover was inspired by a photograph of the actress [[Mary Pickford]], taken by photographer Nelson Evans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|title=Picture of Mary Pickford,taken by Nelson Evans|accessdate=June 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628184717/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|archivedate=28 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLauper has commented that she wishes that her vocals on the project had been sharper. She worked with a vocal coach to sharpen her vocals for her next studio album ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and mentions this in the liner notes.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe album had limited success due to lack of promotion on the part of Cyndi's label. It was considered a commercial disappointment in the [[United States]] and despite some positive critical reviews it stalled at No. 112 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. As of 2003, the album has sold 119,000 copies in the US, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].\n\nThe album fared better overseas, becoming most successful in Japan and France, achieving a Gold certification in both countries.

It was the longest English Parliament, enduring for nearly 18 years of the quarter-century reign of [[Charles II of England]]. Like its predecessor, the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], it was overwhelmingly [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and is also known as the '''Pensioner Parliament''' for the many [[pension]]s it granted to adherents of the King.<ref>''The London Magazine'', May\u2013August 1827, Hunt and Clarke, 1827.

A list of Members of Parliament who were receiving a state salary or pension in the early 1670s.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first session of the Cavalier Parliament opened on May 8, 1661.  Among the first orders of business was the confirmation of the acts of the previous year's irregular [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention of 1660]] as legitimate (notably, the [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]]).  Parliament immediately ordered the public burning of the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] by a common hangman.<ref>Cobbett, ''Parliamentary History'', Vol. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ma0_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT140#v=onepage&q&f=false 208-09]</ref>  It also [[Clergy Act 1661|repealed]] the 1642 [[Bishops Exclusion Act]], thereby allowing [[Church of England]] bishops to resume their temporal positions, including their seats in the [[House of Lords]].  Other notable pieces of first session legislation include the [[The King's Sole Right over the Militia Act 1661|Militia Act]] placing the armed forces unambiguously under the king's authority, and the [[Sedition Act 1661|Sedition Act]]. It also continued proceedings against the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides of Charles I]].\n\nLater that same year (1661), Parliament passed the [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Act]], the first of a series of acts known as the [[Clarendon Code]], to cement the episcopal Anglican church as the official church of England.  The Clarendon code is normally given as the following four acts:\n* the [[Corporation Act 1661]]\n* the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]]\n* the [[Conventicle Act 1664]]\n* the [[Five Mile Act 1665]].\n\nThe [[Quaker Act 1662]], specifically targeting [[Quakers]], can also be cited as part of the new religious 'code'. In January 1661, the [[Fifth Monarchists]], anticipating the arrival of [[Jesus Christ]] to claim the throne, led a succession of revolts under the command of [[Vavasor Powell]] and [[Thomas Venner]]. To silence radical agitators and pamphleteers, Parliament passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]], instituting government censorship of the press.\n\nOn the economic legislation, the Cavalier parliament had a notable [[Mercantilist]] bent.  To promote the English cloth industry, it outlawed the exportation of raw materials, such as [[wool]], [[hide (skin)|raw hides]] and [[fuller's earth|fuller's clay]] (1662) and forbade the importation of finished materials like [[lace]] and [[embroidery]] (1662). It repealed old domestic restrictions on [[linen]] manufacturing (1663).  To encourage the development of the [[British America|American colonies]] as raw-material producers and consumers of English manufactured goods, the Cavalier parliament confirmed and reinforced the [[Navigation Act]] passed by the prior parliament in 1660, with the new [[Staple Act 1663|Staple Act]] in 1663, requiring foreigners trading with the American colonies to transship their goods through English ports.  Old [[corn laws]] were adjusted to the advantage of English farmers: the old restrictions on the exportation of wheat was gradually relaxed, exportation becoming fully free in 1670 and even subsidized with [[export subsidy|bounties]] after 1673. Conversely, the importation of wheat was restricted, with the first [[protectionism|prohibitive tariffs]] on the importation of grains introduced in 1663 in a two-tier system, adjusted (1670) into a three-tier system based on current price.  The [[Importation Act 1667|importation of Irish cattle]] into Britain was forbidden (1666), giving English beef producers a protected home market (in trade, Scotland was already excluded altogether, treated as a foreign country on par with France).  To facilitate the overseas operations of the [[chartered company|charter companies]], parliament inserted a clause into the 1663 Staple Act allowing the free exportation of [[precious metal|coin and bullion]] - over the vigorous opposition of [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey|Arthur Annesley (Earl Anglesey)]], the leading mercantilist in parliament. To encourage the inflow of gold and silver from abroad and into circulation, the [[Coinage Act 1666]] abolished [[seignorage]], and introduced free minting at the [[Royal Mint]].\n\nThe prior [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention of 1660]] had promised King Charles II a generous annual revenue of \u00a31.2 million, secured on [[customs duties]] and [[excise tax]]es.  It was up to Cavalier parliament to ensure that the promise was kept.  But in the first few years, the revenue fell short of the promised amount, and parliament had to look for new ways to make up for it.  Parliament was responsible for the introduction of the controversial [[hearth tax]] (1662), with its unpopular and intrusive method of assessment (tax collectors had to go inside everyone's private homes to count [[hearth]]s). Another problem also emerged at this time: the sudden rise in the number of [[pauper]]s, which had catapulted with the demobilization of the army.  It was feared they would migrate ''en masse'' to the better-off [[parish]]es and swamp their social assistance programs.  So, in another controversial piece of legislation, parliament changed the Elizabethan [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]] with the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Act of Settlement and Removal]] (1662), legally restricting the poor to seeking assistance in their own home parish.\n\nOther significant and curious pieces of early legislation include the first licensing of [[hackney carriage]]s (1662), an act against \"excessive gaming\" (1663) and a famous 1663 act authorizing the erection of [[toll road|toll gates]] on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], the prelude to a series of acts to help finance road-building for highways. \n[[Image:Verschuier-fire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Great Fire of London]].]]\n\nIn 1664, the Cavalier parliament amended the old [[Triennial Act]] so that it was now only suggested (rather than required) that the king summon a parliamentary session at least once every three years. In 1665, parliament met in [[Oxford]] to escape the [[Great Plague of London]]. The next year, in the aftermath of the [[Great Fire of London]] which ravaged the city in September 1666, parliament set up a court to settle disputes between landlords and tenants of burned buildings ([[Fire of London Disputes Act 1666]]), and passed a series of acts setting down regulations for rebuilding of the city ([[Rebuilding of London Act 1666]]).\n\nMercantilist agitation had prompted parliament to support the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1665. But when the war turned out poorly in 1667, parliament decided to lay the blame on Charles II's chief minister [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde (Earl of Clarendon)]] and the king's brother and lord admiral, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]].  Parliament, echoing public belief, accused that the money voted for the war had been embezzled by court officers.  Under pressure, Charles consented to setting up an independent commission for inquiry, but the verdict was inconclusive. Nonetheless, parliament decided to launch impeachment proceedings against Clarendon. Before these bore fruit, Clarendon went into exile.\n\nClarendon's departure opened the way for the rise of a new crop of young ministers, known as \"the [[Cabal Ministry|Cabal]]\", a loose ministerial coalition consisting of [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Arlington]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Ashley]], [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lauderdale]].  The beginnings of what is now called a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] system began to emerge within the government. Sir [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]], who had long stressed parliamentary prerogative in tying expenditures to specific sources (rather than just voting for supply and letting the crown allocate as it saw fit), became secretary to the Treasury, and helped overhaul crown finances, finally putting them on a steady course.\n\nNonetheless, parliament was shocked when, in 1668, the Cabal announced the \"[[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]\", which brought England into alliance with her recent enemy, the [[Dutch Republic]]. Although a league of northern Protestant powers had some appeal, mercantilist sentiment in parliament was still very strong, and the Netherlands was still seen as the main threat to England.  Disillusioned by the lukewarm reception, Charles II re-oriented his foreign policy and struck up the notorious secret [[Treaty of Dover]] in May 1670, allying England and [[Louis XIV]]'s France, in a plan to dismember the Netherlands.\n\nDespite their comparative energy and efficiency, the Cabal was a fractious and unpopular lot and their infighting spilled over publicly into parliament, particularly the [[House of Lords]].  At this stage, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] was ''de facto'' subservient to Lords, \"managed from above\" by the Lords' handlers, following their lead and echoing their quarrels. But Commons soon began to find its own voice. Finding the Cabal insufferable, Sir [[William Coventry]] resigned as Secretary to the Admiralty and went back to the House of Commons, where he emerged in 1669 as the formidable leader of a group of parliamentarians known as the \"Country Party\" - a group of MPs held together by their suspicion of corruption in high places, suspicious of the king's dubious foreign policy and, increasingly, suspicious of his loyalty to Protestantism.  The factions of a \"party political\" system thus gradually emerged in parliament, polarised between the Coventry-led \"Country Party\" (ancestral to the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]]) and the \"Court Party\" (supporters of the king's council, ancestral to the [[Tories]]).\n\nThe new self-assurance of Commons was felt in a quarrel that erupted during the 9th Session in 1670 between Lords and Commons, where Commons assailed the Lords' assumption that they had the right to amend their revenue bills. Finding their handlers could no longer control Commons, and that the goodwill that had attended Charles II at the Restoration was wearing thin, the Cabal recommended doing without them, and persuaded Charles II to keep parliament out of session with repeated prorogations.\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch war]] (begun in April 1672), however, soon forced Charles II's hand. While parliament was prorogued, the Cabal had unwisely engineered the \"[[Great Stop of the Exchequer]]\" in January 1672, redirecting the revenues designated for the paying of government debt towards financing a new fleet for the upcoming war. The default prompted the goldsmith bankers of London to cease all further credit to the crown, forcing Charles II to finally call parliament again in early 1673 for its 10th Session to plead for funds. By this time, the war was not going very well, and English public sentiment, which had originally been itching for revenge on the hated Dutch, now swung firmly against it. Facing the Anglo-French onslaught, the Dutch republic had delivered itself into the hands of the charismatic young ''stadtholder'' [[William III of Orange]], Charles's own nephew.  English public opinion (encouraged by Dutch propaganda) embraced the image of the heroic young Protestant prince valiantly defying an \"international Catholic conspiracy\" (uncomfortably close to the truth, given the secret Treaty of Dover).  The Cabal defended the war vigorously - Ashley making his famous \"[[Carthago delenda est|Delenda est Carthago]]\" speech before the House of Lords, comparing England to Rome and Holland to Carthage (an unusual classical reference for this audience). But Commons wanted to address a different item of business - the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] that had been issued by Charles II during the recess in 1672 suspending penal laws on [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Dissenters]] and [[Catholics]].  Parliament's opposition to this was not merely a spasm of religious intolerance.  The Declaration effectively suspended a parliamentary act, and the MPs were eager to emphasize the constitutional point that an act which was passed in session could only be modified, suspended or repealed in session. They also saw religion as a means to break the hated Cabal - which contained both crypto-Catholics like Arlington and Clifford and crypto-Presbyterians like Ashley and Lauderdale.  Parliament believed the Cabal had been responsible for keeping them out of session and counselling to king to govern without them. To that end, parliament used its purse-strings to force not only the repeal of the Declaration but also the passage of the first [[Test Act]] in May 1673, requiring all office-holders to deny Catholic [[transubstantiation]] and take Anglican [[eucharist|communion]].\n\nFollowing the Test Act, the members of the Cabal gradually resigned or were dismissed. Rather than submit to the Test, Clifford and, more significantly the king's own brother and heir apparent, James Duke of York, resigned their offices.  James's refusal caught the public by surprise - and signalled the prospect that Charles II might be succeeded by a Catholic king.  Through the late Summer of 1673, apprehension about James's Catholicism was the talk of the day.  When the next session opened in October 1673, Ashley (now Earl of Shaftesbury), sensing the new mood, turned up at the House of Lords to loudly denounce the proposed marriage of James of York to the Catholic princess [[Mary of Modena]]. The king angrily prorogued the session and dismissed Shaftesbury.  Around that same time, Arlington and Buckingham fell into a quarrel, in the process of which the details of the secret Treaty of Dover were leaked to parliament, provoking an alarmed parliamentary inquiry.  Arlington and Buckingham sheepishly appeared before the inquiry in January 1674, accusing each other of crafting the French alliance. His foreign policy in shambles, Charles II decided to pull England out of the controversial war.  In February, Charles II took the unprecedented step of communicating the terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty to Westminster]] to parliament before it was signed.\n\nWith the fall of the Cabal (only Lauderdale lingered on in Scotland), Charles II turned to [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Thomas Osborne (Earl of Danby)]] as his chief minister. The House of Commons, which had played a significant role in the events of 1673, was comparatively calmed by Danby's orthodox Anglican government and vigorous enforcement of the Test Act. But the drama now shifted to the House of Lords, where the dismissed Ashley-Shaftesbury, in alliance with the disgruntled Buckingham and [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|George Savile (Viscount Halifax)]] (Coventry's nephew), emerged as leader of the opposition to the government. In the House of Commons, the Country Party gained strength with the adherence of talented MPs like [[William Russell, Lord Russell|William Russell]], [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|William Cavendish]], [[Henry Powle]], [[Sir Thomas Littleton, 2nd Baronet|Thomas Littleton]] and [[John Birch (soldier)|John Birch]] and coordinated their actions in Commons closely with Shaftesbury's Lords.<ref>H. Smith Williams 1908, ''England, 1642\u20131791'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ8MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA281#v=onepage&q&f=false p.281]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.90|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury]], c. 1672\u201373.]]\nThrough the brief 12th Session of early 1674, Shaftesbury and his friends, flexing their new muscles, steered a slew of provocative bills in the House of Lords, e.g. expelling Catholics from London, forcing an oath that renounced the Pope, requiring royal family members to get parliamentary consent on marriage and how to raise their children.  Finally when Shaftesbury's clique begin considering bringing James of York on charges of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], Charles II quickly prorogued the session, preventing the session's act from being passed.  The next year's sessions of 1675 went little better: Shaftesbury led an attempt to impeach Danby, following the defeat of Danby's proposed legislation to reinforce the Test Act with a new oath forswearing any attempt to \"modify\" the Church and State.  The impeachment effort came to naught, but Danby responded to the opposition's new muscle with a strenuous effort to construct a \"Court Party\" in the House of Commons to counter the Country Party (Danby's generous bribes to MPs caused the Cavalier Parliament to also be known as the \"Pensionary Parliament\").\n\nAfter these calamitous sessions, Charles II prorogued parliament in November 1675 and kept it out of session for the next fifteen months (the \"Long Prorogation\").  When parliament resumed in February 1677, it opened with a bang. Shaftesbury (joined by Buckingham, Salisbury and Wharton), proclaimed the session illegitimate, claiming that the \"Long Prorogation\" implied that parliament was effectively dissolved and that the king must call for new elections. This prospect alarmed the House of Commons, whose members (unlike Lords) risked losing their seats.  The leaders of the Country Party in Commons believed their party would be strengthened by new elections, but were unable to persuade other members to follow suit.  While the combative lords were sent to the [[Tower of London]] for their challenge, Commons were only willing to agree that the long prorogation was probably unconstitutional, but that the session itself was not.\n\nThe session of 1677 had been called by Charles II to finance England's re-entry into the [[Franco-Dutch war]], which had been dragging on since England left in 1674, and hopefully get himself a seat at the peace table.  Parliament was inclined, provided the king joined the Dutch side.  To this end, Danby negotiated the marriage of James of York's eldest daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to the Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange in November 1677.  But parliament was unwilling to provide enough funds to raise an army.  The memoirs of the French ambassador [[Paul Barillon|Paul Barillon d'Amoncourt]] reveal extensive French communication (and bribery) of the MPs to delay supply - even Country Party leaders like [[Henry Powle]], [[William Harbord (politician)|William Harbord]] and [[Sir Thomas Littleton, 2nd Baronet|Thomas Littleton]] were paid. This has led some historians to speculate that parliament's war-call was a bluff from the start, that they were more interested in denying the king a foreign policy victory and embarrassing Danby.  Nonetheless, Charles II hurried things along in late 1677 by precipitously signing a treaty with William III to re-enter the war, and presenting it to parliament as a fait accompli.  The reluctant parliament was forced to cough up enough funds to dispatch an expeditionary force of around 15,000 troops under the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] to Flanders in May, 1678.  But it was too late - the French and Dutch quickly wound up their negotiations (without England), and went on to sign the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]] ending the war.  In June, parliament quickly voted a sum to finance the disbanding of the expeditionary force, but Charles II decided to use the money to maintain it instead for a few months longer, in the hope he might still affect the final treaty.\n\n[[image:Popish Plot Playcard1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[William Bedloe]] 'reveals' the [[Popish Plot]] to a committee of the House of Commons]]\nThis humiliating conclusion to the king's war policy dragged the political reputation of the King and Danby to a low point, making them vulnerable when the [[Popish Plot]] erupted in August and September 1678.  When the 17th session opened that October, parliament was in a tremendously combative mood. Worked up by the Popish plot, they strengthened the Test Act with the [[Papists' Disabling Act]] excluding Catholics from both houses of parliament and the king's court (James exempted). Parliament also demanded to know why the king had misapplied the June funds and was still maintaining the expeditionary force in Flanders. The session was finally wrecked when details emerged that, on Charles II's instructions, Danby had entered into secret negotiations with Louis XIV in early 1676, promising England would ''not'' re-enter the war on the Dutch side, negotiations which had not been revealed during the 1677 debate.  Parliament immediately impeached Danby, forcing Charles II to prorogue the session in December, 1678.\n\nIn the recess, Charles II entered into negotiations with Shaftesbury and other parliamentary leaders.  In return for saving Danby from trial in the House of Lords, Charles II reluctantly agreed to their demands to finally dissolve parliament and call for new elections.  The dissolution was announced on 24 January 1679, bringing the seemingly interminable Cavalier Parliament to its end.\n\nAfter the elections, the new parliament - known as the [[Habeas Corpus Parliament]] (or \"First Exclusion Parliament\") - was assembled in March, 1679.\n\n== Officers ==\n\nIn the first decade, the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]] of the House of Commons was Sir [[Edward Turnour (speaker)|Edward Turnour]] (MP for Hertford), who was elected by the first session in 1661.  Turnour become [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] in 1670 and held the speakership until 1671 (end of 9th Session), after which he was appointed the new [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].  At the opening of the 10th Session (February 1673), [[Sir Job Charlton, 1st Baronet|Job Charlton]] (MP Ludlow) was elected as the new speaker, but resigned after a month on account of ill-health.  Sir [[Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet|Edward Seymour]] (MP for Totnes and [[Treasurer of the Navy]]) replaced him, and served as Speaker until the 1678 session, when the speakership went to the Sir [[Robert Sawyer (Attorney General)|Robert Sawyer]] (MP for High Wycombe).  But Sawyer resigned within weeks, also on account of health, and Seymour stepped in again as speaker until the end of the Cavalier parliament.\n\n== Sessions ==\n\nAt the 1660 [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], the [[Interregnum (England)|Commonwealth era]] was obliterated from the legal record, with the result that Charles II's [[regnal years of English monarchs|regnal years]] officially begin on January 30, 1649 (the death date of Charles I).  The Cavalier parliament thus officially begins on the thirteenth year of Charles II's reign.\n\nThe Cavalier parliament went through seventeen sessions,<ref name = \"Cobbett\">The number of sessions are as given in Thomas Cobbett's 1809 ''Parliamentary History of England'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ma0_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false vol. IV]</ref> although some sessions were broken up by adjournments and recesses (an \"adjournment\" only interrupts a session; a \"[[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogation]]\" ends a session, a \"dissolution\" ends a parliament).\n\nBy English tradition, a parliamentary session passes only one public \"[[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|act]]\", albeit an act with various \"chapters\". English legal statutes are cited by parliamentary session labeled by the [[regnal years of English monarchs|regnal year]] in which that session sat.  So the citation \"15 Charles II c.4\" means \"the fourth chapter of the act passed by the parliamentary session that sat in the 15th year of the reign of Charles II\".  Charles II's regnal year begins January 30, so if a single parliamentary session overlaps that date, it will usually be given a double label, e.g. \"19 & 20 Charles II\" (the session that sat from the 19th to the 20th year of Charles II's reign). If there are two sessions within the same regnal year, they are differentiated by a \"Statute\" suffix (e.g.  13 Charles II Stat.1 is a different session than 13 Charles II Stat. 2). Finally, some sessions were prorogued without passing an act, and thus have no legal statute label at all.\n\nThe legal titles of parliamentary sessions of the Cavalier parliament are as given in the two most prominent compilations of statutes - the popular ''[[Statutes at Large]]'' (ed. Owen Ruffhead, 1762\u201365 or Danby Pickering 1762\u201366)<ref>Owen Ruffhead, editor, 1762\u201365, ''Statutes at Large, from Magna Charta to the Twenty-Fifth Year of George III''.  Ruffhead died before completion, and the collection was continued by Charles Runnington up to 1786.  A comparable and arguably better collection with the same title as Ruffhead, which came out at the same time, was by Danby Pickering (1762\u201366) ''Statutes at Large, from Magna Charta to the End of the Eleventh Parliament of Great Britain, Anno 1761.'' Cambridge.  The labels and numbering in Ruffhead and Pickering are identical, and so interchangeable.

This table largely follows the dating in Cobbett's ''Parliamentary History''.<ref name = \"Cobbett\"/>  (''[[Nota bene|N.B.]]'' - In the 17th century, the English \"legal year\" began on March 25, so an act which is passed, say, on February 10, 1663 will be officially dated February 10, ''1662''.  This can be a cause of confusion.  Cobbett notes the double date by a hyphen 1662\u201363, with the latter number as the historical calendar year.  The table below follows the regular calendar dates.)\n\nFor the acts of parliament passed in each session, see [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1660\u20131699]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Session\n!Label\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"|Start\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"|End\n!Note\n|-\n| 1st Session || 13 Charles II, Stat.1 || May 8, 1661 || Jun 30, 1661 || adjourned \n|-\n| 1st Session (cont'd) || 13 Cha.

It was the longest English Parliament, enduring for nearly 18 years of the quarter-century reign of [[Charles II of England]]. Like its predecessor, the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], it was overwhelmingly [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and is also known as the '''Pensioner Parliament''' for the many [[pension]]s it granted to adherents of the King.<ref>''The London Magazine'', May\u2013August 1827,Hunt and Clarke, 1827.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=3QEFAAAAQAAJ&lr=&as_brr=3&pg=PA115#v=onepage&f=false pp. 115\u2013124] \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6aNk80AR7McC&pg=PR3#v=onepage&q=&f=false Flagellum Parliamentarium]\" attributed to [[Andrew Marvell]]. A list of Members of Parliament who were receiving a state salary or pension in the early 1670s.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first session of the Cavalier Parliament opened on May 8, 1661.  Among the first orders of business was the confirmation of the acts of the previous year's irregular [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention of 1660]] as legitimate (notably, the [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]]).  Parliament immediately ordered the public burning of the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] by a common hangman.<ref>Cobbett, ''Parliamentary History'', Vol. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ma0_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT140#v=onepage&q&f=false 208-09]</ref>  It also [[Clergy Act 1661|repealed]] the 1642 [[Bishops Exclusion Act]], thereby allowing [[Church of England]] bishops to resume their temporal positions, including their seats in the [[House of Lords]].  Other notable pieces of first session legislation include the [[The King's Sole Right over the Militia Act 1661|Militia Act]] placing the armed forces unambiguously under the king's authority, and the [[Sedition Act 1661|Sedition Act]]. It also continued proceedings against the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides of Charles I]].\n\nLater that same year (1661), Parliament passed the [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Act]], the first of a series of acts known as the [[Clarendon Code]], to cement the episcopal Anglican church as the official church of England.  The Clarendon code is normally given as the following four acts:\n* the [[Corporation Act 1661]]\n* the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]]\n* the [[Conventicle Act 1664]]\n* the [[Five Mile Act 1665]].\n\nThe [[Quaker Act 1662]], specifically targeting [[Quakers]], can also be cited as part of the new religious 'code'. In January 1661, the [[Fifth Monarchists]], anticipating the arrival of [[Jesus Christ]] to claim the throne, led a succession of revolts under the command of [[Vavasor Powell]] and [[Thomas Venner]]. To silence radical agitators and pamphleteers, Parliament passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]], instituting government censorship of the press.\n\nOn the economic legislation, the Cavalier parliament had a notable [[Mercantilist]] bent.  To promote the English cloth industry, it outlawed the exportation of raw materials, such as [[wool]], [[hide (skin)|raw hides]] and [[fuller's earth|fuller's clay]] (1662) and forbade the importation of finished materials like [[lace]] and [[embroidery]] (1662). It repealed old domestic restrictions on [[linen]] manufacturing (1663).  To encourage the development of the [[British America|American colonies]] as raw-material producers and consumers of English manufactured goods, the Cavalier parliament confirmed and reinforced the [[Navigation Act]] passed by the prior parliament in 1660, with the new [[Staple Act 1663|Staple Act]] in 1663, requiring foreigners trading with the American colonies to transship their goods through English ports.  Old [[corn laws]] were adjusted to the advantage of English farmers: the old restrictions on the exportation of wheat was gradually relaxed, exportation becoming fully free in 1670 and even subsidized with [[export subsidy|bounties]] after 1673. Conversely, the importation of wheat was restricted, with the first [[protectionism|prohibitive tariffs]] on the importation of grains introduced in 1663 in a two-tier system, adjusted (1670) into a three-tier system based on current price.  The [[Importation Act 1667|importation of Irish cattle]] into Britain was forbidden (1666), giving English beef producers a protected home market (in trade, Scotland was already excluded altogether, treated as a foreign country on par with France).  To facilitate the overseas operations of the [[chartered company|charter companies]], parliament inserted a clause into the 1663 Staple Act allowing the free exportation of [[precious metal|coin and bullion]] - over the vigorous opposition of [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey|Arthur Annesley (Earl Anglesey)]], the leading mercantilist in parliament. To encourage the inflow of gold and silver from abroad and into circulation, the [[Coinage Act 1666]] abolished [[seignorage]], and introduced free minting at the [[Royal Mint]].\n\nThe prior [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention of 1660]] had promised King Charles II a generous annual revenue of \u00a31.2 million, secured on [[customs duties]] and [[excise tax]]es.  It was up to Cavalier parliament to ensure that the promise was kept.  But in the first few years, the revenue fell short of the promised amount, and parliament had to look for new ways to make up for it.  Parliament was responsible for the introduction of the controversial [[hearth tax]] (1662), with its unpopular and intrusive method of assessment (tax collectors had to go inside everyone's private homes to count [[hearth]]s). Another problem also emerged at this time: the sudden rise in the number of [[pauper]]s, which had catapulted with the demobilization of the army.  It was feared they would migrate ''en masse'' to the better-off [[parish]]es and swamp their social assistance programs.  So, in another controversial piece of legislation, parliament changed the Elizabethan [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]] with the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Act of Settlement and Removal]] (1662), legally restricting the poor to seeking assistance in their own home parish.\n\nOther significant and curious pieces of early legislation include the first licensing of [[hackney carriage]]s (1662), an act against \"excessive gaming\" (1663) and a famous 1663 act authorizing the erection of [[toll road|toll gates]] on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], the prelude to a series of acts to help finance road-building for highways. \n[[Image:Verschuier-fire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Great Fire of London]].]]\n\nIn 1664, the Cavalier parliament amended the old [[Triennial Act]] so that it was now only suggested (rather than required) that the king summon a parliamentary session at least once every three years. In 1665, parliament met in [[Oxford]] to escape the [[Great Plague of London]]. The next year, in the aftermath of the [[Great Fire of London]] which ravaged the city in September 1666, parliament set up a court to settle disputes between landlords and tenants of burned buildings ([[Fire of London Disputes Act 1666]]), and passed a series of acts setting down regulations for rebuilding of the city ([[Rebuilding of London Act 1666]]).\n\nMercantilist agitation had prompted parliament to support the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1665. But when the war turned out poorly in 1667, parliament decided to lay the blame on Charles II's chief minister [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde (Earl of Clarendon)]] and the king's brother and lord admiral, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]].  Parliament, echoing public belief, accused that the money voted for the war had been embezzled by court officers.  Under pressure, Charles consented to setting up an independent commission for inquiry, but the verdict was inconclusive. Nonetheless, parliament decided to launch impeachment proceedings against Clarendon. Before these bore fruit, Clarendon went into exile.\n\nClarendon's departure opened the way for the rise of a new crop of young ministers, known as \"the [[Cabal Ministry|Cabal]]\", a loose ministerial coalition consisting of [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Arlington]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Ashley]], [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lauderdale]].  The beginnings of what is now called a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] system began to emerge within the government. Sir [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]], who had long stressed parliamentary prerogative in tying expenditures to specific sources (rather than just voting for supply and letting the crown allocate as it saw fit), became secretary to the Treasury, and helped overhaul crown finances, finally putting them on a steady course.\n\nNonetheless, parliament was shocked when, in 1668, the Cabal announced the \"[[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]\", which brought England into alliance with her recent enemy, the [[Dutch Republic]]. Although a league of northern Protestant powers had some appeal, mercantilist sentiment in parliament was still very strong, and the Netherlands was still seen as the main threat to England.  Disillusioned by the lukewarm reception, Charles II re-oriented his foreign policy and struck up the notorious secret [[Treaty of Dover]] in May 1670, allying England and [[Louis XIV]]'s France, in a plan to dismember the Netherlands.\n\nDespite their comparative energy and efficiency, the Cabal was a fractious and unpopular lot and their infighting spilled over publicly into parliament, particularly the [[House of Lords]].  At this stage, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] was ''de facto'' subservient to Lords, \"managed from above\" by the Lords' handlers, following their lead and echoing their quarrels. But Commons soon began to find its own voice. Finding the Cabal insufferable, Sir [[William Coventry]] resigned as Secretary to the Admiralty and went back to the House of Commons, where he emerged in 1669 as the formidable leader of a group of parliamentarians known as the \"Country Party\" - a group of MPs held together by their suspicion of corruption in high places, suspicious of the king's dubious foreign policy and, increasingly, suspicious of his loyalty to Protestantism.  The factions of a \"party political\" system thus gradually emerged in parliament, polarised between the Coventry-led \"Country Party\" (ancestral to the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]]) and the \"Court Party\" (supporters of the king's council, ancestral to the [[Tories]]).\n\nThe new self-assurance of Commons was felt in a quarrel that erupted during the 9th Session in 1670 between Lords and Commons, where Commons assailed the Lords' assumption that they had the right to amend their revenue bills. Finding their handlers could no longer control Commons, and that the goodwill that had attended Charles II at the Restoration was wearing thin, the Cabal recommended doing without them, and persuaded Charles II to keep parliament out of session with repeated prorogations.\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch war]] (begun in April 1672), however, soon forced Charles II's hand. While parliament was prorogued, the Cabal had unwisely engineered the \"[[Great Stop of the Exchequer]]\" in January 1672, redirecting the revenues designated for the paying of government debt towards financing a new fleet for the upcoming war. The default prompted the goldsmith bankers of London to cease all further credit to the crown, forcing Charles II to finally call parliament again in early 1673 for its 10th Session to plead for funds. By this time, the war was not going very well, and English public sentiment, which had originally been itching for revenge on the hated Dutch, now swung firmly against it. Facing the Anglo-French onslaught, the Dutch republic had delivered itself into the hands of the charismatic young ''stadtholder'' [[William III of Orange]], Charles's own nephew.  English public opinion (encouraged by Dutch propaganda) embraced the image of the heroic young Protestant prince valiantly defying an \"international Catholic conspiracy\" (uncomfortably close to the truth, given the secret Treaty of Dover).  The Cabal defended the war vigorously - Ashley making his famous \"[[Carthago delenda est|Delenda est Carthago]]\" speech before the House of Lords, comparing England to Rome and Holland to Carthage (an unusual classical reference for this audience). But Commons wanted to address a different item of business - the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] that had been issued by Charles II during the recess in 1672 suspending penal laws on [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Dissenters]] and [[Catholics]].  Parliament's opposition to this was not merely a spasm of religious intolerance.  The Declaration effectively suspended a parliamentary act, and the MPs were eager to emphasize the constitutional point that an act which was passed in session could only be modified, suspended or repealed in session. They also saw religion as a means to break the hated Cabal - which contained both crypto-Catholics like Arlington and Clifford and crypto-Presbyterians like Ashley and Lauderdale.  Parliament believed the Cabal had been responsible for keeping them out of session and counselling to king to govern without them. To that end, parliament used its purse-strings to force not only the repeal of the Declaration but also the passage of the first [[Test Act]] in May 1673, requiring all office-holders to deny Catholic [[transubstantiation]] and take Anglican [[eucharist|communion]].\n\nFollowing the Test Act, the members of the Cabal gradually resigned or were dismissed. Rather than submit to the Test, Clifford and, more significantly the king's own brother and heir apparent, James Duke of York, resigned their offices.  James's refusal caught the public by surprise - and signalled the prospect that Charles II might be succeeded by a Catholic king.  Through the late Summer of 1673, apprehension about James's Catholicism was the talk of the day.  When the next session opened in October 1673, Ashley (now Earl of Shaftesbury), sensing the new mood, turned up at the House of Lords to loudly denounce the proposed marriage of James of York to the Catholic princess [[Mary of Modena]]. The king angrily prorogued the session and dismissed Shaftesbury.  Around that same time, Arlington and Buckingham fell into a quarrel, in the process of which the details of the secret Treaty of Dover were leaked to parliament, provoking an alarmed parliamentary inquiry.  Arlington and Buckingham sheepishly appeared before the inquiry in January 1674, accusing each other of crafting the French alliance. His foreign policy in shambles, Charles II decided to pull England out of the controversial war.  In February, Charles II took the unprecedented step of communicating the terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty to Westminster]] to parliament before it was signed.\n\nWith the fall of the Cabal (only Lauderdale lingered on in Scotland), Charles II turned to [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Thomas Osborne (Earl of Danby)]] as his chief minister. The House of Commons, which had played a significant role in the events of 1673, was comparatively calmed by Danby's orthodox Anglican government and vigorous enforcement of the Test Act. But the drama now shifted to the House of Lords, where the dismissed Ashley-Shaftesbury, in alliance with the disgruntled Buckingham and [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|George Savile (Viscount Halifax)]] (Coventry's nephew), emerged as leader of the opposition to the government. In the House of Commons, the Country Party gained strength with the adherence of talented MPs like [[William Russell, Lord Russell|William Russell]], [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|William Cavendish]], [[Henry Powle]], [[Sir Thomas Littleton, 2nd Baronet|Thomas Littleton]] and [[John Birch (soldier)|John Birch]] and coordinated their actions in Commons closely with Shaftesbury's Lords.<ref>H. Smith Williams 1908, ''England, 1642\u20131791'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ8MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA281#v=onepage&q&f=false p.281]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.90|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury]], c. 1672\u201373.]]\nThrough the brief 12th Session of early 1674, Shaftesbury and his friends, flexing their new muscles, steered a slew of provocative bills in the House of Lords, e.g. expelling Catholics from London, forcing an oath that renounced the Pope, requiring royal family members to get parliamentary consent on marriage and how to raise their children.  Finally when Shaftesbury's clique begin considering bringing James of York on charges of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], Charles II quickly prorogued the session, preventing the session's act from being passed.  The next year's sessions of 1675 went little better: Shaftesbury led an attempt to impeach Danby, following the defeat of Danby's proposed legislation to reinforce the Test Act with a new oath forswearing any attempt to \"modify\" the Church and State.  The impeachment effort came to naught, but Danby responded to the opposition's new muscle with a strenuous effort to construct a \"Court Party\" in the House of Commons to counter the Country Party (Danby's generous bribes to MPs caused the Cavalier Parliament to also be known as the \"Pensionary Parliament\").\n\nAfter these calamitous sessions, Charles II prorogued parliament in November 1675 and kept it out of session for the next fifteen months (the \"Long Prorogation\").  When parliament resumed in February 1677, it opened with a bang. Shaftesbury (joined by Buckingham, Salisbury and Wharton), proclaimed the session illegitimate, claiming that the \"Long Prorogation\" implied that parliament was effectively dissolved and that the king must call for new elections. This prospect alarmed the House of Commons, whose members (unlike Lords) risked losing their seats.  The leaders of the Country Party in Commons believed their party would be strengthened by new elections, but were unable to persuade other members to follow suit.  While the combative lords were sent to the [[Tower of London]] for their challenge, Commons were only willing to agree that the long prorogation was probably unconstitutional, but that the session itself was not.\n\nThe session of 1677 had been called by Charles II to finance England's re-entry into the [[Franco-Dutch war]], which had been dragging on since England left in 1674, and hopefully get himself a seat at the peace table.  Parliament was inclined, provided the king joined the Dutch side.  To this end, Danby negotiated the marriage of James of York's eldest daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to the Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange in November 1677.  But parliament was unwilling to provide enough funds to raise an army.  The memoirs of the French ambassador [[Paul Barillon|Paul Barillon d'Amoncourt]] reveal extensive French communication (and bribery) of the MPs to delay supply - even Country Party leaders like [[Henry Powle]], [[William Harbord (politician)|William Harbord]] and [[Sir Thomas Littleton, 2nd Baronet|Thomas Littleton]] were paid. This has led some historians to speculate that parliament's war-call was a bluff from the start, that they were more interested in denying the king a foreign policy victory and embarrassing Danby.  Nonetheless, Charles II hurried things along in late 1677 by precipitously signing a treaty with William III to re-enter the war, and presenting it to parliament as a fait accompli.  The reluctant parliament was forced to cough up enough funds to dispatch an expeditionary force of around 15,000 troops under the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] to Flanders in May, 1678.  But it was too late - the French and Dutch quickly wound up their negotiations (without England), and went on to sign the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]] ending the war.  In June, parliament quickly voted a sum to finance the disbanding of the expeditionary force, but Charles II decided to use the money to maintain it instead for a few months longer, in the hope he might still affect the final treaty.\n\n[[image:Popish Plot Playcard1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[William Bedloe]] 'reveals' the [[Popish Plot]] to a committee of the House of Commons]]\nThis humiliating conclusion to the king's war policy dragged the political reputation of the King and Danby to a low point, making them vulnerable when the [[Popish Plot]] erupted in August and September 1678.  When the 17th session opened that October, parliament was in a tremendously combative mood. Worked up by the Popish plot, they strengthened the Test Act with the [[Papists' Disabling Act]] excluding Catholics from both houses of parliament and the king's court (James exempted). Parliament also demanded to know why the king had misapplied the June funds and was still maintaining the expeditionary force in Flanders. The session was finally wrecked when details emerged that, on Charles II's instructions, Danby had entered into secret negotiations with Louis XIV in early 1676, promising England would ''not'' re-enter the war on the Dutch side, negotiations which had not been revealed during the 1677 debate.  Parliament immediately impeached Danby, forcing Charles II to prorogue the session in December, 1678.\n\nIn the recess, Charles II entered into negotiations with Shaftesbury and other parliamentary leaders.  In return for saving Danby from trial in the House of Lords, Charles II reluctantly agreed to their demands to finally dissolve parliament and call for new elections.  The dissolution was announced on 24 January 1679, bringing the seemingly interminable Cavalier Parliament to its end.\n\nAfter the elections, the new parliament - known as the [[Habeas Corpus Parliament]] (or \"First Exclusion Parliament\") - was assembled in March, 1679.\n\n== Officers ==\n\nIn the first decade, the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]] of the House of Commons was Sir [[Edward Turnour (speaker)|Edward Turnour]] (MP for Hertford), who was elected by the first session in 1661.  Turnour become [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] in 1670 and held the speakership until 1671 (end of 9th Session), after which he was appointed the new [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].  At the opening of the 10th Session (February 1673), [[Sir Job Charlton, 1st Baronet|Job Charlton]] (MP Ludlow) was elected as the new speaker, but resigned after a month on account of ill-health.  Sir [[Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet|Edward Seymour]] (MP for Totnes and [[Treasurer of the Navy]]) replaced him, and served as Speaker until the 1678 session, when the speakership went to the Sir [[Robert Sawyer (Attorney General)|Robert Sawyer]] (MP for High Wycombe).  But Sawyer resigned within weeks, also on account of health, and Seymour stepped in again as speaker until the end of the Cavalier parliament.\n\n== Sessions ==\n\nAt the 1660 [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], the [[Interregnum (England)|Commonwealth era]] was obliterated from the legal record, with the result that Charles II's [[regnal years of English monarchs|regnal years]] officially begin on January 30, 1649 (the death date of Charles I).  The Cavalier parliament thus officially begins on the thirteenth year of Charles II's reign.\n\nThe Cavalier parliament went through seventeen sessions,<ref name = \"Cobbett\">The number of sessions are as given in Thomas Cobbett's 1809 ''Parliamentary History of England'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ma0_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false vol. IV]</ref> although some sessions were broken up by adjournments and recesses (an \"adjournment\" only interrupts a session; a \"[[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogation]]\" ends a session, a \"dissolution\" ends a parliament).\n\nBy English tradition, a parliamentary session passes only one public \"[[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|act]]\", albeit an act with various \"chapters\". English legal statutes are cited by parliamentary session labeled by the [[regnal years of English monarchs|regnal year]] in which that session sat.  So the citation \"15 Charles II c.4\" means \"the fourth chapter of the act passed by the parliamentary session that sat in the 15th year of the reign of Charles II\".  Charles II's regnal year begins January 30, so if a single parliamentary session overlaps that date, it will usually be given a double label, e.g. \"19 & 20 Charles II\" (the session that sat from the 19th to the 20th year of Charles II's reign). If there are two sessions within the same regnal year, they are differentiated by a \"Statute\" suffix (e.g.  13 Charles II Stat.1 is a different session than 13 Charles II Stat. 2). Finally, some sessions were prorogued without passing an act, and thus have no legal statute label at all.\n\nThe legal titles of parliamentary sessions of the Cavalier parliament are as given in the two most prominent compilations of statutes - the popular ''[[Statutes at Large]]'' (ed. Owen Ruffhead, 1762\u201365 or Danby Pickering 1762\u201366)<ref>Owen Ruffhead, editor, 1762\u201365, ''Statutes at Large, from Magna Charta to the Twenty-Fifth Year of George III''.  Ruffhead died before completion, and the collection was continued by Charles Runnington up to 1786.  A comparable and arguably better collection with the same title as Ruffhead, which came out at the same time, was by Danby Pickering (1762\u201366) ''Statutes at Large, from Magna Charta to the End of the Eleventh Parliament of Great Britain, Anno 1761.'' Cambridge.  The labels and numbering in Ruffhead and Pickering are identical, and so interchangeable.  The Cavalier Parliament is covered in Pickering's [https://books.google.com/books?id=cucuAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP9#v=onepage&q&f=false volume 8] (see also his [https://books.google.com/books?id=ma0_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT832#v=onepage&q&f=false table of acts]).</ref> and the official ''[[The Statutes of the Realm]]'' (ed. John Raithby, 1819).<ref>The Cavalier parliament is covered in ''Statutes of the Realm'', [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=351&page=1&sort=1 vol. 5].</ref>  We note where the title differs between the two compilations.<ref name = variances>''Chronological Table and Index of the Statutes'', 2nd. ed. 1873: [https://books.google.com/books?id=qLcKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false table] of variances between ''Statutes of Realm'' and Ruffhead-Pickering ''Statutes at Large''.  Briefly summarized:\n* 14 Cha. II (''S of Realm'') = 13 & 14 Cha. II (''S at Large'') = First session, third sitting (1662)\n* 18 & 19 Cha. II (cc.1\u20135) = 18 Cha.

II (cc.1\u20138) = Seventh Session, second sitting (1668)\n</ref>\n\nThe session dates are sometimes incorrect in the rolls.  This table largely follows the dating in Cobbett's ''Parliamentary History''.<ref name = \"Cobbett\"/>  (''[[Nota bene|N.B.]]'' - In the 17th century, the English \"legal year\" began on March 25, so an act which is passed, say, on February 10, 1663 will be officially dated February 10, ''1662''.  This can be a cause of confusion.  Cobbett notes the double date by a hyphen 1662\u201363, with the latter number as the historical calendar year.  The table below follows the regular calendar dates.)\n\nFor the acts of parliament passed in each session, see [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1660\u20131699]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Session\n!Label\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"|Start\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"|End\n!Note\n|-\n| 1st Session || 13 Charles II, Stat.1 || May 8, 1661 || Jun 30, 1661 || adjourned \n|-\n| 1st Session (cont'd) || 13 Cha.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{USD}}80 million.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[Japanese role-playing game]]s worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an upcoming [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]].

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans. Square subsequently stated that it would never allow Sony to localize the game in any way.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Colin|last=Campbell|title=Final Fantasy Mania |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997|page=30}}</ref> In addition to translating the text, the North American localization team made tweaks to the gameplay, including reducing the enemy encounter rate, simplifying the Materia menu, and adding new boss fights.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Bro Buzz|title=Final Fantasy VII Update! |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=107|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=August 1997|page=86}}</ref>\n\n===Later releases===\nThe ''International'' version of ''Final Fantasy VII'' was released on [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) as a PSOne Classic in Japan on April 10, 2009.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{USD}}80 million.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[Japanese role-playing game]]s worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an upcoming [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable.

Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''.

This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including ''Final Fantasy VI'' had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

\"dismantles the idea of revenge in an insightful way.\" He considers Barrett's story to be the clearest illustration of the game's \"tragic survivorship\" theme, such as the loss of his [[coal
