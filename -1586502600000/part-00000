Jeff, owner of the town's gas station, is on a picnic with wholesome local girl Ann Miller. Stefanos sends Jeff's deaf young employee, The Kid, to retrieve Jeff, then informs Jeff that Whit Sterling wants to see him.  Though Ann trusts Jeff implicitly, her parents are wary of him, as is Jim, a local police officer who has been sweet on Ann since childhood. Jeff reluctantly agrees to meet with Whit, and Ann joins him to drive through the night to Whit's home on [[Lake Tahoe]]. On the way, Jeff tells Ann of his past (in flashback).\n\nJeff Bailey's real name is Jeff Markham. Partner Jack Fisher and he were [[private investigator]]s in New York. Jeff had been hired by shady businessman Whit to find his girlfriend, Kathie Moffat. Whit claimed she shot him and stole $40,000 from him. Jeff is hesitant, sensing that finding Kathie will result in her death. Whit assures Jeff he just wants her back, and will not harm her.\n\nKathie's maid tells Jeff that she has gone to [[Florida]], but Jeff guesses [[Mexico]] because of the particular inoculations Kathie received. He goes to [[Acapulco]] and waits, eventually striking up an acquaintance with her. A [[Romance (love)|love affair]] develops, and Jeff ultimately admits that he had been sent by Whit. Kathie sensed this from the start and has been spinning a web for him. She denies taking Whit\u2019s money and pleads with Jeff to run away with her.\n\nPreparing to leave, Jeff is surprised by the arrival of Whit and Stefanos, checking up on his lack of progress. Jeff asks to be taken off the case, but Whit refuses. Jeff lies that Kathie slipped past him and is on a steamer going south. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her; instead, Jeff takes her north to [[San Francisco]].\n\nThey live in San Francisco as inconspicuously as possible, but an outing to the [[horse racing|horse races]] goes bad when they are spotted by Jeff\u2019s old partner, Fisher. Jeff and Kathie split up, with Jeff making himself conspicuous in moving to [[Los Angeles]]. Jeff seems to give Fisher the slip and eventually rejoins Kathie at a rural cabin, only to find that Fisher had actually followed her. When Fisher demands money to keep quiet, the two men brawl. Kathie suddenly shoots Fisher dead and flees without Jeff.  He finds her bank book, revealing a deposit of $40,000, the money she had denied taking from Whit.\n\n[[File:Out of The Past 1947.JPG|thumb|right|Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer in ''Out of the Past'']]\nBack in the present, Ann drops Jeff off at Whit's palatial estate. Jeff is surprised when Kathie reappears. She had returned to Whit and told the whole story. Whit tells Jeff that doing one last job is the only way to make things right between them. Whit's lawyer, Leonard Eels, has helped Whit dodge all taxes, but now wants $200,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.2|1947|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) or he will give Whit's business records to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], which would put Whit in prison. Whit wants Jeff to recover the records, but Jeff realizes that he is being set up.\n\nIn San Francisco, he meets Eels' secretary, Meta Carson, who is secretly conspiring with Whit. He is introduced by her to Eels, leaving his fingerprints on a glass. Jeff returns and finds Eels dead. He hides the body and retrieves the business records, but is told by the devious Kathie (who has impersonated Meta Carson) that she gave Whit a signed [[affidavit]] swearing that Jeff killed Fisher, setting up Jeff to be a double murderer&mdash;reported as such in the morning papers.\n\nJeff returns to the Bridgeport area.  Unbeknownst to Whit, Kathie has ordered Stefanos to trail The Kid so he can find and kill Jeff. The Kid drives to a steep, narrow canyon where Jeff is hiding. The Kid spots Stefanos aiming a pistol at Jeff and quickly hooks him with a fishing line, causing Stefanos to lose his balance and fall to his death.\n\nJeff goes back to Whit's mansion and tells him of Kathie's double-cross and Stefanos's death. He offers that the death of Stefanos, Eels' actual murderer, can be made to look like a guilt-ridden suicide, removing Jeff from that frame-up. Furthermore, he will return the business records to Whit if Whit destroys Kathie's affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fisher's death. Whit takes the offer, and Jeff believes he has worked his way out of the trap.\n\nJeff makes a quick visit to Ann, then returns to Tahoe to discover that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives Jeff the choice of running away with her and a satchel of Whit's money, or taking the blame for all three murders.  He agrees to go with her, but phones the state police while she is upstairs packing. Driving up to a police [[roadblock]], Kathie realizes that Jeff has betrayed her and shoots him dead. She then fires at the police, who fatally shoot her.\n\nWhen the news reaches Bridgeport, Jim offers to take Ann away. Ann asks The Kid if Jeff had been planning to run away with Kathie. Wanting to free Ann, The Kid lies and nods his head. Ann returns to Jim and she drives off with him, as The Kid smiles and salutes Jeff's name on the station's sign.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as Jeff Bailey, previously known as Jeff Markham\n* [[Jane Greer]] as Kathie Moffat\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Whit Sterling\n* [[Rhonda Fleming]] as Meta Carson\n* [[Richard Webb (actor)|Richard Webb]] as Jim\n* [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]] as Jack Fisher\n* [[Virginia Huston]] as Ann Miller\n* [[Paul Valentine]] as Joe Stefanos\n* [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] as The Kid\n* [[Ken Niles]] as Leonard Eels\n* [[Theresa Harris]] as Eunice Leonard\n\n==Background and production==\n''Out of the Past'' was produced by [[RKO Pictures]], and the key personnel \u2014 director [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[cinematographer]] [[Nicholas Musuraca]], actors Mitchum and Greer, along with [[Albert S.

The film stars Robert Mitchum, whose weary eyes and laconic voice, whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference, made him an archetypal noir actor. The story opens before we've even seen him, as trouble comes to town looking for him. A man from his past has seen him pumping gas, and now his old life reaches out and pulls him back.\"<ref name=ebert/> Ebert also called it, \"The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time.\"<ref name=\"ebert200\">Ebert, Roger - [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990226/REVIEWS/902260301/1023 200 Cigarettes] Chicago Sun, February 26, 1999.

Rhonda Fleming is in briefly but effectively.\"<ref name=variety/>\n\nIn a 2004 review of the film, critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote \"''Out of the Past'' is one of the greatest of all film noirs, the story of a man who tries to break with his past and his weakness and start over again in a town, with a new job and a new girl. The film stars Robert Mitchum, whose weary eyes and laconic voice, whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference, made him an archetypal noir actor. The story opens before we've even seen him, as trouble comes to town looking for him. A man from his past has seen him pumping gas, and now his old life reaches out and pulls him back.\"<ref name=ebert/> Ebert also called it, \"The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time.\"<ref name=\"ebert200\">Ebert, Roger - [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990226/REVIEWS/902260301/1023 200 Cigarettes] Chicago Sun, February 26, 1999. This review also later appeared in the book by Roger Ebert, \"I Hated Hated Hated HATED this movie\"</ref>  \"The trick, as demonstrated by Jacques Tourneur and his cameraman, Nicholas Musuraca, is to throw a lot of light into the empty space where the characters are going to exhale.

{"title_page": "DNA paternity testing", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|DNA matching techniques to identify someone's father}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n\n'''DNA paternity testing''' is the use of [[DNA profiling|DNA profiles]] to determine whether an individual is the [[biology|biological]] parent of another individual. Paternity testing can be especially important when the rights and duties of the father are in issue and a child's [[Father|paternity]] is in doubt. Tests can also determine the likelihood of someone being a biological grandparent. Though [[genetics|genetic]] testing is the most reliable standard, older methods also exist, including [[blood type|ABO blood group typing]], analysis of various other [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s, or using [[human leukocyte antigen]] [[antigen]]s. The current techniques for paternity testing are using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP). Paternity testing can now also be performed while the woman is still pregnant from a blood draw.<ref>[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1113044 \"A Non-invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy\" New England Journal of Medicine May 3, 2012]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html|title=Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=19 June 2012|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nDNA testing is currently the most advanced and accurate technology to determine parentage. In a DNA paternity test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bioforensics.com/conference/Paternity/|title=Paternity Indices|date=19 April 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040419145247/http://www.bioforensics.com/conference/Paternity/|archivedate=19 April 2004}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=November 2014}} is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child, and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as \"[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]\", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693|title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|date=2006-08-15|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Paternity or maternity testing for child or adult==\nThe DNA test is performed by collecting buccal (cheek) cells found on the inside of a person's cheek using a buccal or cheek [[Cotton swab|swab]]. These swabs have wooden or plastic stick handles with a cotton on synthetic tip. The collector rubs the inside of a person's cheek to collect as many buccal cells as possible, which are then sent to a laboratory for testing. Samples from the alleged father or mother and the child would be needed.\n\n==Prenatal paternity testing for unborn child==\n\n===Invasive prenatal paternity testing===\nIt is possible to determine who the biological father of the fetus is while the woman is still pregnant through procedures called [[chorionic villus sampling]] or [[amniocentesis]]. Chorionic villus sampling retrieves placental tissue in either a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother's abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, there is a small risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result. Both CVS and Amnio require the pregnant woman to visit a genetic specialist known as a maternal fetal medicine specialist who will perform the procedure.\n\n===Non-invasive prenatal paternity testing===\nAdvances in genetic testing have led to the ability to identify the biological father while the woman is still pregnant. There is a small amount of fetal DNA ([[cffDNA]]) present in the mother's blood during pregnancy. This allows for accurate fetal DNA paternity testing during pregnancy from a blood draw with no risk of miscarriage. Studies have shown that cffDNA can first be observed as early as 7 weeks gestation, and the amount of cffDNA increases as the pregnancy progresses.<ref>{{cite journal|title=\"The New England Journal of Medicine \"A Non-invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy\" May 3, 2012|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=366|issue=18|pages=1743\u20131745|publisher=The New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1113044|pmid=22551147|year=2012|last1=Guo|first1=Xin|last2=Bayliss|first2=Philip|last3=Damewood|first3=Marian|last4=Varney|first4=John|last5=Ma|first5=Emily|last6=Vallecillo|first6=Brett|last7=Dhallan|first7=Ravinder}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html?pagewanted=all&_moc.semityn.www/|title=The New York Times \"Before Birth, Dad's I.D.\" June 20, 2012|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==DNA profiling==\n[[File:DNA paternity testing en.svg|thumb|Example of DNA profiling in order to determine the father of a child (Ch).

[[Sexual reproduction]] brings the DNA of both parents together to create a unique combination of genetic material in a new cell, so the genetic material of an individual is derived from the genetic material of each parent in equal amounts; this genetic material is known as the nuclear [[genome]] of the individual, because it is found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].\n\nComparing the DNA sequence of one person to that of another can prove if one of them was derived from the other, but DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate. Specific sequences are examined to see if they were copied verbatim from one individual's genome; if so, then the genetic material of one individual could have been derived from that of the other (i.e. one is the parent of the other). Besides nuclear DNA, [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] also have their own genetic material called [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, without any shuffling.\n\nProving a relationship based on comparison of the mitochondrial genome is much easier than that based on the nuclear genome. However, testing the mitochondrial genome can prove only if two individuals are related by [[common descent]] through maternal lines only from a common ancestor and is, thus, of limited value (i.e., it could not be used to test for paternity).\n\nIn testing the paternity of a male child, comparison of the [[Y chromosome]] can be used, since it is passed directly from father to son.\n\nIn the US, the [[AABB]] has regulations for DNA paternity and family relationship testing, but AABB accreditation is not required. DNA test results are legally admissible if the collection and the processing follows a chain of custody. Similarly in Canada, the SCC has regulations on DNA paternity and relationship testing, but this accreditation, while recommended, is not required.\n\nThe Paternity Testing Commission of the [[International Society for Forensic Genetics]] has taken up the task of establishing the biostatistical recommendations in accordance with the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] standards.<ref name=\"GjertsonBrenner2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Gjertson|first1=David W.|last2=Brenner|first2=Charles H.|last3=Baur|first3=Max P.|last4=Carracedo|first4=Angel|last5=Guidet|first5=Francois|last6=Luque|first6=Juan A.|last7=Lessig|first7=R\u00fcdiger|last8=Mayr|first8=Wolfgang R.|last9=Pascali|first9=Vince L.|last10=Prinz|first10=Mechthild|last11=Schneider|first11=Peter M.|last12=Morling|first12=Niels|title=ISFG: Recommendations on biostatistics in paternity testing|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=1|issue=3\u20134|year=2007|pages=223\u2013231|issn=1872-4973|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2007.06.006|pmid=19083766}}</ref> Bio-statistical evaluations of paternity should be based on a likelihood ratio principle - yielding the [[Paternity Index]], PI. The recommendations provide guidance on concepts of genetic hypotheses and calculation concerns needed to produce valid PIs, as well as on specific issues related to [[population genetics]].\n\n==History==\nThe first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching [[blood type]]s between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent under this form of testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnacenter.com/science-technology/dna-history-1920.html|title=History of DNA Testing - DNA Diagnostics Center}}</ref> In the 1930s, [[serology|serological]] testing, which tests certain proteins in the blood, became available, with a 40% exclusion rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnacenter.com/science-technology/dna-history-1930.html|title=History of DNA Testing - DNA Diagnostics Center}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, highly accurate genetic paternity testing became a possibility when [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] typing was developed, which compares the genetic fingerprints on white blood cells between the child and alleged parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19771223&id=AAkdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7Z4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6700,5859572|title=The Tuscaloosa News - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> HLA tests could be done with 80% accuracy but could not distinguish between close relatives.<ref name=answers>{{cite web|url=http://www.paternity-answers.com/history-paternity-test.html|title=Paternity Testing Resources|date=19 November 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119070715/http://www.paternity-answers.com/history-paternity-test.html|archivedate=19 November 2004}}</ref> Genetic parental testing technology advanced further with the isolation of the first [[restriction enzyme]] in 1970.

To satisfy the chain-of-custody legal requirements, all tested parties have to be properly identified and their specimens collected by a third-party professional who is not related to any of the tested parties and has no interest in the outcome of the test.\n\nThe [[Legal burden of proof|quantum of evidence]] needed is [[clear and convincing evidence]]: that is, more evidence than an ordinary case in [[civil litigation]], but less than beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] required to convict a defendant in a criminal case.\n\nIn recent years, immigration authorities in various countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and others, may accept DNA parentage test results from immigration petitioners and beneficiaries in a family-based immigration case when primary documents that prove biological relationship are missing or inadequate.\n\nIn the U.S., immigration applicants bear the responsibility of arranging and paying for DNA testing. The U.S. immigration authorities require that the DNA test, if pursued, be performed by one of the laboratories accredited by the [[AABB]] (formerly American Association of Blood Banks). Similarly, in Canada, the lab needs to be accredited by the SCC.\n\nAlthough paternity tests are more common than maternity tests, there may be circumstances in which the biological mother of the child is unclear. Examples include cases of an [[Adoption|adopted]] child attempting to reunify with his or her biological mother, potential [[Babies switched at birth|hospital mix-ups]], and [[in vitro fertilization]] where the laboratory may have implanted an unrelated embryo inside the mother.\n\nOther factors, such as new laws regarding reproductive technologies using donated eggs and sperm and surrogate mothers, can mean that the female giving birth is not necessarily the legal mother of the child. For example, in Canada, the federal ''Human Assisted Reproduction Act'' provides for the use of hired surrogate mothers. The legal mother of the child may be the egg donor. Similar laws are in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nIn Brazil in 2019, two male identical twins were ordered to both pay maintenance for a child fathered by one of them, because the father could not be identified with DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-identical-twins-child-maintenance-paternity-dna-test-goias-a8852436.html|title=Identical twins both ordered to pay child support after DNA tests fail to determine who baby's father is|last=Cockburn|first=Harry|date=2019-04-03|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n\n===Australia===\nPeace-of-mind parentage tests are widely available on the internet.

Section 45 states that it is an offence to possess without appropriate consent any human bodily material with the intent of analysing its DNA. Legally declared fathers have access to paternity-testing services under the new regulations, provided the putative parental DNA being tested is their own. Tests are sometimes ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required. In the UK, the [[Ministry of Justice]] accredits bodies that can conduct this testing. The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] produced a voluntary code of practice on genetic paternity testing in 2001. This document is currently under review, and responsibility for it has been transferred to the [[Human Tissue Authority]].\nIn the 2018 case of [https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2016/851.html Anderson V Spencer] the Court of Appeal permitted for the very first time DNA samples taken from a Deceased person to be used for paternity testing.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are readily available for purchase, though their results are not admissible in court and are for personal knowledge only. \n\nOnly a court-ordered paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings. If parental testing is being submitted for legal purposes, including immigration, testing must be ordered through a lab that has [[AABB]] accreditation for relationship DNA testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/Content/Accreditation/Parentage_Testing_Accreditation_Program/AABB_Accredited_Parentage_Testing_Laboratories/|title=Accredited Parentage Testing Facilities|date=18 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218003033/http://www.aabb.org/Content/Accreditation/Parentage_Testing_Accreditation_Program/AABB_Accredited_Parentage_Testing_Laboratories/|archivedate=18 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe legal implications of a parentage result test vary by state and according to whether the putative parents are unmarried or married. If a parentage test does not meet forensic standards for the state in question, a court-ordered test may be required for the results of the test to be admissible for legal purposes. For unmarried parents, if a parent is currently receiving child support or custody, but DNA testing later proves that the man is not the father, support automatically stops. However, in many states, this testing must be performed during a narrow window of time, if a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form has already been signed by the putative father; otherwise, the results of the test may be disregarded by law, and in many cases, a man may be required to pay child support, though the child is biologically unrelated. In a few states, if the mother is receiving the support, then that alleged father has the right to file a lawsuit to get back any money that he lost from paying support. As of 2011, in most states, unwed parents confronted with a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form are informed of the possibility and right to request a DNA paternity test. If testing is refused by the mother, the father may not be required to sign the [[birth certificate]] or the voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form for the child. For wedded putative parents, the husband of the mother is presumed to be the father of the child. But, in most states, this presumption can be overturned by the application of a forensic paternity test; in many states, the time for overturning this presumption may be limited to the first few years of the child's life.\n\n==Reverse paternity testing==\nReverse paternity determination is the ability to establish the biological father when the father of that person is not available. The test uses the STR [[alleles]] in the mother and her child, other children and brothers of the alleged father, and deduction of genetic constitution of the father by the basis of genetic laws, all to create a rough amalgamation. This can compare the father's DNA when a direct sample of the father's DNA is unavailable. An episode of ''[[Solved (TV series)|Solved]]'' shows this test being used to know if a blood sample matches with the victim of a kidnapping.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Paternity fraud]]\n*[[Mosaic (genetics)|Mosaicism]] and [[chimerism]], rare genetic conditions that can result in false negative results on DNA-based tests\n*[[Non-paternity event]]\n*''[[Lauren Lake's Paternity Court]]'', a television series that debuted in fall 2013\n\n'''Genetic:'''\n*[[Heritability]]\n*[[List of Mendelian traits in humans]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.hta.gov.uk/faqs/analysis-dna-under-ht-act-faqs#faq13915 UK paternity testing regulations] per the [[Human Tissue Authority]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parental Testing}}\n[[Category:Applied genetics]]\n[[Category:Forensic genetics]]\n[[Category:DNA]]\n[[Category:Family law]]\n[[Category:Parenting]]\n[[Category:Paternity|Testing]]\n[[Category:Fathers' rights]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|DNA matching techniques to identify someone's father}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n\n'''DNA paternity testing''' is the use of [[DNA profiling|DNA profiles]] to determine whether an individual is the [[biology|biological]] parent of another individual. Paternity testing can be especially important when the rights and duties of the father are in issue and a child's [[Father|paternity]] is in doubt. Tests can also determine the likelihood of someone being a biological grandparent. Though [[genetics|genetic]] testing is the most reliable standard, older methods also exist, including [[blood type|ABO blood group typing]], analysis of various other [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s, or using [[human leukocyte antigen]] [[antigen]]s. The current techniques for paternity testing are using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP). Paternity testing can now also be performed while the woman is still pregnant from a blood draw.<ref>[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1113044 \"A Non-invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy\" New England Journal of Medicine May 3, 2012]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html|title=Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=19 June 2012|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nDNA testing is currently the most advanced and accurate technology to determine parentage.

However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as \"[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]\", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693|title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|date=2006-08-15|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Paternity or maternity testing for child or adult==\nThe DNA test is performed by collecting buccal (cheek) cells found on the inside of a person's cheek using a buccal or cheek [[Cotton swab|swab]]. These swabs have wooden or plastic stick handles with a cotton on synthetic tip. The collector rubs the inside of a person's cheek to collect as many buccal cells as possible, which are then sent to a laboratory for testing. Samples from the alleged father or mother and the child would be needed.\n\n==Prenatal paternity testing for unborn child==\n\n===Invasive prenatal paternity testing===\nIt is possible to determine who the biological father of the fetus is while the woman is still pregnant through procedures called [[chorionic villus sampling]] or [[amniocentesis]]. Chorionic villus sampling retrieves placental tissue in either a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother's abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, there is a small risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result. Both CVS and Amnio require the pregnant woman to visit a genetic specialist known as a maternal fetal medicine specialist who will perform the procedure.\n\n===Non-invasive prenatal paternity testing===\nAdvances in genetic testing have led to the ability to identify the biological father while the woman is still pregnant. There is a small amount of fetal DNA ([[cffDNA]]) present in the mother's blood during pregnancy. This allows for accurate fetal DNA paternity testing during pregnancy from a blood draw with no risk of miscarriage. Studies have shown that cffDNA can first be observed as early as 7 weeks gestation, and the amount of cffDNA increases as the pregnancy progresses.<ref>{{cite journal|title=\"The New England Journal of Medicine \"A Non-invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy\" May 3, 2012|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=366|issue=18|pages=1743\u20131745|publisher=The New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1113044|pmid=22551147|year=2012|last1=Guo|first1=Xin|last2=Bayliss|first2=Philip|last3=Damewood|first3=Marian|last4=Varney|first4=John|last5=Ma|first5=Emily|last6=Vallecillo|first6=Brett|last7=Dhallan|first7=Ravinder}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html?pagewanted=all&_moc.semityn.www/|title=The New York Times \"Before Birth, Dad's I.D.\" June 20, 2012|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==DNA profiling==\n[[File:DNA paternity testing en.svg|thumb|Example of DNA profiling in order to determine the father of a child (Ch).

Specific sequences are examined to see if they were copied verbatim from one individual's genome; if so, then the genetic material of one individual could have been derived from that of the other (i.e. one is the parent of the other). Besides nuclear DNA, [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] also have their own genetic material called [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, without any shuffling.\n\nProving a relationship based on comparison of the mitochondrial genome is much easier than that based on the nuclear genome. However, testing the mitochondrial genome can prove only if two individuals are related by [[common descent]] through maternal lines only from a common ancestor and is, thus, of limited value (i.e., it could not be used to test for paternity).\n\nIn testing the paternity of a male child, comparison of the [[Y chromosome]] can be used, since it is passed directly from father to son.\n\nIn the US, the [[AABB]] has regulations for DNA paternity and family relationship testing, but AABB accreditation is not required. DNA test results are legally admissible if the collection and the processing follows a chain of custody. Similarly in Canada, the SCC has regulations on DNA paternity and relationship testing, but this accreditation, while recommended, is not required.\n\nThe Paternity Testing Commission of the [[International Society for Forensic Genetics]] has taken up the task of establishing the biostatistical recommendations in accordance with the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] standards.<ref name=\"GjertsonBrenner2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Gjertson|first1=David W.|last2=Brenner|first2=Charles H.|last3=Baur|first3=Max P.|last4=Carracedo|first4=Angel|last5=Guidet|first5=Francois|last6=Luque|first6=Juan A.|last7=Lessig|first7=R\u00fcdiger|last8=Mayr|first8=Wolfgang R.|last9=Pascali|first9=Vince L.|last10=Prinz|first10=Mechthild|last11=Schneider|first11=Peter M.|last12=Morling|first12=Niels|title=ISFG: Recommendations on biostatistics in paternity testing|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=1|issue=3\u20134|year=2007|pages=223\u2013231|issn=1872-4973|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2007.06.006|pmid=19083766}}</ref> Bio-statistical evaluations of paternity should be based on a likelihood ratio principle - yielding the [[Paternity Index]], PI. The recommendations provide guidance on concepts of genetic hypotheses and calculation concerns needed to produce valid PIs, as well as on specific issues related to [[population genetics]].\n\n==History==\nThe first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching [[blood type]]s between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent under this form of testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnacenter.com/science-technology/dna-history-1920.html|title=History of DNA Testing - DNA Diagnostics Center}}</ref> In the 1930s, [[serology|serological]] testing, which tests certain proteins in the blood, became available, with a 40% exclusion rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnacenter.com/science-technology/dna-history-1930.html|title=History of DNA Testing - DNA Diagnostics Center}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, highly accurate genetic paternity testing became a possibility when [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] typing was developed, which compares the genetic fingerprints on white blood cells between the child and alleged parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19771223&id=AAkdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7Z4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6700,5859572|title=The Tuscaloosa News - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> HLA tests could be done with 80% accuracy but could not distinguish between close relatives.<ref name=answers>{{cite web|url=http://www.paternity-answers.com/history-paternity-test.html|title=Paternity Testing Resources|date=19 November 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119070715/http://www.paternity-answers.com/history-paternity-test.html|archivedate=19 November 2004}}</ref> Genetic parental testing technology advanced further with the isolation of the first [[restriction enzyme]] in 1970. Highly accurate DNA parental testing became available in the 1980s with the development of [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]]. In the 1990s, [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] became the standard method for DNA parental testing: a simpler, faster, and more accurate method of testing than RFLP, it has an exclusion rate of 99.99% or higher.<ref name=answers/>\n\n==Legal evidence==\nThe DNA parentage test that follows strict [[chain of custody]] can generate legally admissible results that are used for child support, inheritance, social welfare benefits, immigration, or adoption purposes. To satisfy the chain-of-custody legal requirements, all tested parties have to be properly identified and their specimens collected by a third-party professional who is not related to any of the tested parties and has no interest in the outcome of the test.\n\nThe [[Legal burden of proof|quantum of evidence]] needed is [[clear and convincing evidence]]: that is, more evidence than an ordinary case in [[civil litigation]], but less than beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] required to convict a defendant in a criminal case.\n\nIn recent years, immigration authorities in various countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and others, may accept DNA parentage test results from immigration petitioners and beneficiaries in a family-based immigration case when primary documents that prove biological relationship are missing or inadequate.\n\nIn the U.S., immigration applicants bear the responsibility of arranging and paying for DNA testing. The U.S. immigration authorities require that the DNA test, if pursued, be performed by one of the laboratories accredited by the [[AABB]] (formerly American Association of Blood Banks). Similarly, in Canada, the lab needs to be accredited by the SCC.\n\nAlthough paternity tests are more common than maternity tests, there may be circumstances in which the biological mother of the child is unclear. Examples include cases of an [[Adoption|adopted]] child attempting to reunify with his or her biological mother, potential [[Babies switched at birth|hospital mix-ups]], and [[in vitro fertilization]] where the laboratory may have implanted an unrelated embryo inside the mother.\n\nOther factors, such as new laws regarding reproductive technologies using donated eggs and sperm and surrogate mothers, can mean that the female giving birth is not necessarily the legal mother of the child. For example, in Canada, the federal ''Human Assisted Reproduction Act'' provides for the use of hired surrogate mothers. The legal mother of the child may be the egg donor. Similar laws are in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nIn Brazil in 2019, two male identical twins were ordered to both pay maintenance for a child fathered by one of them, because the father could not be identified with DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-identical-twins-child-maintenance-paternity-dna-test-goias-a8852436.html|title=Identical twins both ordered to pay child support after DNA tests fail to determine who baby's father is|last=Cockburn|first=Harry|date=2019-04-03|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n\n===Australia===\nPeace-of-mind parentage tests are widely available on the internet.

Family courts have the power to order paternity tests against the will of the father in divorce and child support cases, as well as in other cases such as determining heirs and settling the question involving the population registry. A man seeking to prove that he is not the father of the child registered as his is entitled to a paternity test, even if the mother and natural guardian object.

Section 45 states that it is an offence to possess without appropriate consent any human bodily material with the intent of analysing its DNA. Legally declared fathers have access to paternity-testing services under the new regulations, provided the putative parental DNA being tested is their own. Tests are sometimes ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required. In the UK, the [[Ministry of Justice]] accredits bodies that can conduct this testing. The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] produced a voluntary code of practice on genetic paternity testing in 2001. This document is currently under review, and responsibility for it has been transferred to the [[Human Tissue Authority]].\nIn the 2018 case of [https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2016/851.html Anderson V Spencer] the Court of Appeal permitted for the very first time DNA samples taken from a Deceased person to be used for paternity testing.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are readily available for purchase, though their results are not admissible in court and are for personal knowledge only. \n\nOnly a court-ordered paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings. If parental testing is being submitted for legal purposes, including immigration, testing must be ordered through a lab that has [[AABB]] accreditation for relationship DNA testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/Content/Accreditation/Parentage_Testing_Accreditation_Program/AABB_Accredited_Parentage_Testing_Laboratories/|title=Accredited Parentage Testing Facilities|date=18 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218003033/http://www.aabb.org/Content/Accreditation/Parentage_Testing_Accreditation_Program/AABB_Accredited_Parentage_Testing_Laboratories/|archivedate=18 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe legal implications of a parentage result test vary by state and according to whether the putative parents are unmarried or married. If a parentage test does not meet forensic standards for the state in question, a court-ordered test may be required for the results of the test to be admissible for legal purposes. For unmarried parents, if a parent is currently receiving child support or custody, but DNA testing later proves that the man is not the father, support automatically stops. However, in many states, this testing must be performed during a narrow window of time, if a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form has already been signed by the putative father; otherwise, the results of the test may be disregarded by law, and in many cases, a man may be required to pay child support, though the child is biologically unrelated. In a few states, if the mother is receiving the support, then that alleged father has the right to file a lawsuit to get back any money that he lost from paying support. As of 2011, in most states, unwed parents confronted with a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form are informed of the possibility and right to request a DNA paternity test. If testing is refused by the mother, the father may not be required to sign the [[birth certificate]] or the voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form for the child. For wedded putative parents, the husband of the mother is presumed to be the father of the child. But, in most states, this presumption can be overturned by the application of a forensic paternity test; in many states, the time for overturning this presumption may be limited to the first few years of the child's life.\n\n==Reverse paternity testing==\nReverse paternity determination is the ability to establish the biological father when the father of that person is not available. The test uses the STR [[alleles]] in the mother and her child, other children and brothers of the alleged father, and deduction of genetic constitution of the father by the basis of genetic laws, all to create a rough amalgamation. This can compare the father's DNA when a direct sample of the father's DNA is unavailable. An episode of ''[[Solved (TV series)|Solved]]'' shows this test being used to know if a blood sample matches with the victim of a kidnapping.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Paternity fraud]]\n*[[Mosaic (genetics)|Mosaicism]] and [[chimerism]], rare genetic conditions that can result in false negative results on DNA-based tests\n*[[Non-paternity event]]\n*''[[Lauren Lake's Paternity Court]]'', a television series that debuted in fall 2013\n\n'''Genetic:'''\n*[[Heritability]]\n*[[List of Mendelian traits in humans]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.hta.gov.uk/faqs/analysis-dna-under-ht-act-faqs#faq13915 UK paternity testing regulations] per the [[Human Tissue Authority]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parental Testing}}\n[[Category:Applied genetics]]\n[[Category:Forensic genetics]]\n[[Category:DNA]]\n[[Category:Family law]]\n[[Category:Parenting]]\n[[Category:Paternity|Testing]]\n[[Category:Fathers' rights]]\n", "name_user": "Vdapinto", "label": "safe", "comment": "error editing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_paternity_testing"}
