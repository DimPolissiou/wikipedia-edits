Retrieved 25 March 2011 \"BBC\"</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOperation Telic was one of the largest deployments of British forces since [[World War II]]. It was only approached in size by the 1991 [[Operation Granby]] deployment for the [[Gulf War]] and the 1956 [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] [[Suez Crisis]] deployment. It was considerably larger than the 1982 [[Operation Corporate]] in the [[Falklands War]], which saw around 30,000 personnel deployed and the [[Korean War]], which saw fewer than 20,000 personnel deployed.\n\nSome 9,500 of the British servicemen and women who deployed on Operation Telic for the invasion and its aftermath were reservists, from the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and from the [[RAF Regiment|Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment.]]\n\nNotice that additional British forces were deploying to the region (large numbers of RAF personnel were already deployed in Kuwait, Turkey and elsewhere in the region on [[Operation Northern Watch|Operations Northern Watch]] and [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch]]) was given in three separate [[British House of Commons|Commons]] statements by [[Geoff Hoon]] [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. On 7 January, the deployment of [[Naval Force|naval forces]] and [[Royal Marines]] was announced. 20 January saw the land forces deployment announced and 6 February the air forces. They were ready in time for hostilities to start on 19 March. When compared with the deployment of forces prior to the Gulf War things proceeded a great deal faster, with the slowest deploying elements taking 10 weeks to get from base to [[combat]] readiness in the theatre.\n\nThe deployment used 64 British and foreign flagged merchant vessels.\n\n[[wiktionary:telic|''Telic'']] means a purposeful or defined action (from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, ''telos''). Unlike the United States who called their equivalent military deployment [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] uses a computer to generate its names so that they carry no overtly political connotations. The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst personnel as a [[backronym]] for '''T'''ell '''E'''veryone '''L'''eave '''I'''s '''C'''ancelled.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bullet Magnet: Britain's Most Highly Decorated Frontline Soldier|author-link=Mick Flynn|first=Mick|last=Flynn|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK]]|date=2010|isbn=9780297860013}}</ref>\n\n==Command structure==\nThe force was commanded by a [[3 star rank|three-star]] tri-service headquarters. The commander of the operation was [[Air Chief Marshal|Air Marshal]] [[Brian Burridge]], with [[Major General]] [[Peter Wall (British Army Officer)|Peter Wall]] acting as his Chief of Staff. The headquarters was situated at [[CENTCOM]] headquarters in [[Qatar]].

Unlike the invasion period, by then there was a substantial presence from many nations other than America, Britain, Australia and Poland. In addition to British troops, 3rd Division now commanded [[Italy|Italian]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]], Lithuanian, [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[New Zealand]] forces. 3rd Division handed over a new composite divisional headquarters on 28 December 2003. Major General [[Andrew Stewart (British Army officer)|Andrew Stewart]] took over from General Lamb as commander of British forces.\n\nAfter the end of major operations, the main components of the British forces changed greatly. [[3 Commando Brigade]] was withdrawn in early May and 16 Air Assault Brigade left later in the same month apart from a couple of infantry battalions. [[7 Armoured Brigade]] remained until relieved by 19 Mechanised Brigade at the same time as 3rd Division took over from 1st Division. [[102nd Logistics Brigade (United Kingdom)|102 Logistics Brigade]] was relieved by [[101 Logistic Brigade]] in late May.

It was only approached in size by the 1991 [[Operation Granby]] deployment for the [[Gulf War]] and the 1956 [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] [[Suez Crisis]] deployment. It was considerably larger than the 1982 [[Operation Corporate]] in the [[Falklands War]], which saw around 30,000 personnel deployed and the [[Korean War]], which saw fewer than 20,000 personnel deployed.\n\nSome 9,500 of the British servicemen and women who deployed on Operation Telic for the invasion and its aftermath were reservists, from the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and from the [[RAF Regiment|Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment.]]\n\nNotice that additional British forces were deploying to the region (large numbers of RAF personnel were already deployed in Kuwait, Turkey and elsewhere in the region on [[Operation Northern Watch|Operations Northern Watch]] and [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch]]) was given in three separate [[British House of Commons|Commons]] statements by [[Geoff Hoon]] [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. On 7 January, the deployment of [[Naval Force|naval forces]] and [[Royal Marines]] was announced. 20 January saw the land forces deployment announced and 6 February the air forces. They were ready in time for hostilities to start on 19 March. When compared with the deployment of forces prior to the Gulf War things proceeded a great deal faster, with the slowest deploying elements taking 10 weeks to get from base to [[combat]] readiness in the theatre.\n\nThe deployment used 64 British and foreign flagged merchant vessels.\n\n[[wiktionary:telic|''Telic'']] means a purposeful or defined action (from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, ''telos''). Unlike the United States who called their equivalent military deployment [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] uses a computer to generate its names so that they carry no overtly political connotations. The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst personnel as a [[backronym]] for '''T'''ell '''E'''veryone '''L'''eave '''I'''s '''C'''ancelled.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bullet Magnet: Britain's Most Highly Decorated Frontline Soldier|author-link=Mick Flynn|first=Mick|last=Flynn|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK]]|date=2010|isbn=9780297860013}}</ref>\n\n==Command structure==\nThe force was commanded by a [[3 star rank|three-star]] tri-service headquarters.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had begun their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had begun their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India.
