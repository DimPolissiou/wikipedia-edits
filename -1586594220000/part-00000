Four days before the Exodus, the Hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3|HE}}), and inspect it daily for blemishes. During the day on the 14th of Nisan, they were to slaughter the animal and use its blood to mark their [[Post and lintel|lintels and door posts]].

[[Yahweh]], the God of the Israelites, appears to Moses in a [[burning bush]] and commands Moses to confront [[Pharaoh]]. To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\n\n{{quote|This is what the {{LORD}} says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.

There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt{{snd}}worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.\"|Exodus 11:4\u20136}}\n\nBefore this final plague Yahweh commands Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a [[domestic sheep|lamb]]'s blood above their doors in order that Yahweh will pass over them (i.e., that they will not be touched by the death of the firstborn).\n\nThe biblical regulations for the observance of the festival require that all [[Leavening agent|leavening]] be disposed of before the beginning of the 15th of Nisan<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|13:7|HE}}</ref> An unblemished lamb or goat, known as the ''[[Passover sacrifice|Korban Pesach]]'' or \"Paschal Lamb\", is to be set apart on 10th Nisan,<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3|HE}}</ref> and slaughtered at dusk as 14th Nisan ends in preparation for the 15th of Nisan when it will be eaten after being roasted.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|HE}}</ref> The literal meaning of the Hebrew is \"between the two evenings\".<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|ESV}} English Standard Version</ref> It is then to be eaten \"that night\", 15th Nisan,<ref name=\"Exodus 12:8\">{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:8|HE}}</ref> roasted, without the removal of its internal organs<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}</ref> with unleavened bread, known as [[matzo]], and bitter herbs known as ''[[maror]]''.<ref name=\"Exodus 12:8\"/> Nothing of the sacrifice on which the sun rises by the morning of the 15th of Nisan may be eaten, but must be burned.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}}</ref>\n\nThe biblical regulations pertaining to the original Passover, at the time of the Exodus only, also include how the meal was to be eaten: \"with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the [[Names of God in Judaism|LORD]]'s passover\" {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:11|HE}}.\n\nThe biblical requirements of slaying the Paschal lamb in the individual homes of the Hebrews and smearing the blood of the lamb on their doorways were celebrated in Egypt. However, once Israel was in the wilderness and the tabernacle was in operation, a change was made in those two original requirements ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:2\u20136|HE}}).

Jews outside the Land of Israel celebrate the festival for eight days. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] Jews usually celebrate the holiday over seven days.

Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]''). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all leaven (''chametz'')==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\nLeaven, in Hebrew ''[[Chametz#What is chametz?|chametz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5</big> ''\u1e25amets'', \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes.

It may be simply used up, thrown out (historically, destroyed by burning), or given or sold to non-Jews (or non-Samaritans, as the case may be).\n* To refrain from eating ''chametz'' or mixtures containing ''chametz'' during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|13:3|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:20|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:3|HE}}).\n* Not to possess ''chametz'' in one's domain (i.e. home, office, car, etc.) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:19|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:4|HE}}).\n\nObservant Jews spend the weeks before Passover in a flurry of thorough housecleaning, to remove every morsel of ''chametz'' from every part of the home. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires the elimination of [[olive]]-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any item or implement that has handled ''chametz'' is generally put away and not used during Passover.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/ultra-orthodox-burn-leavened-food-before-passover-begins-1.356761 |title=Ultra Orthodox burn leavened food before Passover |work=Haaretz |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome [[hotel]]s, [[resort]]s, and even [[cruise ship]]s across [[United States|America]], [[Europe]] and [[Israel]] also undergo a thorough housecleaning to make their premises \"kosher for Pesach\" to cater to observant Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/guide-to-kosher-travel-4050383|title=Get Out of Town: Your Guide to Kosher Travel|first=Miri|last=Rotkovitz|date=May 6, 2016|accessdate=April 10, 2017|website=The Spruce}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretations for abstinence from leaven or yeast===\nSome scholars suggest that the command to abstain from leavened food or yeast suggests that sacrifices offered to God involve the offering of objects in \"their least altered state\", that would be nearest to the way in which they were initially made by God.<ref name=\"Bokser\">Bokser, Baruch M.

Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain \"Chametz\" shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering.

Each householder must put aside all the ''chametz'' he is selling into a box or cupboard, and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the ''chametz'' to a non-Jew (who is not obligated to celebrate the commandments) in exchange for a small [[down payment]] (''e.g.'' $1.00), with the remainder due after Passover. This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property.

The [[Talmud]]ic sages instructed that a search for ''chametz'' be made in every home, place of work, or any place where ''chametz'' may have been brought during the year.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\">{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Avie |last2=Zlotowitz|first2=Meir |last3=Scherman|first3=Nosson |title=The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Pesach|date=1990\u20132002|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=0-89906-696-8|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> When the first Seder is on a Saturday night, the search is conducted on the preceding Thursday night (thirteenth of Nisan) as [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|''chametz'' cannot be burned during Shabbat]].\n\nThe [[Talmud]] in [[Pesahim]] (p.&nbsp;2a) derives from the [[Torah]] that the search for ''chametz'' be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the ''chametz'' (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all ''chametz'' from one's possession.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n===Blessing for search of chametz and nullification of chametz===\nBefore the search is begun there is a special [[Berakhah|blessing]]. If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\n\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\n\n(''ber\u016bkh otah, YEH'WAH alihiyn\u016b, melekh ha-\u2018\u00f4lam, eser qedesh-n\u016b be-mits\u016btayu we-tsewin\u016b \u2018al be-\u00f4r \u1e25amets'')\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of leaven===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of [[Beta Israel|Falashah]], Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3\u201311|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' (leaven) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news |last= Lagnado |first= Lucette |title= As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches |page= A1 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= New York |date= April 18, 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740 }}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise.

There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com \u2013 Judaism, Ask a Rabbi \u2013 Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\").

In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8</big> ''seder'' \u2013 derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual).

The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ''ve-yimareru'') their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe [[afikoman|''afikoman'']] \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|pages=36\u201337|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=\"Barley\"/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]]. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, no work is performed on those days, with most of the rules relating to the observances of [[Shabbat]] being applied.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nOutside Israel, in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with [[Eastern Europe]]an backgrounds, [[borsht]], a soup made with [[beet]]s, is a Passover tradition.<ref>https://forward.com/food/134439/the-perfect-borscht/</ref>\n[[File:Wonder Pot cake.jpg|150px|thumb|A Passover brownie cake baked in a [[Wonder Pot]].]]\nWhile kosher for Passover packaged goods are available in stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week.

Outside the [[Land of Israel]], in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''Shvi'i shel Pesach'' is celebrated on both the seventh and eighth days of Passover.<ref>The eighth day is known as ''Acharon shel Pesach,'' \"last [day] of Passover\".</ref> This holiday commemorates the day the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] reached the [[Red Sea]] and witnessed both the miraculous \"Splitting of the Sea\" ([[Passage of the Red Sea]]), the drowning of all the Egyptian chariots, horses and soldiers that pursued them. According to the [[Midrash]], only the [[Pharaoh]] was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.\n\n[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s traditionally hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'' on the night of ''Shvi'i shel Pesach'' and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them. They use this opportunity to speak about the Splitting of the Sea to their disciples, and sing songs of praise to God.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Second Passover==\nThe \"Second Passover\" ([[Pesach Sheni]]) on the 14th of Iyar in the [[Hebrew Calendar]] is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s [[Book of Numbers]] ({{Bibleref2|Numbers 9:6\u201313}}) as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the pesach sacrifice at the appropriate time due to [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]] or distance from [[Jerusalem]]. Just as on the first Pesach night, breaking bones from the second Paschal offering or leaving meat over until morning is prohibited ({{Bibleref2|Numbers 9:12}}).<ref>https://www.halakhah.com/rst/pesach.pdf</ref>\n\nToday, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and traditional [[Conservative Judaism]]). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities ''[[Tachanun]]'', a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torah.org/learning/yomtov-omer-5755-vol1no21/|title=YomTov, Vol. I, # 21 \u2013 Pesach Sheni, The \"Second\" Pesach |website=Torah.org}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional foods==\n[[File:Matzah brei serving.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Matzah brei]] (fried [[matzo]] and egg), a popular Passover dish]]\nBecause the house is free of leaven (''chametz'') for eight days, the Jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of Passover.

Alstat]], an early leader of [[Conservative Judaism]], known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:<ref>[[Canadian Jewish Chronicle|The Canadian Jewish Chronicle]], March 31, 1939</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating \"the bread of affliction\"? Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 978-3110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name#v=onepage|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination.

Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that mus have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucifed during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining.

To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\n\n{{quote|This is what the {{LORD}} says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.

Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]''). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all leaven (''chametz'')==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\nLeaven, in Hebrew ''[[Chametz#What is chametz?|chametz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5</big> ''\u1e25amets'', \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes.

In some cases, they may never leave the house, instead being formally sold while remaining in the original owner's possession in a locked cabinet until they can be repurchased after the holiday. Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain \"Chametz\" shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering. Although the practice of selling \"Chametz\" dates back many years, some Reform rabbinical authorities have come to regard it with disdain \u2013 since the supposed \"new owner\" never takes actual possession of the goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louisjacobs.org/jewish-holidays/the-laws-of-pesach/|title=The Laws of Pesach|first1=Louis|last1=Jacobs|first2=Michael|last2=Rose|date=March 23, 1983|accessdate=April 10, 2017|website=Friends of Louis Jacobs}}</ref>\n\nThe sale of ''chametz'' may also be conducted communally via a [[rabbi]], who becomes the \"agent\" for all the community's Jews through a halakhic procedure called a ''kinyan'' (acquisition). Each householder must put aside all the ''chametz'' he is selling into a box or cupboard, and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the ''chametz'' to a non-Jew (who is not obligated to celebrate the commandments) in exchange for a small [[down payment]] (''e.g.'' $1.00), with the remainder due after Passover. This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property. The rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday.<ref>[http://www.torahlearningcenter.com/jhq/question169.html Pesach questions and answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143423/http://www.torahlearningcenter.com/jhq/question169.html |date=September 28, 2007}} by the Torah Learning Center.\nRetrieved on March 31, 2018</ref>\n\n==Search for leaven {{anchor|Formal search for chametz}}==\n{{main|bedikat chametz}}\n{{Wikisource|1=Translation:Talmud/Seder Moed/Tractate Pesachim/2a|2=Talmud's introduction to checking for chametz and defining ''or'' (literally, \"light\") (Tractate Pesachim 2a)}}\n\nOn the night of the fourteenth of [[Nisan]], the night before the [[Passover Seder]] (after nightfall on the evening before Passover eve), Jews do a formal search in their homes known as ''[[bedikat chametz]]'' for any possible remaining leaven (''[[chametz]]''). The [[Talmud]]ic sages instructed that a search for ''chametz'' be made in every home, place of work, or any place where ''chametz'' may have been brought during the year.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\">{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Avie |last2=Zlotowitz|first2=Meir |last3=Scherman|first3=Nosson |title=The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Pesach|date=1990\u20132002|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=0-89906-696-8|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> When the first Seder is on a Saturday night, the search is conducted on the preceding Thursday night (thirteenth of Nisan) as [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|''chametz'' cannot be burned during Shabbat]].\n\nThe [[Talmud]] in [[Pesahim]] (p.&nbsp;2a) derives from the [[Torah]] that the search for ''chametz'' be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the ''chametz'' (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all ''chametz'' from one's possession.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n===Blessing for search of chametz and nullification of chametz===\nBefore the search is begun there is a special [[Berakhah|blessing]]. If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\n\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\n\n(''ber\u016bkh otah, YEH'WAH alihiyn\u016b, melekh ha-\u2018\u00f4lam, eser qedesh-n\u016b be-mits\u016btayu we-tsewin\u016b \u2018al be-\u00f4r \u1e25amets'')\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of leaven===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of [[Beta Israel|Falashah]], Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3\u201311|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' (leaven) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news |last= Lagnado |first= Lucette |title= As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches |page= A1 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= New York |date= April 18, 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740 }}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18|HE}}</ref> Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the [[Passover Seder]]. There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com \u2013 Judaism, Ask a Rabbi \u2013 Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.<ref>[http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=450 What is the kabbalistic view on chametz?] by Rabbi Yossi Marcus</ref>\n\n[[File:Shmura Matzo2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hand made ''shmura matzo'']]\n\n''Shmura matzo'' (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.

In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8</big> ''seder'' \u2013 derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the [[Haggadah]]. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:\n\n# ''Kadeish/ Qad\u0113sh'' <big>\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9</big> \u2013 recital of [[Kiddush]] blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\n# ''Urchatz/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25ats/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 the [[Handwashing in Judaism|washing of the hands]] \u2013 without blessing\n# ''Karpas'' <big>\u05db\u05e8\u05e4\u05e1</big> \u2013 dipping of the ''[[karpas]]'' in salt water\n# ''Yachatz/ Ya\u1e25ats/ Ya\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d9\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the ''[[afikoman]]'' which is eaten later during the ritual of ''Tzafun''\n# ''Maggid/ Maggiyd'' <big>\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3</big> \u2013 retelling the Passover story, including the recital of \"[[the four questions]]\" and drinking of the second cup of wine\n# ''Rachtzah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7tsah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e8\u05d7\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 second washing of the hands \u2013 with blessing\n# ''Motzi/ M\u00f4tsiy\u2019/ M\u00f4\u1e63iy\u2019'' <big>\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0</big> \u2013 traditional blessing before eating [[bread]] products\n# ''Matzo/ Ma\u1e63o'' <big>\u05de\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 blessing before eating [[matzo]]\n# ''Maror'' <big>\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8</big> \u2013 eating of the [[maror]]\n# ''Koreich/ Kor\u0113kh'' <big>\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror\n# ''Shulchan oreich/ Sh\u016bl\u00b7\u1e25an \u2018\u00f4r\u0113kh'' <big>\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 lit. \"set table\" \u2013 the serving of the holiday meal\n# ''Tzafun/ Tsaf\u016bn/ \u1e62af\u016bn'' <big>\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df</big> \u2013 eating of the ''[[afikoman]]''\n# ''Bareich/ Bar\u0113kh'' <big>\u05d1\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after the meal]] and drinking of the third cup of wine\n# ''[[Hallel]]'' <big>\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc</big> \u2013 recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine\n# ''Nirtzah/ Niyr\u00b7tsah/ Niyr\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 conclusion\n\nThese 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on which the [[Levite]]s stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] (#120\u2013134) known as ''Shir HaMa'a lot'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea}} ''shiyr ha-ma\u2018al\u00f4th'', \"[[Song of Ascents|Songs of Ascent]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhator.org.il/shir_hamaalot.php |title=Shir Ha Ma'a lot |publisher=Kolhator.org.il |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of [[Kiddush]] which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ''ve-yimareru'') their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe [[afikoman|''afikoman'']] \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|pages=36\u201337|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=\"Barley\"/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]]. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, no work is performed on those days, with most of the rules relating to the observances of [[Shabbat]] being applied.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nOutside Israel, in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with [[Eastern Europe]]an backgrounds, [[borsht]], a soup made with [[beet]]s, is a Passover tradition.<ref>https://forward.com/food/134439/the-perfect-borscht/</ref>\n[[File:Wonder Pot cake.jpg|150px|thumb|A Passover brownie cake baked in a [[Wonder Pot]].]]\nWhile kosher for Passover packaged goods are available in stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week.

According to the [[Midrash]], only the [[Pharaoh]] was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.\n\n[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s traditionally hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'' on the night of ''Shvi'i shel Pesach'' and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them. They use this opportunity to speak about the Splitting of the Sea to their disciples, and sing songs of praise to God.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Second Passover==\nThe \"Second Passover\" ([[Pesach Sheni]]) on the 14th of Iyar in the [[Hebrew Calendar]] is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s [[Book of Numbers]] ({{Bibleref2|Numbers 9:6\u201313}}) as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the pesach sacrifice at the appropriate time due to [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]] or distance from [[Jerusalem]]. Just as on the first Pesach night, breaking bones from the second Paschal offering or leaving meat over until morning is prohibited ({{Bibleref2|Numbers 9:12}}).<ref>https://www.halakhah.com/rst/pesach.pdf</ref>\n\nToday, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and traditional [[Conservative Judaism]]). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities ''[[Tachanun]]'', a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torah.org/learning/yomtov-omer-5755-vol1no21/|title=YomTov, Vol. I, # 21 \u2013 Pesach Sheni, The \"Second\" Pesach |website=Torah.org}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional foods==\n[[File:Matzah brei serving.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Matzah brei]] (fried [[matzo]] and egg), a popular Passover dish]]\nBecause the house is free of leaven (''chametz'') for eight days, the Jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of Passover.

Alstat]], an early leader of [[Conservative Judaism]], known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:<ref>[[Canadian Jewish Chronicle|The Canadian Jewish Chronicle]], March 31, 1939</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating \"the bread of affliction\"? Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 978-3110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name#v=onepage|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination.

Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that mus have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucifed during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining.

After impressing the England coaches by his ability, he was called up to play for his country at Schoolboy level. He went on to play three times for England during his youth. As Schoolboy football was so popular, Asher's England appearance against Scotland Schoolboys was attended by over 50,000 people.\n\n=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===\nWhen Asher was in his mid-teens, he was approached by top clubs who wanted to sign him to their team. In the end, it was a two horse race between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. The great [[Sir Matt busby|Sir Matt Busby]] visited Asher and his family at his home in [[Dunscroft]] in an attempt to secure his services. At the time, Wolves were the more successful team which is what turned Asher's head. He signed for the club's youth team and was a key figure in the 1954 team that reached the [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1950s|final]] of the [[FA Youth Cup]] against Manchester United, but was injured so couldn't participate. He scored twice in the cup run, against Derby County and Spalding United. As well as this, he assisted the Wolves youth team in winning the [[Birmingham & District Football League|Birmingham and District League]] title in the same season. At the end of a successful season for Asher, he desired to play football professionally and when [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] asked for his signature, he joined.\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Notts County ===\nAsher joined Notts County in 1954 and played there for 5 years. In that time he made 31 first-team appearances and scored 4 goals. To build up his confidence and ability, the club's coaches urged Asher to play in the team's reserve team before his debut. He agreed and spent three seasons with the reserves. Asher made his senior debut in a home game against Swansea Town (as they were then) in September 1957. Notts were beaten 4\u20132, but gained revenge in the return fixture a week later, winning 3-1 when Tommy scored the first of his four goals for the Magpies. He continued to be a squad player for until 1959 when he left the magpies to join Peterborough United.\n\n=== Peterborough United ===\nAsher then dropped out of League football and moved to non League club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], in 1959. At the time, they competed in the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Local sporting highlights from this week in years gone by\n|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/sport/local-sporting-highlights-from-this-week-in-years-gone-by-15-08-09-1-137235\n|work=Peterborough Telegraph\n|date=15 August 2009\n|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> Due to the sheer brilliance of rival inside forward [[Dennis Emery]], Asher struggled to forge a first team position so competed frequently for the reserves. He was described as \"a clever little player who certainly knew how to score\" and he showed that during his one and only season for the Posh as he scored 30 goals. He was a prolific goal scorer for the reserves and even scored 4 goals in one match against [[Harwich & Parkeston F.C.|Harwich & Parkeston]] on 10 October 1959 in the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]].\n\nHe made two first-team appearances for the Posh, the first a 2\u20131 loss against [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]]. Asher kept his place for the next Posh game, away at [[Spennymoor Town F.C.|Spennymoor Town]], which Posh won 3\u20131, but it proved to be his final first-team game for the club as he left at the end of the season to join [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Illkeston Town]].\n\n=== Illkeston Town ===\nAfter spending just one season at the Posh, he returned to Nottinghamshire to join [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] in the Central Alliance League in 1960. He joined up with the squad just before the start of the 1960/61 season and scored the winning goal on his debut in an away win against Nottingham Forest. His footballing artistry was seen at first hand but not frequently enough which resulted in his release in 1961. His final appearance was against Sutton Town on 14 October 1961. Asher went on to appear for [[Ransome & Marles F.C.|Ransome & Marles]], [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]] and [[Eastwood Town F.C.|Eastwood Town]] before playing for his final full-time club, [[Keyworth United F.C.|Keyworth United]] in 1966.\n\n== Post-football career ==\nAfter leaving Keyworth, Asher continued to play amateur football in Nottingham where he resided. Funnily, he discovered that he could make more money being a postman than he could a footballer. He then pursued this for many years. After moving to Gotham Village in Nottinghamshire, he became heavily involved in and around the village community. He was a popular figure around the area, being a school governor. To make some extra income and for his love of music, he became a DJ, spinning the discs at discos and parties around the Gotham area. Due to his footballing background and likeable nature, he became the manager and coach of the local children's football team 'Gotham Rangers F.C.'\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1957, aged 21, he married Glennis May Asher.

He also played for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Illkeston Town]], [[Ransome & Marles F.C.|Ransome & Marles]], [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]], [[Eastwood Town F.C.|Eastwood Town]] and [[Keyworth United F.C.|Keyworth United]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Notts County Former Players' Association Members List|url=http://www.ncfpa.co.uk/members.php|publisher=Notts County Former Players' Association|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> During his youth footballing days Tommy represented [[England schoolboys football team|England Schoolboys]] and played alongside the famous [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player, [[Duncan Edwards]].<ref name=\"poshtribute\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theposh.com/news/2017/march/club-historian-pays-tribute-to-tommy-asher/|title=Club Historian Pays Tribute To Tommy Asher|date=21 March 2017|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=Peterborough United F.C}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nAsher was born and raised in [[Dunscroft]] in Yorkshire.\n\n== Youth career ==\n\n=== Doncaster Schoolboys ===\nAs a young boy, Asher rose to prominence as a young player of great promise and his performances with Doncaster Schoolboys. After impressing the England coaches by his ability, he was called up to play for his country at Schoolboy level. He went on to play three times for England during his youth. As Schoolboy football was so popular, Asher's England appearance against Scotland Schoolboys was attended by over 50,000 people.\n\n=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===\nWhen Asher was in his mid-teens, he was approached by top clubs who wanted to sign him to their team. In the end, it was a two horse race between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. The great [[Sir Matt busby|Sir Matt Busby]] visited Asher and his family at his home in [[Dunscroft]] in an attempt to secure his services. At the time, Wolves were the more successful team which is what turned Asher's head. He signed for the club's youth team and was a key figure in the 1954 team that reached the [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1950s|final]] of the [[FA Youth Cup]] against Manchester United, but was injured so couldn't participate. He scored twice in the cup run, against Derby County and Spalding United. As well as this, he assisted the Wolves youth team in winning the [[Birmingham & District Football League|Birmingham and District League]] title in the same season. At the end of a successful season for Asher, he desired to play football professionally and when [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] asked for his signature, he joined.\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Notts County ===\nAsher joined Notts County in 1954 and played there for 5 years. In that time he made 31 first-team appearances and scored 4 goals. To build up his confidence and ability, the club's coaches urged Asher to play in the team's reserve team before his debut. He agreed and spent three seasons with the reserves. Asher made his senior debut in a home game against Swansea Town (as they were then) in September 1957. Notts were beaten 4-2, but gained revenge in the return fixture a week later, winning 3-1 when Tommy scored the first of his four goals for the Magpies. He continued to be a squad player for until 1959 when he left the magpies to join Peterborough United.\n\n=== Peterborough United ===\nAsher then dropped out of League football and moved to non League club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], in 1959. At the time, they competed in the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Local sporting highlights from this week in years gone by\n|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/sport/local-sporting-highlights-from-this-week-in-years-gone-by-15-08-09-1-137235\n|work=Peterborough Telegraph\n|date=15 August 2009\n|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> Due to the sheer brilliance of rival inside forward [[Dennis Emery]], Asher struggled to forge a first team position so competed frequently for the reserves. He was described as \"a clever little player who certainly knew how to score\" and he showed that during his one and only season for the Posh as he scored 30 goals. He was a prolific goal scorer for the reserves and even scored 4 goals in one match against [[Harwich & Parkeston F.C.|Harwich & Parkeston]] on 10 October 1959 in the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]].\n\nHe made two first-team appearances for the Posh, the first a 2-1 loss against [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]]. Asher kept his place for the next Posh game, away at [[Spennymoor Town F.C.|Spennymoor Town]], which Posh won 3-1, but it proved to be his final first-team game for the club as he left at the end of the season to join [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Illkeston Town]].\n\n=== Illkeston Town ===\nAfter spending just one season at the Posh, he returned to Nottinghamshire to join [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] in the Central Alliance League in 1960. He joined up with the squad just before the start of the 1960/61 season and scored the winning goal on his debut in an away win against Nottingham Forest. His footballing artistry was seen at first hand but not frequently enough which resulted in his release in 1961. His final appearance was against Sutton Town on 14 October 1961. Asher went on to appear for [[Ransome & Marles F.C.|Ransome & Marles]], [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]] and [[Eastwood Town F.C.|Eastwood Town]] before playing for his final full-time club, [[Keyworth United F.C.|Keyworth United]] in 1966.\n\n== Post-football career ==\nAfter leaving Keyworth, Asher continued to play amateur football in Nottingham where he resided. Funnily, he discovered that he could make more money being a postman than he could a footballer. He then pursued this for many years. After moving to Gotham Village in Nottinghamshire, he became heavily involved in and around the village community. He was a popular figure around the area, being a school governor. To make some extra income and for his love of music, he became a DJ, spinning the discs at discos and parties around the Gotham area. Due to his footballing background and likeable nature, he became the manager and coach of the local children's football team 'Gotham Rangers F.C.'\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1957, aged 21, he married Glennis May Asher. They had three children together: Neil, Tracey and Sally. Their children are Tom, Poppy, Milly, Charlotte, Alex, Jack and Katie. Towards the end of his life, he became a great-grandad to Kieran and Evie-May.\n\n== Death ==\nTommy Asher died at the age of 80 on 11 March 2017 in his home in Gotham, Nottinghamshire.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asher, Tommy}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n[[Category:Association football forwards]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n[[Category:Ilkeston Town F.C.

A series of appearances in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' by writer/penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] depicted the Kingpin as a scheming, cold-blooded crimelord who consistently stayed beyond the reach of the law. This remained the character's dominant form for decades<ref name=\"Comtois30\"/> as the Kingpin became widely regarded as Daredevil's [[archenemy]].<ref name=\"top 5 enemies of Daredevil\"/> He continues to be a recurring opponent of [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWilson Fisk began his life as a poor child in [[New York City]], bullied by his classmates due to his obesity. Fisk began training himself in physical combat, using his new-found strength to intimidate the bullies into joining his gang. He was eventually discovered by crimelord Don Rigoletto, and became the man's bodyguard and right-hand man. Eventually, Fisk killed his boss and took control of the gangster's criminal empire, becoming one of the most powerful figures in New York's underworld.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #-1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he had made enemies such as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime syndicate and the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. The two groups teamed together to oppose Fisk, causing him to flee to [[Japan]]. There, he started a [[spice]] business in order to regain his wealth. After earning enough money, Fisk returned to New York and started gang wars in an attempt to bring down the Maggia. With the criminal world in chaos, Fisk was able to step in and take back control.{{issue|date=January 2015}}\n\nFisk attempted a coalition of the New York mobs after hearing that Spider-Man had apparently gone out of action and ordered the abduction of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but was foiled by [[Spider-Man]] in his first confrontation with the web-slinger.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50-52. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile Fisk was a powerful crimelord, he posed as a legitimate businessman, one who made donations to [[charitable organization|charities]], and seemed like a generous, wealthy man. He eventually met and then married a woman named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]], with whom he had a son: [[Richard Fisk]]. Vanessa did not know that Fisk was a criminal when they married. Vanessa (having found out) threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. He retired from crime, and the family moved back to Japan.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #170-171. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nRichard did not find out that his father was a criminal until [[college]]. After graduating, Richard told his parents he would travel through [[Europe]]. Only months later, they received news that Richard (who was angry after learning the truth about his father) had died in a [[ski|skiing accident]]. However, it turned out that Richard was still alive and masqueraded as a rival crimelord known as the Schemer, intent on toppling his father as the Kingpin of Crime.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #83-85\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83-85.

His wife Vanessa was then kidnapped by said lieutenants who put out a contract on his life. After he witnessed Vanessa's apparent death, he returned to a life of crime. He regained control of the New York mobs because he had built them up in the first place and knew how to damage them; promises to keep the East Coast stable kept Midwestern crimelords happy and allowed him room to move. The Kingpin also gained [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s loyalty by promising steady work. The files were taken by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]; the Kingpin encouraged Daredevil to turn them over to the police as that would allow him to replace the arrested crimelords that much swifter. Daredevil did not turn them over because this would slow down the Kingpin's plans.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170-172 (May\u2013June 1981). Marvel Comics</ref> Kingpin maneuvered Daredevil into battling the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #174-175 (September\u2013October 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> He secretly promoted mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh. He then hired [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] as his assassin. Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac and returned Vanessa to him in exchange for his abandoning the Cherryh scheme. As retribution for this, he sent Elektra to kill [[Foggy Nelson]] (Daredevil's friend) but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye.<ref>''Daredevil'' #177-178 and #180-181. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Kingpin learned Daredevil's secret identity through information passed on from [[Karen Page]], Daredevil's ex-girlfriend who was now a pornographic film actress. The Kingpin used his influence to [[Daredevil: Born Again|destroy]] Matt Murdock's civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with Daredevil. This led to (among other events) brutalizing the reporter [[Ben Urich]], having his employees (such as [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] and [[Felix Manning]]) assaulting bribed policeman [[Nick Manolis]] and sending the homicidal patriot [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] into Hell's Kitchen. The last incident killed dozens of people, and the Kingpin was implicated. Though he avoided prison, his reputation was destroyed.<ref>''Daredevil: Born Again'' / ''Daredevil'' #227-233 (February\u2013August 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nKingpin was sought out by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (who was dating Spider-Man at the time) and feared a lack of powers would make the woman a liability to him. Black Cat paid Fisk to have scientists provide defensive bad luck powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempts to harm Black Cat in combat but also hurt and eventually kill anyone who stays nearby. The Kingpin hoped this would lead to Spider-Man's death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately broke up instead. Shortly after, Fisk was attacked by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100 (March 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk's scientists also created the supervillains the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] and the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\n===1990s===\nFisk later rehires Bullseye to investigate a New York drug war and survives an assassination attempt by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the [[Red Skull]] (Crossbones's employer). The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America's body) in personal combat.<ref>''Captain America'' #373 and #376-378 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFisk subsequently begins his own cable television station, partnering with an apparent Texas millionaire that the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the millionaire was actually bait planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from [[Nick Fury]], Daredevil spread the word through the underworld that the Kingpin had become a stooge of HYDRA, weakening his power. HYDRA steals the vast majority of his assets, bombs his businesses across New York City, and sends a helicopter gunship to attack his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery at Manhattan's [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Bailed out of jail by a rival who intends to use him as an errand boy, Fisk loses what remains of his sanity, murders his rival, and becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #297-300.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #15 (April 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to [[Samuel Silke]] (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin's new status as a blind man to rally supporters.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone. He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin). Fisk is imprisoned as a result.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #50 (October 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent \"Murdock Papers\" that Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. government is hard-pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil's DNA.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #79 (January 2006).

Finally, Murdock sacrifices the deal, refusing to let Bullseye (who was also incarcerated) leave the prison as the Kingpin had planned. The fight ends with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escapes.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #86-87 (August - September 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFisk appears in the 2006 ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: War Crimes'' one-shot issue, in which he offers information about [[Captain America]]'s Resistance base to [[Iron Man]], the leader of the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act|pro-Registration]] forces in exchange for a reduced sentence. But as his status in prison is threatened for collaborating with Iron Man, he betrays Iron Man.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He then puts out a hit on Spider-Man's loved ones after Iron Man convinced Peter Parker to publicly reveal himself as a means of demonstrating support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This results in [[Aunt May|May Parker]] being gravely wounded by a sniper's attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts the Kingpin in prison and badly beats him in front of his fellow inmates. Spider-Man decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld. Parker vows, however, to kill the Kingpin if May dies.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #538-542 (May\u2013August 2007).

However, the Shroud and Daredevil came into conflict when he and Jubua Pride, the Owl's daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Daredevil's law practice's clients. Daredevil went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Matt Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public.

With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' ''them'', prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire.

Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight [[sumo|sumo wrestler]], or some [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifters]] and [[Powerlifting|powerlifters]] but at greater strength levels. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #69, Marvel Comics</ref> Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling. His signature move is the [[bear hug]]. He has fought [[Captain America]] to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\"Captain America' 1972\"/> His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands;<ref>''Daredevil'' #170, Marvel Comics</ref> he stores his valuables in a safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171, Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHe typically wears [[Kevlar]] armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries an \"obliterator cane\", a walking stick that conceals a laser weapon that can vaporize a handgun or a person's head at close range. He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals compressed sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed into a victim's face. Due to his wealth and intellectual industry, Kingpin could use far more advanced paraphernalia, but he prefers to use such things as a last resort. As Fisk became less Spider-Man's enemy and more Daredevil's, he became more of a [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]] mafioso than a comic book criminal mastermind, and depended less on [[science fiction]]-like weaponry.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe United States government is aware of the Kingpin's crimes but has never been able to prove his involvement.

Eventually, Fisk is legally detained thanks to Matt Murdock's work where the FBI has rounded up those involved with his plot.

In [[Daredevil (season 2)|season two]], Fisk uses Frank Castle as a pawn to dispose an [[Ray Schoonover (comics)|underground drug ring]] so the [[Punisher]] could dispose of any rival gangsters, and uses a [[Big Ben Donovan|major lawyer]] as a [[consigliere]]. In [[Daredevil (season 3)|season three]], the Kingpin is released from prison via a deal to be a criminal informant for the FBI.

Thus, Kingpin is one of Spider-Man's oldest foes and the two have fought several times over the last eight years, but Spider-Man and the police were never able to gain the evidence necessary to expose Fisk as a criminal and arrest him. Like in the comics, Kingpin is portrayed as being a powerful fighter, just as good as he is a criminal mastermind, and, according to [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], he easily defeated Spider-Man during their very first confrontation, slashing him with a [[katana]] from his artifacts collection. In the very first mission of the game, Spider-Man takes part in a police operation to arrest Fisk, as they finally gained enough evidence to expose him for the criminal he truly is. Breaking into Fisk Industries, Spider-Man battles numerous of Kingpin's goons and stops them from erasing crucial incriminatory evidence, before confronting Fisk in his office. After Spider-Man destroys his last line of defense, Kingpin battles the web-slinger himself, destroying several floors in the process, but Spider-Man eventually defeats Fisk and webs him up to the ceiling, just as the police break into the building. Kingpin is subsequently arrested and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains, but, before he is taken away, Fisk angrily declares that Spider-Man will regret putting him away, as he was the only one keeping the city's gangs under control. This soon proves to be true, as crime rates quickly skyrockets after Kingpin's downfall and the Inner Demons, led by [[Mister Negative]], begin to seize his territories, sparking a gang war. Despite being locked up, Fisk continues to maintain a number of fronts throughout the city, allowing him to continue earning money to finance his criminal empire; Spider-Man helps the police find and dismantle these operations, leading Fisk to swear revenge on the hero. Kingpin is also mentioned in at least three side missions, with one involving Spider-Man thwarting his scheme to steal citizens' personal information for profit and the other two involving plans by Fisk's men to break him out of prison and/or destroy the evidence against him. Hitmen employed by Fisk will occasionally attack Spider-Man while he is travelling through the city.\n* There are two playable versions of Kingpin (\"Wilson Fisk\" and \"Spider-Verse\") in the match-three mobile game ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dinh |first=Christine |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/this-week-in-marvel-games-your-favorite-marvel-games-swing-into-the-spider-verse|title=This Week in Marvel Games: Your Favorite Marvel Games Swing Into the Spider-Verse|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Theater===\nIn the play ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', Fisk is seen robbing a bank with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] before being thwarted by Spider-Man.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=850|title=Kingpin}}\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Kingpin Kingpin] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/kingpin.html Kingpin's Profile at Spiderfan.org]\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingpin}}\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Sr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Daredevil (Marvel Comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional hapkido practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional judoka]]\n[[Category:Fictional jujutsuka]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional sumo wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Hydra agents]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional supervillian}}\n{{Other uses|Kingpin (disambiguation){{!}}Kingpin}}\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=[[File:Kingpinm.png|250px]]\n|caption=Kingpin drawn by [[David Mazzucchelli]]\n|character_name= Kingpin\n|real_name=Wilson Grant Fisk\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50 (July 1967)\n|creators=[[Stan Lee]] (writer)<br>[[John Romita Sr.]] (artist)\n|homeworld=[[New York City]]\n|aliases=The Brainwasher<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #59-61</ref><br>Harold Howard{{issue|date=February 2016}}\n|alliances=[[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]<br>[[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]]<br>[[Emissaries of Evil]]<br>Power Elite\n|powers=\n*Master armed/unarmed combatant\n*Criminal mastermind/tactician \n*Peak human strength and durability\n*Wears Kevlar armor\n*Use of a laser gun-equipped cane and a hollow-on-the-inside ornamental diamond stick-pin filled with sleeping gas\n|partners=[[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Mariana Fisk]]\n}}\nThe '''Kingpin''' ('''Wilson Fisk''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

He was eventually discovered by crimelord Don Rigoletto, and became the man's bodyguard and right-hand man. Eventually, Fisk killed his boss and took control of the gangster's criminal empire, becoming one of the most powerful figures in New York's underworld.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #-1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he had made enemies such as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime syndicate and the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. The two groups teamed together to oppose Fisk, causing him to flee to [[Japan]]. There, he started a [[spice]] business in order to regain his wealth. After earning enough money, Fisk returned to New York and started gang wars in an attempt to bring down the Maggia. With the criminal world in chaos, Fisk was able to step in and take back control.{{issue|date=January 2015}}\n\nFisk attempted a coalition of the New York mobs after hearing that Spider-Man had apparently gone out of action and ordered the abduction of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but was foiled by [[Spider-Man]] in his first confrontation with the web-slinger.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50-52. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile Fisk was a powerful crimelord, he posed as a legitimate businessman, one who made donations to [[charitable organization|charities]], and seemed like a generous, wealthy man. He eventually met and then married a woman named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]], with whom he had a son: [[Richard Fisk]]. Vanessa did not know that Fisk was a criminal when they married. Vanessa (having found out) threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. He retired from crime, and the family moved back to Japan.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #170-171. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nRichard did not find out that his father was a criminal until [[college]]. After graduating, Richard told his parents he would travel through [[Europe]]. Only months later, they received news that Richard (who was angry after learning the truth about his father) had died in a [[ski|skiing accident]]. However, it turned out that Richard was still alive and masqueraded as a rival crimelord known as the Schemer, intent on toppling his father as the Kingpin of Crime.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #83-85\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83-85.

His wife Vanessa was then kidnapped by said lieutenants who put out a contract on his life. After he witnessed Vanessa's apparent death, he returned to a life of crime. He regained control of the New York mobs because he had built them up in the first place and knew how to damage them; promises to keep the East Coast stable kept Midwestern crimelords happy and allowed him room to move. The Kingpin also gained [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s loyalty by promising steady work. The files were taken by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]; the Kingpin encouraged Daredevil to turn them over to the police as that would allow him to replace the arrested crimelords that much swifter. Daredevil did not turn them over because this would slow down the Kingpin's plans.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170-172 (May\u2013June 1981).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Kingpin learned Daredevil's secret identity through information passed on from [[Karen Page]], Daredevil's ex-girlfriend who was now a pornographic film actress. The Kingpin used his influence to [[Daredevil: Born Again|destroy]] Matt Murdock's civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with Daredevil. This led to (among other events) brutalizing the reporter [[Ben Urich]], having his employees (such as [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] and [[Felix Manning]]) assaulting bribed policeman [[Nick Manolis]] and sending the homicidal patriot [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] into Hell's Kitchen. The last incident killed dozens of people, and the Kingpin was implicated. Though he avoided prison, his reputation was destroyed.<ref>''Daredevil: Born Again'' / ''Daredevil'' #227-233 (February\u2013August 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nKingpin was sought out by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (who was dating Spider-Man at the time) and feared a lack of powers would make the woman a liability to him. Black Cat paid Fisk to have scientists provide defensive bad luck powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempts to harm Black Cat in combat but also hurt and eventually kill anyone who stays nearby. The Kingpin hoped this would lead to Spider-Man's death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately broke up instead. Shortly after, Fisk was attacked by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100 (March 1985).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFisk subsequently begins his own cable television station, partnering with an apparent Texas millionaire that the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the millionaire was actually bait planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from [[Nick Fury]], Daredevil spread the word through the underworld that the Kingpin had become a stooge of HYDRA, weakening his power. HYDRA steals the vast majority of his assets, bombs his businesses across New York City, and sends a helicopter gunship to attack his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery at Manhattan's [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Bailed out of jail by a rival who intends to use him as an errand boy, Fisk loses what remains of his sanity, murders his rival, and becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #297-300.

He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent \"Murdock Papers\" that Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. government is hard-pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil's DNA.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #79 (January 2006).

This results in [[Aunt May|May Parker]] being gravely wounded by a sniper's attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts the Kingpin in prison and badly beats him in front of his fellow inmates. Spider-Man decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld.

He makes a deal with the Runaways to secure a mysterious object for him in exchange for protection from the government. He and his army of ninjas are defeated when the Runaways refuse to give it to him after stealing the object, discovering what Fisk wanted was a device invented by the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]].

But the vigilante [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] acted first, taking control of the local gangs and kidnapped the Owl who also relocated to San Francisco. He transformed Owlsley into a super-computer capable of taking control of all wifi signals in order to locate his former girlfriend [[Julia Carpenter]]. During this time, Daredevil confirmed his secret identity, taking a positive approach to it this time and moved to San Francisco to practice law and continue his superhero career. Fisk began to make moves against both of his enemies, hiring the assassin Ikari to kidnap Foggy and Matt's new girlfriend, Kirsten McDuffie, and having his men look for Julia to have leverage against the Shroud. However, the Shroud and Daredevil came into conflict when he and Jubua Pride, the Owl's daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Daredevil's law practice's clients. Daredevil went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Matt Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public. However, Fisk went with his original plan instead and Ikari kidnapped Nelson and Kirsten. Meanwhile, the Shroud, Pride, and Daredevil crashed when they attempted to get Julia at an airport, allowing Kingpin's goons to take her. Fisk presented his hostages when Daredevil confronted him and had him fight Ikari to the death, with Fisk killing one of them if Daredevil wins. The fight took them to the streets, where the Shroud saved Daredevil and killed Ikari. Improvising, Daredevil took Ikari's costume and claimed to have killed the hero while the Shroud had the Owl bring to light all of Fisk's operations in exchange for his freedom.

With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' ''them'', prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire.

Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight [[sumo|sumo wrestler]], or some [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifters]] and [[Powerlifting|powerlifters]] but at greater strength levels. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #69, Marvel Comics</ref> Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling. His signature move is the [[bear hug]]. He has fought [[Captain America]] to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\"Captain America' 1972\"/> His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands;<ref>''Daredevil'' #170, Marvel Comics</ref> he stores his valuables in a safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171, Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHe typically wears [[Kevlar]] armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries an \"obliterator cane\", a walking stick that conceals a laser weapon that can vaporize a handgun or a person's head at close range. He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals compressed sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed into a victim's face.

Thus, Kingpin is one of Spider-Man's oldest foes and the two have fought several times over the last eight years, but Spider-Man and the police were never able to gain the evidence necessary to expose Fisk as a criminal and arrest him. Like in the comics, Kingpin is portrayed as being a powerful fighter, just as good as he is a criminal mastermind, and, according to [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], he easily defeated Spider-Man during their very first confrontation, slashing him with a [[katana]] from his artifacts collection. In the very first mission of the game, Spider-Man takes part in a police operation to arrest Fisk, as they finally gained enough evidence to expose him for the criminal he truly is. Breaking into Fisk Industries, Spider-Man battles numerous of Kingpin's goons and stops them from erasing crucial incriminatory evidence, before confronting Fisk in his office. After Spider-Man destroys his last line of defense, Kingpin battles the web-slinger himself, destroying several floors in the process, but Spider-Man eventually defeats Fisk and webs him up to the ceiling, just as the police break into the building. Kingpin is subsequently arrested and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains, but, before he is taken away, Fisk angrily declares that Spider-Man will regret putting him away, as he was the only one keeping the city's gangs under control. This soon proves to be true, as crime rates quickly skyrockets after Kingpin's downfall and the Inner Demons, led by [[Mister Negative]], begin to seize his territories, sparking a gang war. Despite being locked up, Fisk continues to maintain a number of fronts throughout the city, allowing him to continue earning money to finance his criminal empire; Spider-Man helps the police find and dismantle these operations, leading Fisk to swear revenge on the hero. Kingpin is also mentioned in at least three side missions, with one involving Spider-Man thwarting his scheme to steal citizens' personal information for profit and the other two involving plans by Fisk's men to break him out of prison and/or destroy the evidence against him. Hitmen employed by Fisk will occasionally attack Spider-Man while he is travelling through the city.\n* There are two playable versions of Kingpin (\"Wilson Fisk\" and \"Spider-Verse\") in the match-three mobile game ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dinh |first=Christine |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/this-week-in-marvel-games-your-favorite-marvel-games-swing-into-the-spider-verse|title=This Week in Marvel Games: Your Favorite Marvel Games Swing Into the Spider-Verse|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Theater===\nIn the play ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', Fisk is seen robbing a bank with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] before being thwarted by Spider-Man.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=850|title=Kingpin}}\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Kingpin Kingpin] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/kingpin.html Kingpin's Profile at Spiderfan.org]\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Black Cat}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingpin}}\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Sr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Daredevil (Marvel Comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional hapkido practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional judoka]]\n[[Category:Fictional jujutsuka]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional sumo wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Hydra agents]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n", "name_user": "Itzcoalt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(character)"}

The Etruscan wolf has been described as a small wolf-like dog. The Etruscan wolf is accepted as the ancestor of ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' that is the ancestor of the [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus'').<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Canis etruscus 4.JPG|thumb|left|Incomplete mounted skeleton, Museo di Paleontologia di Firenze]] \nThe [[fossil record]] for ancient [[vertebrates]] is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/> Several species of [[Caninae]] from the Pleistocene of Europe have been described. Most of their [[Systematics|systematic]] and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationships have not been resolved because of their similar morphology.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\nUpper [[Valdarno]] is the name given to that part of the [[Arno]] valley situated in the provinces of [[Florence]] and [[Arezzo]], Italy. The region is bounded by the [[Pratomagno]] mountain range to the north and east and by the Chianti mountains to the south and west. The Upper Valdarno Basin has provided the remains of three fossil canid species dated to the Late [[Villafranchian]] era of Europe 1.9-1.8 million years ago that arrived with a faunal turnover around that time. The Swiss paleontologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (''[[Canis falconeri]]'' Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as ''Lycaon falconeri'', and the smaller Etruscan wolf (''C. etruscus'' Forsyth Major 1877).<ref name=lucenti2016/> Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf,<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, [[jackal]]-sized species.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> This he named the [[Canis arnensis|Arno River dog]]<ref name=lucenti2016/> (''C. arnensis'' Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby [[Arno]] river.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n===Type Specimen===\n[[File:Canis etruscus restoration.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition]]\nThe [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno.

The French archaeologist Jean-Philip Brugal proposes ''C. mosbachensis'' as a subspecies of ''C. etruscus'',<ref name=brugal2011/> and another French archaeologist [[Henry de Lumley]] considers ''C. mosbachensis'' to be a subspecies of the gray wolf and proposes a classification of ''C. lupus mosbachensis''.<ref name=lumley1988/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\nThe dispersal of carnivoran species occurred approximately 1.8 million years ago and this coincided with a decrease in precipitation and an increase of annual seasonality which followed the 41,000 year amplitude shift of [[Milankovitch cycles]]. First to arrive was ''C. etruscus'', which was immediately followed by ''C. arnensis'' and ''Lycaon falconeri'', and then the giant hyena ''[[Pachycrocuta]] brevirostris''. These were all better adapted to open, dry landscapes than the two more primitive canini ''[[Eucyon]]'' and ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' that they replaced in Europe.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nA description of the Etruscan wolf appears below:\n<blockquote>Medium-sized dog (average size of a small ''C. lupus''); elongated snout; marked constriction of the snout beyond the infraorbital foramina; elongated nasal bones extending beyond the maxillofrontal suture; well-developed sagittal and nuchal crests; laterally enlarged occipital region; P1-P2-P3 laterally compressed; P1 with lingual cingulum; P3 normally with both posterior and accessory cusp (=modified posterior cingulum); large relative length of the upper molar row (in comparison with ''C. arnensis''); M1 with paracone more elevated than metacone; labial basin of M1 as deep as but larger than the lingual one; M1 and M2 with a continuous cingulum; reduced contact area between M1 and\nM2.

The Etruscan wolf has been described as a small wolf-like dog. The Etruscan wolf is accepted as the ancestor of ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' that is the ancestor of the [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus'').<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Canis etruscus 4.JPG|thumb|left|Incomplete mounted skeleton, Museo di Paleontologia di Firenze]] \nThe [[fossil record]] for ancient [[vertebrates]] is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/> Several species of [[Caninae]] from the Pleistocene of Europe have been described. Most of their [[Systematics|systematic]] and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationships have not been resolved because of their similar morphology.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\nUpper [[Valdarno]] is the name given to that part of the [[Arno]] valley situated in the provinces of [[Florence]] and [[Arezzo]], Italy. The region is bounded by the [[Pratomagno]] mountain range to the north and east and by the Chianti mountains to the south and west. The Upper Valdarno Basin has provided the remains of three fossil canid species dated to the Late [[Villafranchian]] era of Europe 1.9-1.8 million years ago that arrived with a faunal turnover around that time. The Swiss paleontologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (''[[Canis falconeri]]'' Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as ''Lycaon falconeri'', and the smaller Etruscan wolf (''C. etruscus'' Forsyth Major 1877).<ref name=lucenti2016/> Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf,<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, [[jackal]]-sized species.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> This he named the [[Canis arnensis|Arno River dog]]<ref name=lucenti2016/> (''C. arnensis'' Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby [[Arno]] river.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n===Type Specimen===\n[[File:Canis etruscus restoration.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition]]\nThe [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno. It is housed in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum. The specimen has been designed as lectotype by the Italian paleontologist Danilo Torre in 1967 from the sample described by Forsyth Major.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n===''Canis apolloniensis''===\nOne specimen of ''C. apolloniensis'' (Koufos and Kostopoulos 1997) was found in site of Apollonia-1 near the village of Nea Apollonia, Macedonia, in northern Greece. The holotype consists of the rostral portion of a skull and a mandible. In 2011, a study compared all of the fifty-five [[Early Pleistocene]] wolf-like specimens found across Europe and suggested that their morphometric variation was no different to that of modern wolf populations with their difference in size representing male and female specimens. However, the study proposed two lineages. One lineage is ''[[Canis arnensis|C. arnensis]]'' which includes ''C. accitanus'' and ''C. senezensis'', and the other lineage being ''C. etruscus'' that includes ''C. apolloniensis''.<ref name=brugal2011/> Other studies<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mart\u00ednez-Navarro, B., Belmaker, M., Bar-Yosef, O., 2009.|first=|date=|title=The large carnivores from \u2018Ubeidiya (early Pleistocene, Israel): biochronological and biogeographical implications.|url=|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=56|pages=514-524|doi=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.02.004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartolini Lucenti, S., Alba, D.

By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in [[Yangyuan County]], [[Hebei]], China and Kuruksay, Tajikistan.<ref name=vislobokova2003/> In Europe, ''C. etruscus'' first appeared 1.9-1.8 million years ago.<ref name=lucenti2016/> The lineage from ''C. etruscus'' to the [[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|Mosbach wolf]] (''C. mosbachensis'' Soergel, 1925) to the [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus'') is widely accepted in the European scientific literature.<ref name=kurten1968/><ref name=sotnikova2010/><ref name=torre1967/><ref name=torre1974/><ref name=torre1979/><ref name=martin1973/><ref name=sotnikova1989/><ref name=rook1993/><ref name=sotnikova2001/> Nevertheless a recent publication<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartolini Lucenti|first=Saverio|last2=Bukhsianidze|first2=Maia|last3=Mart\u00ednez-Navarro|first3=Bienvenido|last4=Lordkipanidze|first4=David|date=2020|title=The wolf from Dmanisi and Augmented Reality: review, implications and opportunities|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.00131/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Earth Science|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/feart.2020.00131|issn=2296-6463}}</ref> has challenged this well-established hypothesis showing that the peculiarity of the ''C. etruscus'' (as shown by Cherin et al., 2014<ref name=\"cherin2014\" />) do not fit with those of more modern Early Pleistocene canids like ''C. borjgali'' from [[Dmanisi]], probably the ancestor wolf-like crown-clade species (''[[Wolf|C. lupus]]'', ''[[Coyote|C. latrans]]'', ''[[African golden wolf|C. lupaster]]''). The French archaeologist Jean-Philip Brugal proposes ''C. mosbachensis'' as a subspecies of ''C. etruscus'',<ref name=brugal2011/> and another French archaeologist [[Henry de Lumley]] considers ''C. mosbachensis'' to be a subspecies of the gray wolf and proposes a classification of ''C. lupus mosbachensis''.<ref name=lumley1988/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\nThe dispersal of carnivoran species occurred approximately 1.8 million years ago and this coincided with a decrease in precipitation and an increase of annual seasonality which followed the 41,000 year amplitude shift of [[Milankovitch cycles]]. First to arrive was ''C. etruscus'', which was immediately followed by ''C. arnensis'' and ''Lycaon falconeri'', and then the giant hyena ''[[Pachycrocuta]] brevirostri''. These were all better adapted to open, dry landscapes than the two more primitive canini [[Eucyon]] and [[Nyctereutes]] that they replaced in Europe.<ref name=cherin2014/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nA description of the Etruscan wolf appears below:\n<blockquote>Medium-sized dog (average size of a small ''C. lupus''); elongated snout; marked constriction of the snout beyond the infraorbital foramina; elongated nasal bones extending beyond the maxillofrontal suture; well-developed sagittal and nuchal crests; laterally enlarged occipital region; P1-P2-P3 laterally compressed; P1 with lingual cingulum; P3 normally with both posterior and accessory cusp (=modified posterior cingulum); large relative length of the upper molar row (in comparison with ''C. arnensis''); M1 with paracone more elevated than metacone; labial basin of M1 as deep as but larger than the lingual one; M1 and M2 with a continuous cingulum; reduced contact area between M1 and\nM2.
