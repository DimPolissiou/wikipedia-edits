It was sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s [[Lord Northcliffe]] and featured the famous Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]]. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''BBC'' p. 47</ref>  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.<ref>Asa Briggs, p. 50</ref>\n\nBut by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests<ref>Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], ''[[Power Without Responsibility]]'', (Routledge) p. 110</ref> and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.<ref>Asa Briggs, pp. 50, 97</ref> Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd.]] [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 110</ref> [[L.

Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\" signifying that England had been saved.<ref>Crook, Tim (2002). \"International Radio Journalism\". Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, [[Jean Seaton]], Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\"/> Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 118</ref>\n\nThe BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925\u201326) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n===1927 to 1939===\n[[File:Radio Times 1931 (masthead).jpg|thumb|left|Masthead from the edition of 25 December 1931 of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', including the BBC motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\"]]\n[[File:John Logie Baird in 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] (seen here in 1917) televised the BBC's first drama, ''[[The Man with the Flower in His Mouth]]'', on 14 July 1930, and the first live outside broadcast, [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], on 2 June 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021180342/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC's first television outside broadcast|url=http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|publisher=Prospero|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009223351/http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith \u2013 newly knighted \u2013 was appointed its first Director General.

The annual message typically chronicles the year's major events.]]\nThe success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, such as Bill and Ben the flowerpot men, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]]. Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service (now named the [[BBC Television#History of BBC Television|BBC Television Service]]) started from [[Alexandra Palace]] in 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic [[405 line]] Marconi-EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year.<ref>{{cite book |author=Norman, Bruce |title=Here's Looking at You: The Story of British Television 1908\u20131939 |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/hereslookingatyo0000norm/page/99 99] |isbn=978-0-563-20102-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/hereslookingatyo0000norm/page/99 }}</ref>\n\n===1939 to 2001===\n[[File:George Orwell statue - BBC London (38562767202).jpg|thumb|[[Statue of George Orwell]] outside [[Broadcasting House]], headquarters of the BBC.

Concerts were broadcast from the Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in [[St Paul's Church, Bedford]] was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[William Temple (bishop)|York]] came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and all parts of the world on the National Day of Prayer.

In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of [[divestment]] by [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] and selling parts of its organisation.

The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] to become a live radio station, following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.\n\n===2000 to 2011===\nIn 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. [[BBC Knowledge]] was replaced by [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]], for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.\n\n[[File:Manchester big screen.jpg|thumb|left|England fans in [[Manchester]] during a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game shown on the [[BBC Big Screen]]]]\nThe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] was replaced by [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].

Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and/or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] as well as on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; [[BBC Radio 4]], focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.\n\nIn addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.\n\n[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations \u2013 [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally.

It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.\n\nThe company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel [[BBC Entertainment]] shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Studios channels [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] (Joint venture with [[Corus Entertainment]]) showing similar programming in the North America region and [[BBC UKTV]] in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international [[CBeebies]] channel and [[BBC Kids]], a joint venture with [[Knowledge Network|Knowledge Network Corporation]], which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels [[BBC Knowledge (international)|BBC Knowledge]], broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and [[BBC Lifestyle]], broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Studios runs an international version of the channel [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]], and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.\n\nBBC Studios also distributes the 24-hour international news channel [[BBC World News]]. The station is separate from BBC Studios to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Studios.

In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TVNZ 1]].\n\nIn addition to programming, BBC Studios produces material to accompany programmes.

It was sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s [[Lord Northcliffe]] and featured the famous Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]]. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''BBC'' p. 47</ref>  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.<ref>Asa Briggs, p. 50</ref>\n\nBut by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests<ref>Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], ''[[Power Without Responsibility]]'', (Routledge) p. 110</ref> and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.<ref>Asa Briggs, pp. 50, 97</ref> Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd.]] [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 110</ref> [[L.

Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\" signifying that England had been saved.<ref>Crook, Tim (2002). \"International Radio Journalism\". Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, [[Jean Seaton]], Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\"/> Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 118</ref>\n\nThe BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925\u201326) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n===1927 to 1939===\n[[File:Radio Times 1931 (masthead).jpg|thumb|left|Masthead from the edition of 25 December 1931 of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', including the BBC motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\"]]\n[[File:John Logie Baird in 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] (seen here in 1917) televised the BBC's first drama, ''[[The Man with the Flower in His Mouth]]'', on 14 July 1930, and the first live outside broadcast, [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], on 2 June 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021180342/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC's first television outside broadcast|url=http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|publisher=Prospero|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009223351/http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith \u2013 newly knighted \u2013 was appointed its first Director General.

The annual message typically chronicles the year's major events.]]\nThe success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]].

The BBC moved much of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford.  Concerts were broadcast from the Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in [[St Paul's Church, Bedford]] was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[William Temple (bishop)|York]] came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and all parts of the world on the National Day of Prayer.

In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of [[divestment]] by [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the [[Hulton Press Library]], a photographic archive which had been acquired from the ''[[Picture Post]]'' magazine by the BBC in 1957.

The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] to become a live radio station, following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.\n\n===2000 to 2011===\nIn 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. [[BBC Knowledge]] was replaced by [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]], for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.\n\n[[File:Manchester big screen.jpg|thumb|left|England fans in [[Manchester]] during a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game shown on the [[BBC Big Screen]]]]\nThe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] was replaced by [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].

Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and/or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] as well as on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; [[BBC Radio 4]], focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.\n\nIn addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.\n\n[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations \u2013 [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally.

It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.\n\nThe company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel [[BBC Entertainment]] shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Studios channels [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] (Joint venture with [[Corus Entertainment]]) showing similar programming in the North America region and [[BBC UKTV]] in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international [[CBeebies]] channel and [[BBC Kids]], a joint venture with [[Knowledge Network|Knowledge Network Corporation]], which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels [[BBC Knowledge (international)|BBC Knowledge]], broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and [[BBC Lifestyle]], broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Studios runs an international version of the channel [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]], and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.\n\nBBC Studios also distributes the 24-hour international news channel [[BBC World News]]. The station is separate from BBC Studios to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Studios.

In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TVNZ 1]].\n\nIn addition to programming, BBC Studios produces material to accompany programmes.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Prince Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.\u00a0 Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement \n| name           = Delwara\n| other_name     = \n| settlement_type = Sub-Tehsil\n| image_skyline   = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname = \"Devkul Patan Nagri\"\n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = Delwara\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|24.7752|N|73.7463|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{IND}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Rajsamand district|Rajsamand]]\n| established_date        = 224-215 BC\n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = \n| leader_name             = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| elevation_m             = 586\n| population_total        = 4429\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes=<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/</ref>\n| population_density_km2  = \n| literacy_rate = 76.7\n| demographics_type1     = Languages\n| demographics1_title1   = Official\n| demographics1_info1    = [[Hindi]]\n| demographics1_title2   = {{no wrap|Additional Official}}\n| demographics1_info2    = [[English language|English]]\n| demographics1_title3   = Regional\n| demographics1_info3   = [[Mewari language|Mewari]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 313202\n| area_code               = +91- 2952\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| registration_plate      = RJ-30\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest Places \n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Udaipur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajsamand]], [[Haldighati]], [[Kumbhalgarh]], [[Chittorgarh]]\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|BSh]]\n|}}\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\n<br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\n<br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar?

Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders.

He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== The seat of learning ===\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== The grandeur of Jain temples ===\n<br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, the minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]]. These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]).\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\n<br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref><br>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya,his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Muhammad Bin Tughluk brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near Mandalgarh. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=autogenerated2>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar?

In \"Sleep\" all he wanted to do is to rest his sleepy head, but the other Alphablocks had other plans in mind.\n|-\n| F\n| Purple and white with orange visor || She is into floating and blowing. She is designed like an astronaut with a small life-support backpack. She can fly about in the air or in outer space. Her 'ffff' sound is used to represent the sound of a rocket-pack attached to her.\n|-\n| G \n| Green || She looks like a plant with flowers on her sides and grassy hair. Sometimes she drinks water, and when that happens her hair grows. \n|-\n| H \n| Yellow and red || She likes to run, but she can get tired when running. Her 'h-h-h-h' sound is panting.\n|-\n| I \n| Magenta || Her singing can be too loud sometimes but the Alphablocks really like her singing. She is also self-absorbed and thinks she is the most important letter (reflecting the use of 'I' to refer to oneself, or the first person).\n|-\n| J \n| Blue and white with orange 'beak' || She looks like a penguin, but thinks she is a jay bird. She thinks she can sing and fly like a real jay.\n|-\n| K \n| Yellow, with a green jersey and red trousers || He likes to kick his ball. Sometimes he cooperates with his because the hard C makes the same sound as K. \n|-\n| L \n| Lavender pink with green <nowiki/>boots || She loves to sing songs with her 'luh-luh-luh' sound. She sings a special lullaby to help the others get to sleep.\n|-\n| M \n| White with blue feet || He is dressed up as a chef and likes to eat things (even things that are not food) which makes him quite greedy. This can annoy the other Alphablocks. \n|-\n| N \n|| Vermilion || He is quite stubborn and negative. He says \"No\" even if he means yes. In \"Ants\", A, P, T, and S were blaming him for nothing, which made him very upset. In \"Little Red N\" he faced a challenge when the dog, the cat, and the pig refused to help him make bread out of wheat. In \"Band\", he plays an N-shaped electric guitar.\n|-\n| O \n| Orange || He does not speak, only being able to make his \"o\" sounds, but he likes to investigate lots of things with his magnifying glass.\n|-\n| P \n| Bright green, blue and purple with white stars and dark green pointed shoes || She can appear and disappear by making a popping noise and it can scare the others when they are busy. She appears to be a pixie. She is very sweet and loves to help her friends.\n|-\n| Q\n| Teal with indigo hair || She is an old green woman who dresses like a queen and wants to be quite quarreling. She is also in love with U, which is who she also needs to make her 'qu' or 'q' sound, but he always runs away. \n|- \t\n| R \n| Red and black || She looks like a pirate (reflecting the stereotypical \"arrrrrr\" pirate exclamation), and she has a tomboy personality. She has a habit of trilling the \"R\"s]] in her words.\n|-\n| S \n| Red, white, blue, orange, green, and yellow || She resembles a beach ball. She can inflate and deflate and fly about. In \"Clap\" she became depressed when she questioned her status as a letter, because she makes the same sound as soft C.\n|-\n| T \n|Navy blue || He wears a monocle and has a white mustache. He really likes drinking tea. He says \"t, t\" when he is out of tea. He is one of the consonants who appears a lot.\n|-\n| U \n| Light blue with blue shoes || He wears square glasses and is quite moody. He always runs away from Q. He usually says words like \"unfair\" or \"unbelievable\". \n|-\n| V \n| Red and white || He is a racing driver who is very fast with his steering wheel and has feathers on his arms. His 'v-v-v' sound is his \"vroom\".\n|-\n| W \n|Dark blue || He cries when he gets hurt or when he is upset, causing floods everywhere. His 'w-w-w' sound is wailing. He refers to his name as his sound.\n|-\n| X \n| Yellow and blue with white boots and red cape || He is a superhero called The Exciting X who has x-ray vision. In \"Plusman\", he became Plusman when he accidentally hit his head on the ceiling, causing his letter shape to go all wonky and turn into a plus sign, and he turned red with a different personality. He then had the power to make compound words - putting two words together into one. In the same episode, he showed how he became Plusman with his laser by rotating his X the same way his letter shape did and made the compound word \"lunchbox\".\n|-\n| Y \n| Yellow || He is the youngest Alphablock. He perseveres even if he has trouble doing things.\n|-\n| Z \n|Lime green with silver beard || He is the oldest Alphablock who wears a medal and carries a walking stick. He can sleep almost anywhere (reflecting the \"zzz\" sound commonly used to represent the sound of sleeping or snoring in comic books).\n|}\n\n==Other characters==\n*Birthday Girl\n*Cow Boy\n*Singing Cow\n*Puppy\n*Cat\n*Rats\n*Bats\n*Dog\n*Sheep\n*Sheep Dog\n*Rams\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series overview===\n{{Series overview\n|color1 = 528762\n|start1 = 2011\n|end1 = 2019\n|episodes1 = 144\n|link1=#Volume 1: Phonics First Steps (2010)}}\n===Volume 1: Phonics First Steps (2010)===\nVolume 1 originally ran in the UK from January to February 2010.<ref name=tvdb>{{cite web|url=http://thetvdb.com/?tab=series&id=138481|title=Alphablocks|publisher=tvdb}}</ref>\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n{{ordered list|start=1\n | Alphablocks (Letters from A-Z)\n | Taps (S, A, T and P)\n | In (I and N)\n | Man (Letter M)\n | Din (letter D)\n | Dog (Letter G)\n | Kick (Letters C and K)\n | Cat (CVC words with A)\n | Dot (Letter O and why I has her dot)\n | Pen (CVC words with E)\n | Up (CVC words with U)\n | Red (Letter R)\n | Hen (Letter H)\n | Bop (Letter B)\n | Top (B_G)\n | Fred (Letter F)\n | Lips (vowels)\n | Hill (Digraphs SS, LL and FF)\n}}\n{{colend}}\n\n===Volume 2: Phonics Next Steps (2011)===\nVolume 2 originally ran in the UK from February to March 2011.<ref name=tvdb/>\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n# Van (Letters J and V)\n# Web (Letters W and X)\n# Wig (CVC words with I)\n# Rainbow (CVC words with O)\n# Zap (Letters Y and Z)\n# Box (various words)\n# Quick (Letter Q)\n# On (All 26 letters)\n# ABC (The Alphabet Song)\n# The Cat Sat on the Mat (_AT)\n# Wish (_UG)\n# Snowman (_AN)\n# Win (CVC words with all the vowels)\n# Hat (_AP)\n# Little Red N (CVC words with all the vowels)\n# Odd (nonsense words)\n{{colend}}\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cz0vd/episodes/2012 |title=Episodes from Alphablocks: Series 2 broadcast in 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Volume 3: Letter Teams (2012)===\nVolume 3 originally aired from October 2012 to January 2013\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n# Champ (Digraphs CH and SH)\n# Song (Digraph NG)\n# Thing (Digraph TH)\n# Train (Digraph AI)\n# Sail (Digraph AI)\n# Beep (Digraph EE)\n# Tightrope (Trigraph IGH)\n# Toad (Digraph OA)\n# Book (Digraph OO)\n# Moon (Digraph OO)\n# Hey!
