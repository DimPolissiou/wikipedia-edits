Seeds or pebbles were placed inside, presumably for performing complex arithmetic calculations. The first of these tables was found in 1869 in the province of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]] ([[Ecuador]]) and prompted systematic studies of these objects. All [[archaeological]] examples are very different from each other.<ref name=\"RDP\">Radicati di Primeglio, [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bibvirtualdata/libros/2008/estud_quipu/cap03.pdf \"Il sistema contabile degli Inca: Yupana e Quipu\"], 1979</ref>\n* '''yupana of Poma de Ayala''': a picture on page 360 of [[El primer nueva cor\u00f3nica y buen gobierno]], written by the [[chronicler]] of the Indies [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]], represents a 5x4 [[chessboard]].<ref name=\"GPA\">Guaman Poma de Ayala, [http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm \"Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno\", 1615]</ref> The picture, although having some similarities with the majority of table-yupana, presents several differences from these. Notably, the trays are rectangular, while those of table-yupanas are [[polygons]] of varying shape.\n\nAlthough very different from each other, most of the scholars who have dealt with table-yupana, have then extended its reasoning and theories to the yupana of Poma de Ayala and vice versa, perhaps in an attempt to find a unifying thread or a common method. The Nueva Coronica was discovered only in 1916 in the [[library]] of [[Copenhagen]] and that part of the studies on it were based on previous studies and theories regarding table-yupanas.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n==History==\n\nSeveral chroniclers of the Indies described, unfortunately approximately, the Incan abacus and its operation.\n\n===Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala===\n\nThe first was Guaman Poma de Ayala that in 1615 approximately, wrote:\n\n{{quote|... They count through tables, numbering from one hundred thousand to one hundred and from ten thousand and ten, until the unit. They keep records of everything that happens in this realm: holidays, Sundays, months and years. These accountants and treasurers of the kingdom are found in every city, town, or indigenous village ...|<ref name=\"GPA\" />}}\n\nIn addition to providing this brief description, Poma de Ayala draws a picture of the yupana: a board of five rows and four columns in which are designed a series of white and black circles.\n\n===Jos\u00e9 de Acosta===\n\nThe father [[Jesuit]] ''Jos\u00e9 de Acosta'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|... they take the corn and put one here, three there, eight from another part; they move from a box and exchanged three other grains from one to another to finally get the result without error|<ref name=\"ACO\">Jos\u00e9 de Acosta - Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias - Libro VI cap XVIII (De los memoriales y cuentas que usaron los Indios del Per\u00fa)</ref>}}\n\n===Juan de Velasco===\n\nFather ''Juan de Velasco'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|... these teachers were using something like a series of tables, made of wood, stone, or clay, with different separations, in which they put stones of different shapes, colors and angular shapes|<ref name=\"VEL\">Juan Velasco - \u201cHistoria del Reino de Quito\u201d - 1841 44, Tomo II, 7</ref>}}\n\n==Table-yupana==\n\n===Chordeleg===\n\nThe earliest known example of a table-yupana was found in 1869 in [[Chordeleg]], [[Azuay Province]], [[Ecuador]]. It is a [[rectangular]] table (33x27 cm) of [[wood]] consisting of 17 compartments, of which 14 are [[square]], 2 are [[rectangular]], and one is [[octagonal]]. On two edges of the table there are other square compartments (12x12 cm) raised and symmetrically arranged one another, to which two square platforms (7x7 cm), are overlapped. These structures are called towers. The table presents a symmetry of the compartments with respect to the [[diagonal]] of the [[rectangle]]. The four sides of the board are also engraved with figures of human heads and a [[crocodile]].<ref name=\"RDP\" /> As a result of this discovery, [[Charles Wiener]] began in 1877 a systematic study of these objects. Wiener came to the conclusion that the table-yupanas served to calculate the [[taxes]] that farmers paid to the Incan empire.\n\n===Caraz===\n\nFound at [[Caraz]] in 1878 - 1879, this table-yupana is different from that of Chordeleg as the material of construction is the [[stone]] and the central compartment of octagonal shape is replaced with a rectangular one; towers also have three shelves instead of two.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas===\n\nA series of table-yupanas much different from the first, was described by [[Erland Nordenski\u00f6ld]] in 1931. These yupana, made of stone, present a series of rectangular and square compartments. The tower is composed of two rectangular compartments. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the smaller side of the table.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Triangular yupana===\n\nThese yupana, made of stone, have 18 compartments of triangular shape, arranged around the table. On one side there is a rectangular tower with only one floor and three triangular compartments. In the central part there are four square compartments, coupled between them.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Chan Chan===\n\nIdentical to the yupana of Chordeleg, both for the material and the arrangement of the compartments, this table-yupana was found in the archaeological complex of [[Chan Chan]] in [[Peru]] in 1967.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===C\u00e1rhua de la Bah\u00eda===\n\nDiscovered in the province of [[Pisco]] ([[Peru]]), these table-yupanas are two tables in [[clay]] and [[bone]]. The first is rectangular (47x32 cm), has 22 square (5x5 cm) and three rectangular (16x18 cm) compartments, and has no towers. The second is rectangular (32x23 cm) containing 22 square compartments, two L-shaped and three rectangular in the center. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the longer side.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Huancarcuchu===\n\nDiscovered in the upper [[Ecuador]] by [[Max Uhle]] in 1922, this yupana is made of stone and its bins are drawn. It has the shape of a scale consisting of 10 overlapping rectangles: four on the first floor, three on the second, two in the third and one in the fourth. This yupana is the one that is closest to the picture by Poma de Ayala in Nueva Coronica, while having a line less and being half drawn.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Florio===\n\nC. Florio presents a study <ref name=\"FLO2\">[https://www.academia.edu/12063847/Recovering_memory_the_INCA_KEY_as_YANANTIN C. Florio, \"Recovering memory - The Inca Key as Yanantin\"]</ref>\nwhich does not identify a yupana in these archaeological findings, but an object whose name is unknown and which has been forgotten. Instead, this object is to connect to the tocapu (an ideogram already used by pre-Incas civilizations) called \u201cllave inca\u201d (i.e. Inca key) and to the [[Yanantin|yanantin-masintin]] philosophy. The scholar reaches this conclusion starting from the lack of objective evidences which recognize a yupana in this object, a belief that consolidated over years only for the repeat of this hypothesis never demonstrated, and by crossing data from the Miccinelli Documents and the tocapu(s) catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. \n<gallery>\nImage: Teoria Florio su yupana a casetta - B.png|Fig. A - Structure of a \u201cChordeleg\u201d table-yupana.

A), C. Florio identifies a drawing (fig. B) very similar to a really existing tocapu (fig. C) and catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. In addition, in the tocapu reported in figure D, also catalogued by V. de la Jara, Florio identifies a stylization of the tocapu C and the departure point for creating the tocapu \u201cllave inca\u201d (Inca key). She finds the relation between the table-yupana and the Inca key also in their connection with the concept of duality: the table-yupana structure is clearly dual and Blas Valera in \u201cExul Immeritus Blas Valera populo suo\u201d (one of the two Miccinelli Documents) describes the tocapu we call Inca key as representing the concept of the \u201copposite forces\u201d and the \u201cnumber 2\u201d, both strictly linked to the concept of duality.\n\nAccording to C. Florio, the real yupana used by the Incas is that of Gu\u00e1man Poma, but with more columns and rows. Gu\u00e1man Poma would have represented just the part of the yupana useful for carrying out a specific calculation, which Florio identifies to be a multiplication (see below).\n\n==Theories of Yupana Poma de Ayala==\n\n===Henry Wassen===\n\nIn 1931, [[Henry Wassen]] studied the yupana of Poma de Ayala, proposing for the first time a possible representation of the numbers on the board and the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. He interpreted the white circles as gaps, carved into yupana in which to insert the seeds described by chroniclers: so the white circles correspond to empty gaps, while the blacks circles correspond to the same gaps filled with a black seed.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\nThe numbering system at the base of the abacus was positional notation in base 10 (in line with the writings of the chroniclers of the Indies).\n\nThe representation of the numbers, then followed a vertical progression such that the units were positioned in the first row from the bottom, in the second the tens, hundreds in the third, and so on.\n\nWassen proposed a progression of values of the seeds that depends on their position in the table: 1, 5, 15, 30, respectively, depending on who occupy a gap in the first, second, third and fourth columns (see the table below). Only a maximum of five seeds could be included in a box belonging to the first column, so that the maximum value of said box was 5, multiplied by the power of the corresponding line. These seeds could be replaced with one seed of the next column, useful during arithmetic operations. According to the theory of Wassen, therefore, the operations of sum and product were carried out horizontally.\n\nThis theory received a lot of criticism due to the high complexity of the calculations and was therefore considered inadequate and soon abandoned.\n\nBy way of example, the following table shows the number 13457.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; background:transparent\"\n| align=\"left\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana by Wassen\n!|Powers\\Values||1||5||15||30\n|-\n!|10<sup>4</sup>\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>3</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>2</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>1</sup>\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>0</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|}\nRepresentation of 13457\n|}\n\nThis first interpretation of the yupana of Poma de Ayala was the starting point for the theories developed by subsequent authors, up to the present day. In particular, no one ever moved away from the positional numbering system until 2008.\n\n===Emilio Mendizabal===\n\n[[Emilio Mendizabal]] was the first to propose in 1976 that the [[Inca]] were using, as well as the decimal representation, also a representation based on the progression 1,2,3,5. Mendizabal in the same publication pointed out that the series of numbers 1,2,3 and 5, in the drawing of Poma de Ayala, are part of the [[Fibonacci sequence]], and stressed the importance of \"magic\" that had the number 5 for civilization the [[north]] of [[Peru]], and the number 8 for the civilizations of the [[south]] of [[Peru]].<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Radicati di Primeglio===\n\nIn 1979, [[Carlos Radicati di Primeglio]] emphasized the difference of table-yupana from that of Poma de Ayala, describing the state of the art of the research and theories advanced so far. He also proposed the [[algorithms]] for calculating the four basic [[arithmetic operations]] for yupana of Poma de Ayala, according to a new interpretation for which it was possible to have up to nine seeds in each box with vertical progression for powers of ten.<ref name=\"RDP\" /> The choice of Radicati was to associate to each gap a value of 1.\n\nIn the following table is represented the number 13457\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; background:transparent\"\n| align=\"left\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana by Radicati\n!|Powers\\Values||1||1||1||1\n|-\n!|10<sup>4</sup>\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>3</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>2</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>1</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>0</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n|}\nRepresentation of 13457\n|}\n\n===William Burns Glynn===\n\nIn 1981, the English textile [[engineer]] [[William Burns Glynn]] proposed a positional base 10 solution for the yupana of Poma de Ayala.<ref name=\"WBG\">William Burns Glynn, [http://www.boletindelima.com/1981-11.htm \"Calculation table of the Incas\"], ''Bol. Lima No. 11'', 1981, 1-15.</ref>\n\nGlynn, as Radicati, adopted the same Wassen's idea of full and empty gaps, as well as a vertical progression of the powers of ten, but proposed an architecture that allowed to greatly simplify the arithmetic operations.\n\nThe horizontal progression of the values of the seeds in its representation is 1, 1, 1 for the first three columns, so that in each row is possible to deposit a maximum of ten seeds (5 + 3 + 2 seeds). Ten seeds of any row is correspond to a single seed of the upper line.\n\nThe last column is dedicated to the ''memory'', which is a place where you can drop momentarily ten seeds, waiting to move them to the upper line. According to the author, this is very useful during arithmetic operations in order to reduce the possibility of error.\n\nThe solution of Glynn has been adopted in various teaching projects all over the world, and even today some of its variants are used in some [[schools]] of [[South America]].<ref name=\"MRV\">[http://cursa.ihmc.us/rid=1J2NH8QTM-2912G6-PZ5/yupana_como_herramienta_pedagogica.pdf Mora & Valero \"La Yupana come strumento pedagogico alle elementari\"]</ref><ref name=\"FIO\">[http://www.seminariodidama.unito.it/fiorentino.pdf Fiorentino, \"La yupana elettronica: uno strumento per la didattica interculturale della matematica\"]</ref>\n\nIn the following table is represented the number 13457\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; background:transparent\"\n| align=\"left\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana di Glynn Burns\n!|Potenze\\Valori||1||1||1||Memoria\n|-\n!|10<sup>4</sup>\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>3</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>2</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>1</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>0</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|}\n|}\n\n===Nicolino de Pasquale===\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]] [[Nicolino de Pasquale]] in 2001 proposed a positional solution in base 40 of the yupana of Poma de Ayala, taking the representation theory of [[Fibonacci]] already proposed by [[Emilio Mendizabal]] and developing it for the four operations.\n\nDe Pasquale also adopts a vertical progression to represent numbers by powers of 40. The representation of the numbers is based on the fact that the sum of the values of the circles in each row gives as total 39, if each circle takes the value 5 in the first column, 3 in the second column, 2 in the third and 1 in the fourth one; it is thus possible to represent 39 numbers, united to [[neutral element]] ( [[zero]] or no seeds in the table); this forms the basis of 40 symbols necessary for the numbering system.<ref name=\"DP1\">N.

The sequence of numbers 1,2,3,5 would be casual, contingent to the calculation done and not related to the Fibonacci series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana by Florio\n!|Product||Multiplicator||Multiplicator||Multiplicand\n|-\n!| ||3X||2X||\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\n|-\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\u2022\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\n|-\n!| 151(160)||96||64||32\n|}\n\nKey: \u25e6 = 10; \u2022 = 1; The operation represented is: 32 x 5 = 32 x (2 + 3) = (32 x 2) + (32 x 3) = 64 + 96 = 160\n\nThe numbers represented in the columns are, from left to right: 32 (the multiplicand), 64 = 32 x 2 and 32 x 3 = 96 (which together constitute the multiplicand, multiplied by the two factors in which the multiplier has been broken down) and finally 151. In this issue (error) are based all possible criticisms of this interpretation, since 151 is obviously not the sum of 96 and 64. Florio, however, notes that a mistake of Poma de Ayala, in designing a black circle instead of a white one, would have been possible. In this case, changing just a black circle with a white one in the last column, we obtain the number 160, which is exactly the product sought as the sum of the quantities present in the central columns.\n\nWith a yupana as the one designed by Poma de Ayala can not be represented every multiplicands, but it is necessary to extend the yupana vertically (adding rows) to represent numbers whose sum of digits exceeds 5. The same thing goes for the multipliers: to represent all the numbers is necessary to extend the number of columns. Apart from the supposed error calculation  (or representation by the designer), is the only one that identifies in the yupana of Poma de Ayala a mathematical and consistent message (multiplication) and not a series of random numbers as in other interpretations.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Quipu]]\n* [[Inca]]\n* [[Inca Empire]]\n* [[Numbering System]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/77966.html Gilsdorf - Ethnomathematics of the Inkas]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2hTyfurOH8AC&pg Heliane Seline - Mathematics through cultures]\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Inca_mathematics.html O'Connor & Robertson - Mathematics of the Incas]\n\n===Chroniclers of the Indies===\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm Poma de Ayala - El Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno]\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/historia-natural-y-moral-de-las-indias--0/html/ Jos\u00e9 De Acosta - Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias]\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0033193.pdf Velasco - Historia del reyno de Quito del America del Sur]\n\n===Theory by Wassen and table-Yupana===\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bibvirtualdata/libros/2008/estud_quipu/cap03.pdf Radicati di Primeglio - El sistema contable de los Incas: Yupana y Quipu]\n\n===Theory by Glynn Burns and school projects===\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://cursa.ihmc.us/rid=1J2NH8QTM-2912G6-PZ5/yupana_como_herramienta_pedagogica.pdf Mora & Valero - La Yupana come strumento pedagogico alle elementari]\n* [http://nasgem.rpi.edu/files/4092 Leonard & Shakiban - The Incan Abacus]\n* {{in lang|it}} [http://www.seminariodidama.unito.it/fiorentino.pdf Fiorentino - La yupana elettronica: uno strumento per la didattica interculturale della matematica]\n\n===Theory by De Pasquale===\n\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://matematica.unibocconi.it/articoli/la-matematica-nelle-civilt%C3%A0-pre-colombiane Universit\u00e0 Bocconi di Milano - La Matematica nelle civilt\u00e0 pre-colombiane]\n*{{in lang|en}}[http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/ancient/AncientRepublish_1036168.htm Incan counting system as easy as 1,2,3,5 - by Rossella Lorenzi]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://it.geocities.com/newsarcheo/precolombiane4.htm Notizie sulla numerazione Inca e sulla yupana]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://www.margheritacampaniolo.it/matematica_inca.htm Un italiano scopre l'enigma della matematica inca]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://www.ingegneripescara.it/old/_contenuti/archivio/2002/rassegna_2002.htm Il Sole 24 Ore Domenica 10 Novembre 2002 \u2013 N. 308 \u2013 Pagina 35 - di Antonio Aimi - SCIENZA E FILOSOFIA Matematica precolombiana Scoperto il metodo di calcolo degli Inca]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_K8aa26UngiU/SEXI6P-odEI/AAAAAAAABQI/OqPjrzw84rY/s1600-h/yupane.jpg L'unione Sarda - I numeri della natura nella scacchiera degli Inca - di Andrea Mameli]\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://www.quipus.it/gpg/index.html \"Guaman Poma Game, by N.

Seeds or pebbles were placed inside, presumably for performing complex arithmetic calculations. The first of these tables was found in 1869 in the province of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]] ([[Ecuador]]) and prompted systematic studies on these objects. All [[archaeological]] examples are very different from each other.<ref name=\"RDP\">Radicati di Primeglio, [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bibvirtualdata/libros/2008/estud_quipu/cap03.pdf \"Il sistema contabile degli Inca: Yupana e Quipu\"], 1979</ref>\n* '''yupana of Poma de Ayala''': a picture on page 360 of [[El primer nueva cor\u00f3nica y buen gobierno]] written by the [[chronicler]] of the Indies [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]], representing a 5x4 [[chessboard]].<ref name=\"GPA\">Guaman Poma de Ayala, [http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm \"Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno\", 1615]</ref> The picture, although having some similarities with the majority of table-yupana, presents several differences from these, first of all, the shape of the boxes ([[rectangles]]), when those of table-yupanas are [[polygons]] of varying shape.\n\nAlthough very different from each other, most of the scholars who have dealt with table-yupana, have then extended its reasoning and theories to the yupana of Poma de Ayala and vice versa, perhaps in an attempt to find a unifying thread or a common method. The Nueva Coronica was discovered only in 1916 in the [[library]] of [[Copenhagen]] and that part of the studies on it were based on previous studies and theories regarding table-yupanas.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n==History==\n\nSeveral chroniclers of the Indies described, unfortunately approximately, the Incan abacus and its operation.\n\n===Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala===\n\nThe first was Guaman Poma de Ayala that in 1615 approximately, wrote:\n\n{{quote|... They count through tables, numbering from one hundred thousand to one hundred and from ten thousand and ten, until the unit. They keep records of everything that happens in this realm: holidays, Sundays, months and years. These accountants and treasurers of the kingdom are found in every city, town, or indigenous village ...|<ref name=\"GPA\" />}}\n\nIn addition to providing this brief description, Poma de Ayala draws a picture of the yupana: a board of five rows and four columns in which are designed a series of white and black circles.\n\n===Jos\u00e9 de Acosta===\n\nThe father [[Jesuit]] ''Jos\u00e9 de Acosta'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|... they take the corn and put one here, three there, eight from another part; they move from a box and exchanged three other grains from one to another to finally get the result without error|<ref name=\"ACO\">Jos\u00e9 de Acosta - Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias - Libro VI cap XVIII (De los memoriales y cuentas que usaron los Indios del Per\u00fa)</ref>}}\n\n===Juan de Velasco===\n\nFather ''Juan de Velasco'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|... these teachers were using something like a series of tables, made of wood, stone, or clay, with different separations, in which they put stones of different shapes, colors and angular shapes|<ref name=\"VEL\">Juan Velasco - \u201cHistoria del Reino de Quito\u201d - 1841 44, Tomo II, 7</ref>}}\n\n==Table-yupana==\n\n===Chordeleg===\n\nThe earliest known example of a table-yupana was found in 1869 in [[Chordeleg]], [[Azuay Province]], [[Ecuador]]. It is a [[rectangular]] table (33x27 cm) of [[wood]] consisting of 17 compartments, of which 14 are [[square]], 2 are [[rectangular]], and one is [[octagonal]]. On two edges of the table there are other square compartments (12x12 cm) raised and symmetrically arranged one another, to which two square platforms (7x7 cm), are overlapped. These structures are called towers. The table presents a symmetry of the compartments with respect to the [[diagonal]] of the [[rectangle]]. The four sides of the board are also engraved with figures of human heads and a [[crocodile]].<ref name=\"RDP\" /> As a result of this discovery, [[Charles Wiener]] began in 1877 a systematic study of these objects. Wiener came to the conclusion that the table-yupanas served to calculate the [[taxes]] that farmers paid to the Incan empire.\n\n===Caraz===\n\nFound at [[Caraz]] in 1878 - 1879, this table-yupana is different from that of Chordeleg as the material of construction is the [[stone]] and the central compartment of octagonal shape is replaced with a rectangular one; towers also have three shelves instead of two.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas===\n\nA series of table-yupanas much different from the first, was described by [[Erland Nordenski\u00f6ld]] in 1931. These yupana, made of stone, present a series of rectangular and square compartments. The tower is composed of two rectangular compartments. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the smaller side of the table.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Triangular yupana===\n\nThese yupana, made of stone, have 18 compartments of triangular shape, arranged around the table. On one side there is a rectangular tower with only one floor and three triangular compartments. In the central part there are four square compartments, coupled between them.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Chan Chan===\n\nIdentical to the yupana of Chordeleg, both for the material and the arrangement of the compartments, this table-yupana was found in the archaeological complex of [[Chan Chan]] in [[Peru]] in 1967.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===C\u00e1rhua de la Bah\u00eda===\n\nDiscovered in the province of [[Pisco]] ([[Peru]]), these table-yupanas are two tables in [[clay]] and [[bone]]. The first is rectangular (47x32 cm), has 22 square (5x5 cm) and three rectangular (16x18 cm) compartments, and has no towers. The second is rectangular (32x23 cm) containing 22 square compartments, two L-shaped and three rectangular in the center. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the longer side.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Huancarcuchu===\n\nDiscovered in the upper [[Ecuador]] by [[Max Uhle]] in 1922, this yupana is made of stone and its bins are drawn. It has the shape of a scale consisting of 10 overlapping rectangles: four on the first floor, three on the second, two in the third and one in the fourth. This yupana is the one that is closest to the picture by Poma de Ayala in Nueva Coronica, while having a line less and being half drawn.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Florio===\n\nC. Florio presents a study <ref name=\"FLO2\">[https://www.academia.edu/12063847/Recovering_memory_the_INCA_KEY_as_YANANTIN C. Florio, \"Recovering memory - The Inca Key as Yanantin\"]</ref>\nwhich does not identify a yupana in these archaeological findings, but an object whose name is unknown and which has been forgotten. Instead, this object is to connect to the tocapu (an ideogram already used by pre-Incas civilizations) called \u201cllave inca\u201d (i.e. Inca key) and to the [[Yanantin|yanantin-masintin]] philosophy. The scholar reaches this conclusion starting from the lack of objective evidences which recognize a yupana in this object, a belief that consolidated over years only for the repeat of this hypothesis never demonstrated, and by crossing data from the Miccinelli Documents and the tocapu(s) catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. \n<gallery>\nImage: Teoria Florio su yupana a casetta - B.png|Fig. A - Structure of a \u201cChordeleg\u201d table-yupana.

A), C. Florio identifies a drawing (fig. B) very similar to a really existing tocapu (fig. C) and catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. In addition, in the tocapu reported in figure D, also catalogued by V. de la Jara, Florio identifies a stylization of the tocapu C and the departure point for creating the tocapu \u201cllave inca\u201d (Inca key). She finds the relation between the table-yupana and the Inca key also in their connection with the concept of duality: the table-yupana structure is clearly dual and Blas Valera in \u201cExul Immeritus Blas Valera populo suo\u201d (one of the two Miccinelli Documents) describes the tocapu we call Inca key as representing the concept of the \u201copposite forces\u201d and the \u201cnumber 2\u201d, both strictly linked to the concept of duality.\n\nAccording to C. Florio, the real yupana used by the Incas is that of Gu\u00e1man Poma, but with more columns and rows. Gu\u00e1man Poma would have represented just the part of the yupana useful for carrying out a specific calculation, which Florio identifies to be a multiplication (see below).\n\n==Theories of Yupana Poma de Ayala==\n\n===Henry Wassen===\n\nIn 1931, [[Henry Wassen]] studied the yupana of Poma de Ayala, proposing for the first time a possible representation of the numbers on the board and the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. He interpreted the white circles as gaps, carved into yupana in which to insert the seeds described by chroniclers: so the white circles correspond to empty gaps, while the blacks circles correspond to the same gaps filled with a black seed.<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\nThe numbering system at the base of the abacus was positional notation in base 10 (in line with the writings of the chroniclers of the Indies).\n\nThe representation of the numbers, then followed a vertical progression such that the units were positioned in the first row from the bottom, in the second the tens, hundreds in the third, and so on.\n\nWassen proposed a progression of values of the seeds that depends on their position in the table: 1, 5, 15, 30, respectively, depending on who occupy a gap in the first, second, third and fourth columns (see the table below). Only a maximum of five seeds could be included in a box belonging to the first column, so that the maximum value of said box was 5, multiplied by the power of the corresponding line. These seeds could be replaced with one seed of the next column, useful during arithmetic operations. According to the theory of Wassen, therefore, the operations of sum and product were carried out horizontally.\n\nThis theory received a lot of criticism due to the high complexity of the calculations and was therefore considered inadequate and soon abandoned.\n\nBy way of example, the following table shows the number 13457.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; background:transparent\"\n| align=\"left\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana by Wassen\n!|Powers\\Values||1||5||15||30\n|-\n!|10<sup>4</sup>\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>3</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>2</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>1</sup>\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>0</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|}\nRepresentation of 13457\n|}\n\nThis first interpretation of the yupana of Poma de Ayala was the starting point for the theories developed by subsequent authors, up to the present day.

Mendizabal in the same publication pointed out that the series of numbers 1,2,3 and 5, in the drawing of Poma de Ayala, are part of the [[Fibonacci sequence]], and stressed the importance of \"magic\" that had the number 5 for civilization the [[north]] of [[Peru]], and the number 8 for the civilizations of the [[south]] of [[Peru]].<ref name=\"RDP\" />\n\n===Radicati di Primeglio===\n\nIn 1979, [[Carlos Radicati di Primeglio]] emphasized the difference of table-yupana from that of Poma de Ayala, describing the state of the art of the research and theories advanced so far.

Ten seeds of any row is correspond to a single seed of the upper line.\n\nThe last column is dedicated to the ''memory'', which is a place where you can drop momentarily ten seeds, waiting to move them to the upper line. According to the author, this is very useful during arithmetic operations in order to reduce the possibility of error.\n\nThe solution of Glynn has been adopted in various teaching projects all over the world, and even today some of its variants are used in some [[schools]] of [[South America]].<ref name=\"MRV\">[http://cursa.ihmc.us/rid=1J2NH8QTM-2912G6-PZ5/yupana_como_herramienta_pedagogica.pdf Mora & Valero \"La Yupana come strumento pedagogico alle elementari\"]</ref><ref name=\"FIO\">[http://www.seminariodidama.unito.it/fiorentino.pdf Fiorentino, \"La yupana elettronica: uno strumento per la didattica interculturale della matematica\"]</ref>\n\nIn the following table is represented the number 13457\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; background:transparent\"\n| align=\"left\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana di Glynn Burns\n!|Potenze\\Valori||1||1||1||Memoria\n|-\n!|10<sup>4</sup>\n||\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>3</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>2</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>1</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|-\n!|10<sup>0</sup>\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u2022\u2022\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\n|}\n|}\n\n===Nicolino de Pasquale===\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]] [[Nicolino de Pasquale]] in 2001 proposed a positional solution in base 40 of the yupana of Poma de Ayala, taking the representation theory of [[Fibonacci]] already proposed by [[Emilio Mendizabal]] and developing it for the four operations.\n\nDe Pasquale also adopts a vertical progression to represent numbers by powers of 40. The representation of the numbers is based on the fact that the sum of the values of the circles in each row gives as total 39, if each circle takes the value 5 in the first column, 3 in the second column, 2 in the third and 1 in the fourth one; it is thus possible to represent 39 numbers, united to [[neutral element]] ( [[zero]] or no seeds in the table); this forms the basis of 40 symbols necessary for the numbering system.<ref name=\"DP1\">N.

The sequence of numbers 1,2,3,5 would be casual, contingent to the calculation done and not related to the Fibonacci series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Yupana by Florio\n!|Product||Multiplicator||Multiplicator||Multiplicand\n|-\n!| ||3X||2X||\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\n|-\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\u2022\n||\u25e6\n|-\n||\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u2022\u2022\n||\u2022\u2022\u2022\n||\u25e6\u25e6\n||\u2022\n|-\n!| 151(160)||96||64||32\n|}\n\nKey: \u25e6 = 10; \u2022 = 1; The operation represented is: 32 x 5 = 32 x (2 + 3) = (32 x 2) + (32 x 3) = 64 + 96 = 160\n\nThe numbers represented in the columns are, from left to right: 32 (the multiplicand), 64 = 32 x 2 and 32 x 3 = 96 (which together constitute the multiplicand, multiplied by the two factors in which the multiplier has been broken down) and finally 151. In this issue (error) are based all possible criticisms of this interpretation, since 151 is obviously not the sum of 96 and 64. Florio, however, notes that a mistake of Poma de Ayala, in designing a black circle instead of a white one, would have been possible. In this case, changing just a black circle with a white one in the last column, we obtain the number 160, which is exactly the product sought as the sum of the quantities present in the central columns.\n\nWith a yupana as the one designed by Poma de Ayala can not be represented every multiplicands, but it is necessary to extend the yupana vertically (adding rows) to represent numbers whose sum of digits exceeds 5. The same thing goes for the multipliers: to represent all the numbers is necessary to extend the number of columns. Apart from the supposed error calculation  (or representation by the designer), is the only one that identifies in the yupana of Poma de Ayala a mathematical and consistent message (multiplication) and not a series of random numbers as in other interpretations.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Quipu]]\n* [[Inca]]\n* [[Inca Empire]]\n* [[Numbering System]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/77966.html Gilsdorf - Ethnomathematics of the Inkas]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2hTyfurOH8AC&pg Heliane Seline - Mathematics through cultures]\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Inca_mathematics.html O'Connor & Robertson - Mathematics of the Incas]\n\n===Chroniclers of the Indies===\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm Poma de Ayala - El Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno]\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/historia-natural-y-moral-de-las-indias--0/html/ Jos\u00e9 De Acosta - Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias]\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0033193.pdf Velasco - Historia del reyno de Quito del America del Sur]\n\n===Theory by Wassen and table-Yupana===\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bibvirtualdata/libros/2008/estud_quipu/cap03.pdf Radicati di Primeglio - El sistema contable de los Incas: Yupana y Quipu]\n\n===Theory by Glynn Burns and school projects===\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://cursa.ihmc.us/rid=1J2NH8QTM-2912G6-PZ5/yupana_como_herramienta_pedagogica.pdf Mora & Valero - La Yupana come strumento pedagogico alle elementari]\n* [http://nasgem.rpi.edu/files/4092 Leonard & Shakiban - The Incan Abacus]\n* {{in lang|it}} [http://www.seminariodidama.unito.it/fiorentino.pdf Fiorentino - La yupana elettronica: uno strumento per la didattica interculturale della matematica]\n\n===Theory by De Pasquale===\n\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://matematica.unibocconi.it/articoli/la-matematica-nelle-civilt%C3%A0-pre-colombiane Universit\u00e0 Bocconi di Milano - La Matematica nelle civilt\u00e0 pre-colombiane]\n*{{in lang|en}}[http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/ancient/AncientRepublish_1036168.htm Incan counting system as easy as 1,2,3,5 - by Rossella Lorenzi]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://it.geocities.com/newsarcheo/precolombiane4.htm Notizie sulla numerazione Inca e sulla yupana]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://www.margheritacampaniolo.it/matematica_inca.htm Un italiano scopre l'enigma della matematica inca]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://www.ingegneripescara.it/old/_contenuti/archivio/2002/rassegna_2002.htm Il Sole 24 Ore Domenica 10 Novembre 2002 \u2013 N. 308 \u2013 Pagina 35 - di Antonio Aimi - SCIENZA E FILOSOFIA Matematica precolombiana Scoperto il metodo di calcolo degli Inca]\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_K8aa26UngiU/SEXI6P-odEI/AAAAAAAABQI/OqPjrzw84rY/s1600-h/yupane.jpg L'unione Sarda - I numeri della natura nella scacchiera degli Inca - di Andrea Mameli]\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://www.quipus.it/gpg/index.html \"Guaman Poma Game, by N.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

The leading case, ''Lynch v. Clarke''{{refn|NY Chanc.Ct., November 5, 1844; 1 Sandf.Ch. 583, 3 NY Leg.Obs. 236, 7 NY Ch. Ann. 443, 1844 WL 4804, 1844 N.Y.Misc.

Lewis H. Sandford, Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the First Circuit.|volume=1|publisher=Gould, Banks, and Co.|year=1846|page=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433009477674;view=1up;seq=597 588]}}</ref>}} of 1844, indicated that citizens born \"within the dominions and allegiance of the United States\" are citizens regardless of parental citizenship. This case dealt with a New York law (similar to laws of other states at that time) that only a U.S. citizen could inherit real estate. The plaintiff, Julia Lynch, had been born in New York while her parents, both British, were briefly visiting the U.S., and shortly thereafter all three left for Britain and never returned to the U.S. The New York Chancery Court determined that, under common law and prevailing statutes, she was a [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizen by birth]] and nothing had deprived her of that citizenship, notwithstanding that both her parents were not U.S. citizens or that British law might also claim her through her parents' [[nationality]]. In the course of the decision, the court cited the Constitutional provision and said:\n\n<blockquote>Suppose a person should be elected president who was native born, but of alien parents; could there be any reasonable doubt that he was eligible under the Constitution? I think not. The position would be decisive in his favor, that by the rule of the common law, in force when the Constitution was adopted, he is a citizen.<ref>Sandf. at 656, Leg.Obs. at 246\u2013247</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd further:\n\n<blockquote>Upon principle, therefore, I can entertain no doubt, but that by the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. It is surprising that there has been no judicial decision upon this question.<ref>Sandf. at 663, Leg.Obs. at 250</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe decision in ''Lynch'' was cited as persuasive or authoritative precedent in numerous subsequent cases, and reinforced the interpretation that \"natural born citizen\" meant born \"within the dominions and allegiance of the United States\" regardless of parental citizenship. For example, in an 1884 case, ''In re Look Tin Singg'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3556433;view=1up;seq=933|title=The Federal reporter : with key-number annotations ... Permanent ed. .. v.21.|website=HathiTrust}}</ref> the federal court held, that despite laws preventing naturalization of Chinese visitors, Chinese persons born in the United States were citizens by birth, and remained such despite any long stay in China. Citing ''Lynch'', Justice [[Stephen J. Field]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>After an exhaustive examination of the law, the Vice-Chancellor said that he entertained no doubt that every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, was a natural-born citizen, and added that this was the general understanding of the legal profession, and the universal impression of the public mind.<ref>Fed at 909, Sawyer at 359\u2013360</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Lynch'' case was also cited as a leading precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[United States v.

Happersett]]'', stated: <blockquote>\"The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that. At common-law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents.

At age 20, she contacted the American embassy in Sweden and, shortly after her 21st birthday, returned to the United States on a U.S. passport and was admitted as a U.S. citizen. Years later, while she was still in America, her father in Sweden relinquished his American citizenship, and, because of that, the Department of Labor (then the location of the [[Immigration & Naturalization Service]]) declared her a non-citizen and tried to deport her. The young woman filed suit for a declaratory judgment that she was an American citizen by birth. She won at the trial level, and at the circuit court\u2014where she was repeatedly described as \"a natural born citizen\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3381137503537572247|title=''Perkins v.

In this view, such a person should not be considered a natural born citizen, but rather a \"naturalized\" citizen who is not eligible for the Presidency.<ref name=\"CRS2016\" />\n\nIn 1951, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted in ''Zimmer v. Acheson'' that \"[t]here are only two classes of citizens of the United States, native-born citizens and naturalized citizens\", quoting a [[dictum]] by Justice Gray from ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' (1884) and ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"Gordon\" /> The court ruled that Zimmer, who was born abroad in 1905 to a U.S. citizen father and a noncitizen mother, was himself a citizen under the nationality law in force at the time of his birth, but \"his status as a citizen was that of a naturalized citizen and not a native-born citizen\".<ref name=\"ZimmervAcheson\">{{cite journal|url=http://openjurist.org/191/f2d/209/zimmer-v-acheson|title=''Zimmer v Acheson, 191 F.2d 209 (10th Cir. 1951)|volume=F2d|issue=191|pages=209|year=1951}}</ref> In the 1956 case of ''Wong Kam Wo v.

In 1940, the [[Nationality Act of 1940]] ({{usstat|54|1137}}), explicitly defined \"naturalization\" as conferring nationality ''after'' birth.\n\nIn 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''Montana v. Kennedy'' that an individual who was born in 1906 in Italy to a U.S. citizen mother and a noncitizen father was not a U.S. citizen by birth under the nationality laws in force at the time of his birth. It observed that automatic citizenship was granted to children of U.S. citizen fathers and noncitizen mothers by an 1855 act of Congress, but the reverse situation was only addressed, non-retroactively, in 1934.<ref name=\"MontanavKennedy\">{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/366/366.US.308.198.html|title=''Montana v.

The Court \"appeared to assume or imply that such persons became citizens at birth by way of naturalization\".<ref name=\"CRS2016\" />\n\nMore recent cases, particularly ''[[Nguyen v.

The court referred to the case of Wong Kim Ark, and provides a compilation of the arguments pertaining to this topic.\n\nA clarification to this interpretation was made in 2010, where a [[Judicial panel|three-judge panel]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] held that natural born citizens can lose their citizenship if their territory of birth later ceases to be U.S. territory. The case involved a Philippine-born litigant who could not claim U.S. citizenship on the basis of his parents, who lived all their lives in the Philippines, because they were born while the Philippines was U.S. territory prior to being given its independence. The Courts for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have also held that birth in the Philippines at a time when the country was a territory of the United States does not constitute birth \"in the United States\" under the Citizenship Clause, and thus did not give rise to United States citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13732685093008127861|title=''Nolos v.

In 1862, in the House of Representatives he stated:\n<blockquote>The Constitution leaves no room for doubt upon this subject. The words \"natural born citizen of the United States\" appear in it, and the other provision appears in it that, \"Congress shall have power to pass a uniform system of naturalization.\" To naturalize a person is to admit him to citizenship. Who are ''natural born citizens'' but those born within the Republic? Those born within the Republic, whether black or white, are citizens by birth\u2014natural born citizens.<ref>''Congressional Globe'' 37.2 (1862), [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=059/llcg059.db&recNum=680 p. 1639].</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe reiterated his statement in 1866:\n<blockquote>Every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural-born citizen; but, sir, I may be allowed to say further that I deny that the Congress of the United States ever had the power, or color of power to say that any man born within the jurisdiction of the United States, not owing a foreign allegiance, is not and shall not be a citizen of the United States. Citizenship is his birthright and neither the Congress nor the States can justly or lawfully take it from him.<ref>''Congressional Globe'' 39.1 (1866) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=071/llcg071.db&recNum=332 p. 1291]. Stated again during a House debate in 1872; cf. ''Congressional Globe'' 42.2 (1872), [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=104/llcg104.db&recNum=106 p. 2791].</ref></blockquote>\n\nEdward Bates also held to the belief that \"natural born\" should be interpreted as \"born in the United States\". He also indicated that those born in the United States to alien parents, even if they reside elsewhere, are still considered natural born. In 1862, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] sent a query to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edward Bates]] asking whether or not \"colored men\" can be citizens of the United States. The question arose because the Coast Guard had detained a schooner commanded by a free \"colored man\" who claimed he was a citizen of the United States. If he were a U.S. citizen the boat could be released, but otherwise\u2014the Civil War then being fought\u2014it would be confiscated. No information about the man's birth or parentage was provided. Bates responded on November 29, 1862, with a 27-page opinion \u2014 considered of such importance that the government published it not only in the official volumes of Attorney-General opinions but also as a separate booklet<ref>10 Opinions of the U.S. Atty.Gen. [pages] 382\u2013413, and separately as ''Opinion of Attorney General Bates on Citizenship'' (1863, Washington, DC, Govt. Printing Office) 27 pages.</ref> \u2014 concluding,\n\n<blockquote> I conclude that the ''free man of color'', mentioned in your letter, if born in the ''United States'', is a citizen of the United States. [italics in original]</blockquote>\n\nIn the course of that opinion, Bates commented at some length on the nature of [[citizenship]], and wrote,\n\n<blockquote>... our constitution, in speaking of ''natural born citizens'', uses no affirmative language to make them such, but only recognizes and reaffirms the universal principle, common to all nations, and as old as political society, that the people born in a country do constitute the nation, and, as individuals, are ''natural'' members of the body politic. [italics in original]</blockquote>\n\nIn another opinion, dated September 1, 1862,<ref>\"Citizenship of children born in the United States of alien parents\", 10 Op. US Atty-Gen. 328.</ref> Bates dealt with a question from the Secretary of State, of whether a person born in the U.S. to two non-citizens, who is taken with them back to their country, could, years later, re-enter the United States as of right, as a U.S. citizen. Bates wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United States of alien parents, who have never been naturalized, are native-born citizens of the United States, and, of course, do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship. I might sustain this opinion by a reference to the well-settled principle of the common law of England on this subject; to the writings of many of the earlier and later commentators on our Constitution and laws; ... and lastly to the dicta and decisions of many of our national and state tribunals. But all this has been well done by Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford, in the case of ''Lynch vs. Clarke'', and I forbear. I refer to his opinion for a full and clear statement of the principle, and of the reasons and authorities for its support. </blockquote>\n\nUnlike Edward Bates, U.S. Secretary of State [[William Learned Marcy]] was equivocal about whether those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens. In 1854 Marcy wrote [[John Y. Mason]], the U.S. Minister to France:<ref>Letter from Marcy to Mason, June 6, 1854, quoted from the manuscript, reprinted (with the emphasis shown) in John Bassett Moore, ''A Digest of International Law'' [''of the United States''], vol. 3, sec. 373, pp. 276\u2013277 (US House of Representatives, 56th Congress, 2d Session, Document no. 551; Washington, DC, Govt. Printing Office, 1906).</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In reply to the inquiry ... whether \"the children of foreign parents ''born in the United States'', but brought to the country of which the father is a subject, and continuing to reside within the jurisdiction of their father's country, are entitled to protection as citizens of the United States\", I have to observe that it is presumed that, according to the common law, any person born in the United States, unless he be born in one of the foreign legations therein, may be considered a citizen thereof until he formally renounces his citizenship. There is not, however any United States statute containing a provision upon this subject, nor, so far as I am aware, has there been any judicial decision in regard to it.</blockquote>\n\nU.S. Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]], however, shared Edward Bates' opinion that those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens, and he added that they should be entitled to be president of the United States, if elected. In 1875 Pierrepont was presented with a query from the Secretary of State, [[Hamilton Fish]]. A young man, named Arthur Steinkauler,<ref>His first name is not given in the Opinion itself but is found in the correspondence seeking the opinion, in ''Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States''  (US House of Representatives, 44th Congress, 1st Session, December 6, 1875) Exec. Doct. 1, part 1, page 563.</ref> had been born in Missouri in 1855, a year after his father was naturalized a U.S. citizen. When he was four years old, his father returned to Germany with him and both had stayed there ever since. The father had [[relinquishment of United States nationality|relinquished his U.S. citizenship]] and the young man was now 20 years old and about to be drafted into the Imperial German army. The question was asked \"What was this young man's situation as a native-born American citizen?\" After studying the relevant legal authorities, Pierrepont wrote:<ref>''Steinkauler's Case'', 15 Opinions of the US Attorneys-General 15 at 17\u201318 (June 26, 1875).</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Under the treaty [of 1868 with Germany], and in harmony with American doctrine, it is clear that Steinkauler the father abandoned his naturalization in America and became a German subject (his son being yet a minor), and that by virtue of German laws the son acquired German nationality. It is equally clear that the son, by birth, has American nationality, and hence he has two nationalities, one natural, the other acquired ... Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. There is no law of the United States under which his father or any other person can deprive him of his birthright. He can return to America at the age of 21, and in due time, if the people elect, he can become President of the United States. ... I am of opinion that when he reaches the age of 21 years he can then elect whether he will return and take the nationality of his birth, with its duties and privileges, or retain the nationality acquired by the act of his father.</blockquote>\n\n==== 1900s ====\nFrederick van Dyne, the Assistant Solicitor of the U.S. Department of State (1900\u20131907) indicated that children of citizens born outside the United States are also considered citizens. In 1904, he published a textbook, ''Citizenship of the United States'', in which he wrote:<ref>van Dyne, Frederick, ''Citizenship of the United States'' (1904, Rochester, NY, Lawyers Co-operative Publ'g Co.) pp. 3\u201312. With regard to the last sentence in the quotation, van Dyne discusses some peripheral court decisions, none dealing with conventional U.S. citizenship, but with the nationality of the child of a foreigner and a member of an independent American Indian tribe whose members were not ordinarily regarded as U.S. citizens.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>There is no uniform rule of international law covering the subject of citizenship. Every nation determines for itself who shall, and who shall not, be its citizens. ... By the law of the United States, citizenship depends, generally, on the place of birth; nevertheless the children of citizens, born out of the jurisdiction of the United States, are also citizens. ... The Constitution of the United States, while it recognized citizenship of the United States in prescribing the qualifications of the President, Senators, and Representatives, contained no definition of citizenship until the adoption of the 14th Amendment, in 1868; nor did Congress attempt to define it until the passage of the civil rights act, in 1866. ... Prior to this time the subject of citizenship by birth was generally held to be regulated by the common law, by which all persons born within the limits and allegiance of the United States were deemed natural-born citizens.\n\nIt appears to have been assumed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of ''Murray v. The Charming Betsy'' (1804) 2 Cranch (6 U.S.) 64, 119, 2 L.Ed. 208, 226, that all persons born in the United States were citizens thereof. ... In ''M'Creery v. Somerville'' (1824) 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 354, 6 L.Ed. 109, which concerned the title to land in the state of Maryland, it was assumed that children born in that state to an alien were native-born citizens of the United States. ... The Federal courts have almost uniformly held that birth in the United States, of itself, confers citizenship.</blockquote>\n\n===Academic interpretations===\n==== 1800s ====\n[[William Rawle]], formerly the U.S. Attorney for Pennsylvania (1791\u20131799)  defined ''natural born citizen'' as every person born within the United States, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. In an 1825 treatise, ''A View of the Constitution of the United States of America'', he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The citizens of each state constituted the citizens of the United States when the Constitution was adopted. ... [He] who was subsequently born the citizen of a State, became at the moment of his birth a citizen of the United States. Therefore every person born within the United States, its territories or districts, whether the parents are citizens or aliens, is a natural born citizen in the sense of the Constitution, and entitled to all the rights and privileges appertaining to that capacity. ... Under our Constitution the question is settled by its express language, and when we are informed ... no person is eligible to the office of President unless he is a natural born citizen, the principle that the place of birth creates the relative quality is established as to us.<ref>{{cite book |title = A View of the Constitution of the United States of America | last=Rawle| first=William| publisher = Philadelphia, Carey & Lea|year =1825 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=akEbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&dq=every+person+born+within+the+United+States,+its+territories+and+districts,+whether+the+parents+are+citizens+or+aliens,+is+a+natural+born+citizen+in+the+sense+of+the+Constitution,+and+entitled+to+all+the+rights+and+privileges+appertaining+to+that+capacity+A+View+of+the+Constitution+of+the+United+States+of+America&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KcxFT7XUH_HUiAKy_Jn5CA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false 80\u201381]| isbn=978-1144771858}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[James F. Wilson]] agreed with Rawle's opinion, but added the exclusion of visiting foreign diplomats. During an 1866 House debate, he quoted Rawle's opinion, and also referred to the \"general law relating to subjects and citizens recognized by all nations\", saying:\n\n<blockquote>... and that must lead us to the conclusion that every person born in the United States is a natural-born citizen of such States, except it may be that children born on our soil to temporary sojourners or representatives of foreign Governments, are native-born citizens of the United States.<ref>James F. Wilson in: ''Congressional Globe'', House of Representatives, 39th Congress, 1st Session, Washington 1866, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=071/llcg071.db&recNum=158 p. 1117].</ref></blockquote>\n\nSupreme Court Justice [[Peter Vivian Daniel]] disagreed with this position and considered ''natural born citizen'' as every person born of citizen parents within the United States. In 1857, in a concurring opinion in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'',<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=Dred Scott v.

In his 1840 guidebook to the Constitution, ''A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States'', about the natural-born-citizen clause he wrote \"It is not too much to say that no one, but a native citizen, ought ordinarily to be [e]ntrusted with an office so vital to the safety and liberties of the people.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Story|title=A familiar exposition of the Constitution of the United States: containing a brief commentary on every clause, explaining the true nature, reasons, and objects thereof: designed for the use of school libraries and general readers: with an appendix, containing important public documents, illustrative of the Constitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aew9AAAAIAAJ|year=1840|publisher=Marsh, Capen, Lyon and Webb|pages=[https://archive.org/details/afamiliarexposi02storgoog/page/n181 167] \u00a7269\u2013271}}</ref> This same wording also appeared in his 1834 work ''The constitutional class book: being a brief exposition of the Constitution of the United States: Designed for the use of the higher classes in common schools''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Story|title=The constitutional class book: being a brief exposition of the Constitution of the United States: Designed for the use of the higher classes in common schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCkTAAAAYAAJ|year=1834|publisher=Hilliard, Gray & Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalcl00stor/page/115 115] \u00a7190}}</ref>\n\n==== 1900s ====\nAlexander Porter Morse, the lawyer who represented Louisiana in ''[[Plessy v.

In the ''Albany Law Journal'', he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>If it was intended that anybody who was a citizen by birth should be eligible, it would only have been necessary to say, \"no person, except a native-born citizen\"; but the framers thought it wise, in view of the probable influx of European immigration, to provide that the president should at least be the child of citizens owing allegiance to the United States at the time of his birth. It may be observed in passing that the current phrase \"native-born citizen\" is well understood; but it is [[pleonasm]] and should be discarded; and the correct designation, \"native citizen\" should be substituted in all constitutional and statutory enactments, in judicial decisions and in legal discussions where accuracy and precise language are essential to intelligent discussion.<ref>A.P.

This same CRS report also asserts that citizens born in the [[District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], are legally defined as \"natural born\" citizens and are, therefore, also eligible to be elected president.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf|title = Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer|accessdate =January 8, 2010|date = April 17, 2000|publisher = [[Congressional Research Service]]}}</ref>\n\nThis opinion was reaffirmed in a 2009 CRS report, which stated:\n<blockquote>Considering the history of the constitutional qualifications provision, the common use and meaning of the phrase \"natural-born subject\" in England and in the Colonies in the 1700s, the clause's apparent intent, the subsequent action of the first Congress in enacting the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] (expressly defining the term \"natural born citizen\" to include a person born abroad to parents who are United States citizens), as well as subsequent Supreme Court dicta, it appears that the most logical inferences would indicate that the phrase \"natural born Citizen\" would mean a person who is entitled to [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship \"at birth\" or \"by birth\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/41197555/41131059-MoC-Memo-What-to-Tell-Your-Constituents-in-Answer-to-Obama-Eligibility|title=41131059 MoC Memo What to Tell Your Constituents in Answer to Obama Eligibility - United States Nationality Law - United States Constitution|website=Scribd}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe interpretation of natural born being the equivalent of a citizen at birth was repeated in a 2011 CRS report and a 2016 CRS report. The 2011 report stated:\n<blockquote>The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term \"natural born\" citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \"by birth\" or \"at birth,\" either by being born \"in\" the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \"at birth\".

From historical material and case law, it appears that the common understanding of the term \"natural born\" in England and in the American colonies in the 1700s included both the strict common law meaning as born in the territory (''jus soli''), as well as the ''statutory'' laws adopted in England since at least 1350, which included children born abroad to British fathers (''jus sanguinis'', the law of descent).

This case dealt with a New York law (similar to laws of other states at that time) that only a U.S. citizen could inherit real estate. The plaintiff, Julia Lynch, had been born in New York while her parents, both British, were briefly visiting the U.S., and shortly thereafter all three left for Britain and never returned to the U.S. The New York Chancery Court determined that, under common law and prevailing statutes, she was a [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizen by birth]] and nothing had deprived her of that citizenship, notwithstanding that both her parents were not U.S. citizens or that British law might also claim her through her parents' [[nationality]]. In the course of the decision, the court cited the Constitutional provision and said:\n\n<blockquote>Suppose a person should be elected president who was native born, but of alien parents; could there be any reasonable doubt that he was eligible under the Constitution? I think not. The position would be decisive in his favor, that by the rule of the common law, in force when the Constitution was adopted, he is a citizen.<ref>Sandf. at 656, Leg.Obs. at 246\u2013247</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd further:\n\n<blockquote>Upon principle, therefore, I can entertain no doubt, but that by the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. It is surprising that there has been no judicial decision upon this question.<ref>Sandf. at 663, Leg.Obs. at 250</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe decision in ''Lynch'' was cited as persuasive or authoritative precedent in numerous subsequent cases, and reinforced the interpretation that \"natural born citizen\" meant born \"within the dominions and allegiance of the United States\" regardless of parental citizenship. For example, in an 1884 case, ''In re Look Tin Singg'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3556433;view=1up;seq=933|title=The Federal reporter : with key-number annotations ... Permanent ed. .. v.21.|website=HathiTrust}}</ref> the federal court held, that despite laws preventing naturalization of Chinese visitors, Chinese persons born in the United States were citizens by birth, and remained such despite any long stay in China. Citing ''Lynch'', Justice [[Stephen J. Field]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>After an exhaustive examination of the law, the Vice-Chancellor said that he entertained no doubt that every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, was a natural-born citizen, and added that this was the general understanding of the legal profession, and the universal impression of the public mind.<ref>Fed at 909, Sawyer at 359\u2013360</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Lynch'' case was also cited as a leading precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' (1898),{{refn|''U.S. v.

Happersett]]'', stated: <blockquote>\"The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that. At common-law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5117525999793250938&q=Minor+v.+Happersett,+88+U.S.+162+(1875)&hl=en&as_sdt=800006|title=Minor v.

However, when she was about four her parents returned to Sweden taking her with them, and they stayed in Sweden. At age 20, she contacted the American embassy in Sweden and, shortly after her 21st birthday, returned to the United States on a U.S. passport and was admitted as a U.S. citizen. Years later, while she was still in America, her father in Sweden relinquished his American citizenship, and, because of that, the Department of Labor (then the location of the [[Immigration & Naturalization Service]]) declared her a non-citizen and tried to deport her. The young woman filed suit for a declaratory judgment that she was an American citizen by birth. She won at the trial level, and at the circuit court\u2014where she was repeatedly described as \"a natural born citizen\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3381137503537572247|title=''Perkins v.

In this view, such a person should not be considered a natural born citizen, but rather a \"naturalized\" citizen who is not eligible for the Presidency.<ref name=\"CRS2016\" />\n\nIn 1951, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted in ''Zimmer v. Acheson'' that \"[t]here are only two classes of citizens of the United States, native-born citizens and naturalized citizens\", quoting a [[dictum]] by Justice Gray from ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' (1884) and ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"Gordon\" /> The court ruled that Zimmer, who was born abroad in 1905 to a U.S. citizen father and a noncitizen mother, was himself a citizen under the nationality law in force at the time of his birth, but \"his status as a citizen was that of a naturalized citizen and not a native-born citizen\".<ref name=\"ZimmervAcheson\">{{cite journal|url=http://openjurist.org/191/f2d/209/zimmer-v-acheson|title=''Zimmer v Acheson, 191 F.2d 209 (10th Cir. 1951)|volume=F2d|issue=191|pages=209|year=1951}}</ref> In the 1956 case of ''Wong Kam Wo v. Dulles'', the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit quoted ''Zimmer v. Acheson'' and ''United States v. Wong Kim Ark'' in support of a ruling that the statute that was in effect prior to 1940 granting citizenship to foreign-born children of U.S. citizens was a naturalization law rather than a provision for nationality at birth. In 1940, the [[Nationality Act of 1940]] ({{usstat|54|1137}}), explicitly defined \"naturalization\" as conferring nationality ''after'' birth.\n\nIn 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''Montana v. Kennedy'' that an individual who was born in 1906 in Italy to a U.S. citizen mother and a noncitizen father was not a U.S. citizen by birth under the nationality laws in force at the time of his birth. It observed that automatic citizenship was granted to children of U.S. citizen fathers and noncitizen mothers by an 1855 act of Congress, but the reverse situation was only addressed, non-retroactively, in 1934.<ref name=\"MontanavKennedy\">{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/366/366.US.308.198.html|title=''Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308 (1961)}}</ref> In 1971, the Court encountered a similar situation in ''[[Rogers v. Bellei]]'', where the individual in question was born after 1934 and so was granted automatic U.S. citizenship, though subject to residence requirements and was subject to expatriation. The Court \"appeared to assume or imply that such persons became citizens at birth by way of naturalization\".<ref name=\"CRS2016\" />\n\nMore recent cases, particularly ''[[Nguyen v. INS]]'' and ''Robinson v. Bowen'', relaxed this view, suggesting that the Fourteenth Amendment merely establishes a \"floor\" for birthright citizenship, and this category may be expanded by Congress.<ref name=\"CRS2016\" />\n\n==== 2000s ====\nIn 2009 in ''Ankeny v.

The court referred to the case of Wong Kim Ark, and provides a compilation of the arguments pertaining to this topic.\n\nA clarification to this interpretation was made in 2010, where a [[Judicial panel|three-judge panel]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] held that natural born citizens can lose their citizenship if their territory of birth later ceases to be U.S. territory. The case involved a Philippine-born litigant who could not claim U.S. citizenship on the basis of his parents, who lived all their lives in the Philippines, because they were born while the Philippines was U.S. territory prior to being given its independence. The Courts for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have also held that birth in the Philippines at a time when the country was a territory of the United States does not constitute birth \"in the United States\" under the Citizenship Clause, and thus did not give rise to United States citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13732685093008127861|title=''Nolos v.

To this the Court responded, \"Article II, section 1, clause 5 does not state this. No legal authority has ever stated that the Natural Born Citizen clause means what plaintiff Strunk claims it says. ... Moreover, President Obama is the sixth U.S. President to have had one or both of his parents not born on U.S. soil\". The opinion then listed Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, Chester A. Arthur, Woodrow Wilson, and Herbert Hoover.<ref name=\"MyUser_Law.justia.com_January_16_2016c\" />\n\n=== Government officials' interpretations ===\n====1800s====\n[[John Bingham]], an American lawyer and politician, held to the belief that natural born should be interpreted as born in the United States. In 1862, in the House of Representatives he stated:\n<blockquote>The Constitution leaves no room for doubt upon this subject. The words \"natural born citizen of the United States\" appear in it, and the other provision appears in it that, \"Congress shall have power to pass a uniform system of naturalization.\" To naturalize a person is to admit him to citizenship. Who are ''natural born citizens'' but those born within the Republic? Those born within the Republic, whether black or white, are citizens by birth\u2014natural born citizens.<ref>''Congressional Globe'' 37.2 (1862), [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=059/llcg059.db&recNum=680 p. 1639].</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe reiterated his statement in 1866:\n<blockquote>Every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural-born citizen; but, sir, I may be allowed to say further that I deny that the Congress of the United States ever had the power, or color of power to say that any man born within the jurisdiction of the United States, not owing a foreign allegiance, is not and shall not be a citizen of the United States. Citizenship is his birthright and neither the Congress nor the States can justly or lawfully take it from him.<ref>''Congressional Globe'' 39.1 (1866) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=071/llcg071.db&recNum=332 p. 1291]. Stated again during a House debate in 1872; cf. ''Congressional Globe'' 42.2 (1872), [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=104/llcg104.db&recNum=106 p. 2791].</ref></blockquote>\n\nEdward Bates also held to the belief that \"natural born\" should be interpreted as \"born in the United States\". He also indicated that those born in the United States to alien parents, even if they reside elsewhere, are still considered natural born. In 1862, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] sent a query to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edward Bates]] asking whether or not \"colored men\" can be citizens of the United States. The question arose because the Coast Guard had detained a schooner commanded by a free \"colored man\" who claimed he was a citizen of the United States. If he were a U.S. citizen the boat could be released, but otherwise\u2014the Civil War then being fought\u2014it would be confiscated. No information about the man's birth or parentage was provided. Bates responded on November 29, 1862, with a 27-page opinion \u2014 considered of such importance that the government published it not only in the official volumes of Attorney-General opinions but also as a separate booklet<ref>10 Opinions of the U.S. Atty.Gen. [pages] 382\u2013413, and separately as ''Opinion of Attorney General Bates on Citizenship'' (1863, Washington, DC, Govt. Printing Office) 27 pages.</ref> \u2014 concluding,\n\n<blockquote> I conclude that the ''free man of color'', mentioned in your letter, if born in the ''United States'', is a citizen of the United States. [italics in original]</blockquote>\n\nIn the course of that opinion, Bates commented at some length on the nature of [[citizenship]], and wrote,\n\n<blockquote>... our constitution, in speaking of ''natural born citizens'', uses no affirmative language to make them such, but only recognizes and reaffirms the universal principle, common to all nations, and as old as political society, that the people born in a country do constitute the nation, and, as individuals, are ''natural'' members of the body politic. [italics in original]</blockquote>\n\nIn another opinion, dated September 1, 1862,<ref>\"Citizenship of children born in the United States of alien parents\", 10 Op. US Atty-Gen. 328.</ref> Bates dealt with a question from the Secretary of State, of whether a person born in the U.S. to two non-citizens, who is taken with them back to their country, could, years later, re-enter the United States as of right, as a U.S. citizen. Bates wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United States of alien parents, who have never been naturalized, are native-born citizens of the United States, and, of course, do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship. I might sustain this opinion by a reference to the well-settled principle of the common law of England on this subject; to the writings of many of the earlier and later commentators on our Constitution and laws; ... and lastly to the dicta and decisions of many of our national and state tribunals. But all this has been well done by Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford, in the case of ''Lynch vs. Clarke'', and I forbear. I refer to his opinion for a full and clear statement of the principle, and of the reasons and authorities for its support. </blockquote>\n\nUnlike Edward Bates, U.S. Secretary of State [[William Learned Marcy]] was equivocal about whether those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens. In 1854 Marcy wrote [[John Y. Mason]], the U.S. Minister to France:<ref>Letter from Marcy to Mason, June 6, 1854, quoted from the manuscript, reprinted (with the emphasis shown) in John Bassett Moore, ''A Digest of International Law'' [''of the United States''], vol. 3, sec. 373, pp. 276\u2013277 (US House of Representatives, 56th Congress, 2d Session, Document no. 551; Washington, DC, Govt. Printing Office, 1906).</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In reply to the inquiry ... whether \"the children of foreign parents ''born in the United States'', but brought to the country of which the father is a subject, and continuing to reside within the jurisdiction of their father's country, are entitled to protection as citizens of the United States\", I have to observe that it is presumed that, according to the common law, any person born in the United States, unless he be born in one of the foreign legations therein, may be considered a citizen thereof until he formally renounces his citizenship. There is not, however any United States statute containing a provision upon this subject, nor, so far as I am aware, has there been any judicial decision in regard to it.</blockquote>\n\nU.S. Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]], however, shared Edward Bates' opinion that those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens, and he added that they should be entitled to be president of the United States, if elected. In 1875 Pierrepont was presented with a query from the Secretary of State, [[Hamilton Fish]]. A young man, named Arthur Steinkauler,<ref>His first name is not given in the Opinion itself but is found in the correspondence seeking the opinion, in ''Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States''  (US House of Representatives, 44th Congress, 1st Session, December 6, 1875) Exec. Doct. 1, part 1, page 563.</ref> had been born in Missouri in 1855, a year after his father was naturalized a U.S. citizen. When he was four years old, his father returned to Germany with him and both had stayed there ever since. The father had [[relinquishment of United States nationality|relinquished his U.S. citizenship]] and the young man was now 20 years old and about to be drafted into the Imperial German army. The question was asked \"What was this young man's situation as a native-born American citizen?\" After studying the relevant legal authorities, Pierrepont wrote:<ref>''Steinkauler's Case'', 15 Opinions of the US Attorneys-General 15 at 17\u201318 (June 26, 1875).</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Under the treaty [of 1868 with Germany], and in harmony with American doctrine, it is clear that Steinkauler the father abandoned his naturalization in America and became a German subject (his son being yet a minor), and that by virtue of German laws the son acquired German nationality. It is equally clear that the son, by birth, has American nationality, and hence he has two nationalities, one natural, the other acquired ... Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. There is no law of the United States under which his father or any other person can deprive him of his birthright. He can return to America at the age of 21, and in due time, if the people elect, he can become President of the United States. ... I am of opinion that when he reaches the age of 21 years he can then elect whether he will return and take the nationality of his birth, with its duties and privileges, or retain the nationality acquired by the act of his father.</blockquote>\n\n==== 1900s ====\nFrederick van Dyne, the Assistant Solicitor of the U.S. Department of State (1900\u20131907) indicated that children of citizens born outside the United States are also considered citizens. In 1904, he published a textbook, ''Citizenship of the United States'', in which he wrote:<ref>van Dyne, Frederick, ''Citizenship of the United States'' (1904, Rochester, NY, Lawyers Co-operative Publ'g Co.) pp. 3\u201312. With regard to the last sentence in the quotation, van Dyne discusses some peripheral court decisions, none dealing with conventional U.S. citizenship, but with the nationality of the child of a foreigner and a member of an independent American Indian tribe whose members were not ordinarily regarded as U.S. citizens.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>There is no uniform rule of international law covering the subject of citizenship. Every nation determines for itself who shall, and who shall not, be its citizens. ... By the law of the United States, citizenship depends, generally, on the place of birth; nevertheless the children of citizens, born out of the jurisdiction of the United States, are also citizens. ... The Constitution of the United States, while it recognized citizenship of the United States in prescribing the qualifications of the President, Senators, and Representatives, contained no definition of citizenship until the adoption of the 14th Amendment, in 1868; nor did Congress attempt to define it until the passage of the civil rights act, in 1866. ... Prior to this time the subject of citizenship by birth was generally held to be regulated by the common law, by which all persons born within the limits and allegiance of the United States were deemed natural-born citizens.\n\nIt appears to have been assumed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of ''Murray v. The Charming Betsy'' (1804) 2 Cranch (6 U.S.) 64, 119, 2 L.Ed. 208, 226, that all persons born in the United States were citizens thereof. ... In ''M'Creery v. Somerville'' (1824) 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 354, 6 L.Ed. 109, which concerned the title to land in the state of Maryland, it was assumed that children born in that state to an alien were native-born citizens of the United States. ... The Federal courts have almost uniformly held that birth in the United States, of itself, confers citizenship.</blockquote>\n\n===Academic interpretations===\n==== 1800s ====\n[[William Rawle]], formerly the U.S. Attorney for Pennsylvania (1791\u20131799)  defined ''natural born citizen'' as every person born within the United States, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. In an 1825 treatise, ''A View of the Constitution of the United States of America'', he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The citizens of each state constituted the citizens of the United States when the Constitution was adopted. ... [He] who was subsequently born the citizen of a State, became at the moment of his birth a citizen of the United States. Therefore every person born within the United States, its territories or districts, whether the parents are citizens or aliens, is a natural born citizen in the sense of the Constitution, and entitled to all the rights and privileges appertaining to that capacity. ... Under our Constitution the question is settled by its express language, and when we are informed ... no person is eligible to the office of President unless he is a natural born citizen, the principle that the place of birth creates the relative quality is established as to us.<ref>{{cite book |title = A View of the Constitution of the United States of America | last=Rawle| first=William| publisher = Philadelphia, Carey & Lea|year =1825 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=akEbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&dq=every+person+born+within+the+United+States,+its+territories+and+districts,+whether+the+parents+are+citizens+or+aliens,+is+a+natural+born+citizen+in+the+sense+of+the+Constitution,+and+entitled+to+all+the+rights+and+privileges+appertaining+to+that+capacity+A+View+of+the+Constitution+of+the+United+States+of+America&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KcxFT7XUH_HUiAKy_Jn5CA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false 80\u201381]| isbn=978-1144771858}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[James F. Wilson]] agreed with Rawle's opinion, but added the exclusion of visiting foreign diplomats. During an 1866 House debate, he quoted Rawle's opinion, and also referred to the \"general law relating to subjects and citizens recognized by all nations\", saying:\n\n<blockquote>... and that must lead us to the conclusion that every person born in the United States is a natural-born citizen of such States, except it may be that children born on our soil to temporary sojourners or representatives of foreign Governments, are native-born citizens of the United States.<ref>James F. Wilson in: ''Congressional Globe'', House of Representatives, 39th Congress, 1st Session, Washington 1866, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=071/llcg071.db&recNum=158 p. 1117].</ref></blockquote>\n\nSupreme Court Justice [[Peter Vivian Daniel]] disagreed with this position and considered ''natural born citizen'' as every person born of citizen parents within the United States.

In the ''Albany Law Journal'', he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>If it was intended that anybody who was a citizen by birth should be eligible, it would only have been necessary to say, \"no person, except a native-born citizen\"; but the framers thought it wise, in view of the probable influx of European immigration, to provide that the president should at least be the child of citizens owing allegiance to the United States at the time of his birth. It may be observed in passing that the current phrase \"native-born citizen\" is well understood; but it is [[pleonasm]] and should be discarded; and the correct designation, \"native citizen\" should be substituted in all constitutional and statutory enactments, in judicial decisions and in legal discussions where accuracy and precise language are essential to intelligent discussion.<ref>A.P.

The 2011 report stated:\n<blockquote>The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term \"natural born\" citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \"by birth\" or \"at birth,\" either by being born \"in\" the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \"at birth\".

From historical material and case law, it appears that the common understanding of the term \"natural born\" in England and in the American colonies in the 1700s included both the strict common law meaning as born in the territory (''jus soli''), as well as the ''statutory'' laws adopted in England since at least 1350, which included children born abroad to British fathers (''jus sanguinis'', the law of descent). Legal scholars in the field of citizenship have asserted that this common understanding and legal meaning in England and in the American colonies was incorporated into the usage and intent of the term in the U.S. Constitution to include those who are citizens at birth.<ref name=\"CRS2016\">{{cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/295658863/Qualifications-for-President-and-the-Natural-Born-Citizenship-Eligibility-Requirement-Congressional-Research-Service-R42097-2016| title=Qualifications for President and the \"Natural Born\" Citizenship Eligibility Requirement| publisher =[[Congressional Research Service]] |author =Maskell, Jack | date=January 11, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{anchor|chin opinion}}[[Gabriel J.

His mother, Malvina Stone Arthur, was a native of [[Berkshire, Vermont|Berkshire]], Vermont, who moved with her family to [[Quebec]], where she met and married the future president's father, William Arthur, on April 12, 1821. After the family had settled in [[Fairfield, Vermont|Fairfield]], Vermont, somewhere between 1822 and 1824, William Arthur traveled with his eldest daughter to East Stanbridge, Canada, in October 1830 and commuted to Fairfield on Sundays to preach. \"It appears that he traveled regularly between the two villages, both of which were close to the Canada\u2013US border, for about eighteen months, holding two jobs\",<ref>Reeves, Thomas C. \"The Mystery of Chester Alan Arthur's Birthplace\", ''Vermont History'' 38, Montpelier: Vermont Historical Society, p.&nbsp;295</ref> which may well explain the confusion about Chester A.

His eligibility was questioned in a ''[[New York Tribune]]'' article, because he was born to parents of German nationality. It was stated that \"various Attorney-Generals [''sic''] of the United States have expressed the opinion that a child born in this country of alien parents, who have not been naturalized, is, by the fact of birth, a native-born citizen entitled to all rights and privileges as such.\" But due to a lack of any statute on the subject, Sch\u00fcrmann's eligibility was \"at best an open question, and one which should have made [his] nomination under any circumstances an impossibility\", because questions concerning his eligibility could have been raised after the election.<ref>\"Is Mr. Sch\u00fcrmann eligible?\", ''New York Tribune'', October 2, 1896, in: Anonymous (ed.), ''The Presidential Campaign of 1896.

Long claimed that Hughes was ineligible because his father was not yet naturalized at the time of his birth and was still a British citizen (in fact, both his parents were British citizens and never became U.S. citizens). Observing that Hughes, although born in the United States, was also (according to British law) a British subject and therefore \"enjoy[ed] a dual nationality and owe[d] a double allegiance\", Long argued that a ''native born'' citizen was not ''natural born'' without a unity of U.S. citizenship and allegiance and stated: \"Now if, by any possible construction, a person at the instant of birth, and for any period of time thereafter, owes, or may owe, allegiance to any sovereign but the United States, he is not a 'natural-born' citizen of the United States.\" <ref>Breckinridge Long (1916), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/29744612/Breckinridge-Long-A-Natural-Born-Citizen-Within \"Is Mr. Charles Evans Hughes a 'Natural Born Citizen' within the Meaning of the Constitution?\"], ''Chicago Legal News'' vol. 49, pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148 (December 7, 1916).

Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the ''Alexander romance'' and some [[recension]]s feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to [[Paradise]], journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth).\n\nThe earliest [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of the ''Alexander romance'', as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages.<ref>[[#McGinn1998|McGinn 1998]].</ref>  As the ''Alexander romance'' persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighbouring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of [[satire]], representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favour to an unrighteous ruler? This [[Problem of evil|theological need]], plus acculturation to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish [[ethnocentrism]]. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a [[Righteous among the Nations|righteous gentile]] or even a believing monotheist.<ref>[[#Jewish Encyclopedia|Broyd\u00e9 1906]].</ref>\n\nThe Christianized peoples of the [[Near East]], inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the ''Alexander romance'', further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a [[saint]]. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander ''\"the Believing King\"'', implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the ''Alexander romance'' were combined with [[Biblical]] legends such as [[Gog and Magog]].\n\nDuring the period of history during which the ''Alexander romance'' was written, little was known about the true [[historical Alexander the Great]] as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends. It was not until the [[Renaissance]] (1300\u20131600 AD) that the true history of Alexander III was rediscovered:\n\n<blockquote>Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC there has been no age in history, whether in the West or in the East, in which his name and exploits have not been familiar. And yet not only have all contemporary records been lost but even the work based on those records though written some four and a half centuries after his death, the ''[[Anabasis Alexandri|Anabasis]]'' of [[Arrian]], was totally unknown to the writers of the Middle Ages and became available to Western scholarship only with the Revival of Learning [the Renaissance].  The perpetuation of Alexander's fame through so many ages and amongst so many peoples is due in the main to the innumerable recensions and transmogrifications of a work known as the ''Alexander Romance'' or ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''.<ref name=\"Boyle 1974\">[[#Boyle1974|Boyle 1974]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Dating and origins of the Alexander legends===\n[[File:Syriac Sert\u00e2 book script.jpg|thumb|250px|An 11th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[manuscript]].

Syriac  became the vehicle of [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity]] and culture, spreading throughout [[Asia]]. Before [[Arabic]] became the dominant language, Syriac was a major language among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian communities of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Several Syriac manuscripts of the ''[[Alexander romance]]'' exist, dating from the 7th century. The [[:Category:Greek\u2013Syriac translators|Greek\u2013Syriac translators]] are generally credited with introducing the works of the ancient Greeks to pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabia]].]]\nThe legendary Alexander material originated as early as the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305 BC to 30 BC)  and its unknown authors are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]'' (not to be confused with [[Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who was Alexander's official historian). The earliest surviving manuscript of the ''Alexander romance'', called the \u03b1 ([[alpha]]) [[recension]], can be dated to the 3rd century AD and was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Alexandria]]:\n\n<blockquote>There have been many theories regarding the date and sources of this curious work [the ''Alexander romance'']. According to the most recent authority, ... it was compiled by a Greco-Egyptian writing in Alexandria about A.D. 300. The sources on which the anonymous author drew were twofold. On the one hand he made use of a `romanticized history of Alexander of a highly rhetorical type depending on the [[Cleitarchus]] tradition, and with this he amalgamated a collection of imaginary letters derived from an ''Epistolary Romance of Alexander'' written in the first century B.C. He also included two long letters from Alexander to his mother [[Olympias]] and his tutor [[Aristotle]]  describing his marvellous adventures in India and at the end of the World. These are the literary expression of a living popular tradition and as such are the most remarkable and interesting part of the work.<ref name=Brock1970/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] variants of the ''Alexander romance'' continued to evolve until, in the 4th century, the Greek legend was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius]] (where it is called the ''[[Res gestae Alexandri Magni]]'') and from Latin it spread to all major [[vernacular]] languages of [[Europe]] in the Middle Ages. Around the same as its translation into Latin, the Greek text was also translated into the [[Syriac language]] and from Syriac it spread to eastern cultures and languages as far afield as China and Southeast Asia.<ref>HANAWAY, WILLIAM L.

The Syriac legend, as it has survived, consists of five distinct manuscripts, including a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] religious legend concerning Alexander and a sermon about Alexander ascribed to the Syriac poet-theologian [[Jacob of Serugh]] (451\u2013521 AD, also called Mar Jacob), which according to Reinink was composed around 629\u2013636.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Reign of Heraclius: Crisis & Confrontation|last=Reinink |display-authors=etal |publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=35|quote=A syriac metrical homily ascribed to Jacob of Serug, the so called Alexanderlied, was composed between 629 - 636}}</ref> The Syriac Christian legend concentrates on Alexander's journey to the end of the World, where he constructs the ''[[Gates of Alexander]]'' to enclose the evil nations of ''[[Gog and Magog]]'', while the sermon describes his journey to the ''[[Land of Darkness]]'' to discover the ''[[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]'' (Fountain of Youth). These legends concerning Alexander are remarkably similar to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn found in the Quran.<ref name=stoneman2003>[[#Stoneman2003|Stoneman 2003]].</ref>\n\nOne of the five Syriac manuscripts, dated to the 18th century, has a version of the Syriac legend that has been  generally dated to between 629 AD and 636 AD. There is evidence in the legend of  \"''[[ex eventu]]'' knowledge of the [[Khazar]] invasion of [[Armenia]] in A.D. 629,\"<ref>[[#Czegledy1954|Czegl\u00e9dy 1954]].</ref><ref>[[#Czegledy1957|Czegl\u00e9dy 1957]].</ref> which suggests that the legend must have been burdened with additions by a [[redaction|redactor]] sometime around 629 AD.  The legend   appears to have been composed as [[propaganda]] in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD) shortly after he defeated the Persians in the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602\u2013628]]. It is notable that this manuscript fails to mention the Islamic conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 636 AD by [[Muhammad]]'s (570\u2013632 AD) successor, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] (590\u2013644 AD). This fact means that the legend might have been recorded before the \"cataclysmic event\"` that was the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] and the resulting [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|surrender of Jerusalem]] in November 636 AD. That the [[Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars]] would have been referenced in the legend, had it been written after 636 AD, is supported by the fact that in 692 AD a Syriac Christian adaption of the ''Alexander romance'' called the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' was indeed written as a response to the Muslim invasions and was [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] (?\u2013311 AD); this ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' equated the evil nations of ''Gog and Magog'' with the Muslim invaders and shaped the [[eschatology|eschatological]] imagination of [[Christendom]] for centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe manuscripts also contain evidence of lost texts. For example, there is some evidence of a lost pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] version of the translation that is thought to have been an intermediary between the Syriac Christian and the [[Ethiopic]] Christian translations.<ref>[[#Doufikar2003|Doufikar-Aerts 2003]].</ref> There is also evidence that the Syriac translation was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) intermediary.<ref name=Brock1970>[[#Brock1970|Brock 1970]].</ref>\n\nOne scholar (Kevin van Bladel)<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:175-203>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.175-203</ref> who finds striking similarities between the Quranic verses 18:83-102 and the Syriac legend in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]], dates the work to 629-630 AD or before Muhammad's death, not 629-636 AD.<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:178-79/> The Syriac legend matches many details in the five parts of the verses (Alexander being the two horned one, journey to edge of the world, punishment of evil doers, Gog and Magog, etc.) and also \"makes some sense of the cryptic Qur'anic story\" being 21 pages (in one edition)<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:178-79>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.178-79</ref> not 20 verses. (The sun sets in a fetid poisonous ocean\u2014not spring\u2014surrounding the earth, Gog and Magog are Huns, etc.) Van Bladel finds it more plausible that the Syriac legend is the source of the Quranic verses than vice versa, as the Syriac legend was written before the Arab conquests when the Hijazi Muslim community was still remote from and little known to the Mesopotamian site of the legend's creation, whereas Arabs worked as troops and scouts for during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] and could have been exposed to the legend.<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:189-909>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.189-90</ref>\n\n==Philological evidence==\n===Summary===\n[[Philologists]], studying ancient Christian legends about Alexander the Great, have come to conclude that the Quran's stories about Dhul-Qarnayn closely parallel certain legends about Alexander the Great found in ancient Hellenistic and Christian writings.

The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle]] of Ammon at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumours spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.<ref name=coin>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490\u2013336 bc|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382</ref><ref name=plutarch>Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]</ref> Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:\n\n<blockquote>He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ...

Amongst the artifacts excavated at this site were four silver gilded [[phalera (military decoration)|phalera]] (ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military medals). Two of the four medals are identical and depict the head of a bearded man with two horns, while the other two medals are also identical and depict the head of a clean-shaven man with two horns.

Volume 4, Number 1.</ref>\n\nAlexander has also been identified, since ancient times, with the horned figure in the [[Old Testament]] in the prophecy of [[Daniel 8]] who overthrows the kings of Media and Persia. In the prophecy, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] has a vision of a ram with two long horns and verse 20 explains that ''\"The ram which thou sawest having two horns is the kings of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]].\"'':\n\n<blockquote>[[Josephus]] [37\u2013100 AD], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xi, 8, 5 tells of a visit that Alexander is purported to have made to [[Jerusalem]], where he met the high priest Jaddua and the assembled Jews, and was shown the book of Daniel in which it was prophesied that some one of the Greeks would overthrow the empire of Persia. Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3\u20138 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ...  \"The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece.\" This identification is accepted by the church fathers ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the ''Alexander romance,'' in the sermon by [[Jacob of Serugh]], describes Alexander as having been given horns of iron by God. The legend describes Alexander (as a Christian king) bowing himself in prayer, saying:\n\n<blockquote>O God ... I know in my mind that thou hast exalted me above all kings, and ''thou hast made me horns upon my head, wherewith I might thrust down the kingdoms of the world''...I will magnify thy name, O Lord, forever ... And if the Messiah, who is the Son of God [Jesus], comes in my days, I and my troops will worship Him...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile the ''Syriac Legend'' references the horns of Alexander, it consistently refers to the hero by his Greek name, not using a variant epithet.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing| isbn = 978-1-78673-131-9| last = Zadeh| first = Travis| title = Mapping Frontiers Across Medieval Islam: Geography, Translation and the 'Abbasid Empire| date = 28 February 2017|page=241}}</ref> The use of the Islamic epithet \"Dhu al-Qarnayn\", the \"two-horned\", first occurred in the Quran.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = University of Toronto Press| isbn = 978-1-4426-4466-3| last = Faustina Doufikar-Aerts| title = Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages: Transcultural Perspectives| chapter = Coptic Miniature Painting in the Arabic Alexander Romance| date = 2016|page=169}}</ref>\n\nIn Christian Alexander legends written in [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] (an ancient [[South Semitic]] language) between the 14th and the 16th century, Alexander the Great is always explicitly referred to using the [[epithet]] the \"Two Horned.\" A passage from the Ethiopic Christian legend describes the [[Angel of the Lord]] calling Alexander by this name:\n\n<blockquote>Then God, may He be blessed and exalted! put it into the heart of the Angel to call ''Alexander 'Two-horned,' '' ... And Alexander said unto him, ' ''Thou didst call me by the name Two-horned,'' but my name is Alexander ... and I thought that thou hadst cursed me by calling me by this name.' The angel spake unto him, saying, 'O man, I did not curse thee by ''the name by which thou and the works that thou doest are known.'' Thou hast come unto me, and I praise thee because, from the east to the west, the whole earth hath been given unto thee ...'<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nReferences to Alexander's supposed horns are found in literature ranging many different languages, regions and centuries:\n\n<blockquote>The horns of Alexander ... have had a varied symbolism. They represent him as a god, as a son of a god, as a prophet and propagandist of the Most High, as something approaching the role of a messiah, and also as the champion of Allah. They represent him as a world conqueror, who subjugated the two horns or ends of the world, the lands of the rising and of the setting sun ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nFor these reasons, among others, the Quran's Arabic epithet \"Dhul-Qarnayn,\" literally meaning \"the two-horned one,\" is interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.\n\n===Alexander's Wall===\n[[File:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Iranian art|Persian]] painting from the 16th century illustrating the building of the wall with the help of the [[jinn]]]]\n\n====Early accounts of Alexander's Wall====\nThe  building of gates in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance and the wall is  known as the [[Gates of Alexander]] or the [[Caspian Gates]]. The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the [[Caspian Sea]], through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of [[Bessus]] in 329 BC, although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100 AD) mentions that:\n\n<blockquote>...a nation of the Alans, whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being [[Scythians]] ... travelled through a passage which King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates.<ref>''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'', VII, vii, Flavius Josephus</ref></blockquote>\n\nJosephus also records that the people of Magog, the Magogites, were synonymous with the Scythians.<ref>''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I, vi, Flavius Josephus</ref> According to Andrew Runni Anderson,<ref>[[#Anderson1932|Anderson 1932]].</ref> this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the Quran's revelation, not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the Quranic account. Similarly, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] (347\u2013420 AD), in his ''Letter 77'', mentions that,\n\n<blockquote>The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from [[Sea of Azov|Maeotis]] (they had their haunts between the icy [[Tanais]] and the rude [[Massagetae]], ''where the [[gates of Alexander]] keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus'').<ref>Letter 77 \"To Oceanus\", 8, Saint Jerome</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his Commentary on [[Ezekiel]] (38:2), Jerome identifies the nations located beyond the [[Caucasus mountains]] and near [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]] as Gog and Magog.  Thus the [[Gates of Alexander]] legend  was combined with the legend of [[Gog and Magog]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. It has been suggested that the incorporation of the Gog and Magog legend into the ''Alexander romance'' was prompted by the [[Hunnic Empire#Early campaigns|invasion of the Huns]] across the [[Caucasus]] mountains in 395 AD into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]].<ref>''Gog and Magog : Ezekiel 38-39 as pre-text for Revelation 19,17 and 20,7\u201310'', Sverre B\u00f8e, Mohr Siebec, 2001 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=huns+caucasus+barrier+395&source=bl&ots=OzcMrWCevB&sig=YF72Rf6ypxYmGIySA3wsAbzftBc&hl=en&ei=eq_SSsG8C5PIlAex5_SoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=huns%20caucasus%20barrier%20395&f=false see excerpt]) ({{ISBN|978-3-16-147520-7}})</ref>\n\n====Alexander's Wall in Christian legends====\n{{Main|Gates of Alexander}}\nChristian legends speak of the Caspian Gates (Gates of Alexander), also known as Alexander's wall, built by Alexander the Great in the [[Caucasus mountains]]. Several variations of the legend can be found. In the story, Alexander the Great built a gate of iron between two mountains, at the end of the [[flat Earth|Earth]], to prevent the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] from ravaging the plains. The Christian legend was written in [[Syria]] shortly before the Quran's writing and closely parallels the story of Dhul-Qarnayn.<ref>[[#Southgate1978|Southgate 1978]].</ref> The legend describes an [[apocryphal]] letter from Alexander to his mother, wherein he writes:\n\n<blockquote>I petitioned the exalted Deity, and he heard my prayer. And the exalted Deity commanded the two mountains and they moved and approached each other to a distance of twelve [[ell]]s, and there I made ... copper gates 12 ells broad, and 60 ells high, and smeared them over within and without with copper ... so that neither fire nor iron, nor any other means should be able to loosen the copper; ... Within these gates, I made another construction of stones ... And having done this I finished the construction by putting mixed tin and lead over the stones, and smearing .... over the whole, so that no one might be able to do anything against the gates. I called them the Caspian Gates. Twenty and two Kings did I shut up therein.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThese [[pseudepigraphic]] letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, describing his marvellous adventures at the end of the World, date back to the original Greek [[Alexander romance|recension \u03b1]] written in the 4th century in Alexandria. The letters are \"the literary expression of a living popular tradition\" that had been evolving for at least three centuries before the Quran was written.<ref name=\"Boyle 1974\"/>\n\n====Medieval accounts of Alexander's Wall====\n[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The wall of the citadel in [[Derbent]], Russia. Built by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] kings, it was often identified with the \"[[Gates of Alexander]]\". The [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], as well as later Caliphs, sent expeditions to Derbent to seek out this wall.]]\n\nSeveral historical figures, both Muslim and Christian, searched for Alexander's Gate and several different identifications were made with actual walls. During the [[Middle Ages]], the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'' (1254\u20131324 AD) and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. The ''Alexander romance'' identified the Gates of Alexander, variously, with the [[Pass of Dariel]], the [[Derbent|Pass of Derbent]], the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] and even the [[Great Wall of China]]. In the legend's original form, Alexander's Gates are located at the Pass of Dariel. In later versions of the Christian legends,  dated to around the time of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD), the Gates are instead located in [[Derbent]], a city  situated on a narrow strip of land between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains, where an ancient [[Sassanid]] fortification was mistakenly identified with the wall built by Alexander. In the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'', the wall in Derbent is identified with the Gates of Alexander. The [[Gates of Alexander]] are most commonly identified with the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]] whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometres between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Bretschneider1876|Bretschneider 1876]].</ref> Later historians would regard these legends as false:\n\n<blockquote>The gate itself had wandered from the Caspian Gates to the pass of Dariel, from the pass of Dariel to the pass of Derbend [Derbent], as well as to the far north; nay, it had travelled even as far as remote eastern or north-eastern Asia, gathering in strength and increasing in size as it went, and actually carrying the mountains of Caspia with it. Then, as the full light of modern day come on, the ''Alexander Romance'' ceased to be regarded as history, and with it Alexander's Gate passed into the realm of [[fairy]]land.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Andrew Runni |editor1-last= Anderson |title= Alexander's Gate, Gog and Magog, and the enclosed nations |date=January 1932  |publisher= [[Medieval Academy of America]] |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0-910956-07-9}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the Muslim world, several expeditions were undertaken to try to find and study Alexanders's wall, specifically the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]]. An early expedition to  Derbent was ordered by the Caliph [[Umar]] (586\u2013644 AD) himself, during the [[Arab conquest of Armenia]] where they heard about Alexander's Wall in Derbent from the conquered Christian Armenians. Umar's expedition was recorded by the renowned [[tafsir|exegetes of the Quran]], [[Al-Tabarani]] (873\u2013970 AD) and [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 AD), and by the Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179\u20131229 AD):\n\n<blockquote>... [[Umar]] sent ... in 22 A.H. [643 AD] ... an expedition to Derbent [Russia] ... `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah [was appointed] as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered [[Eastern Armenia|Armenia]], the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz [ruler of Armenia] informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details ...<ref name=\"Tabari\">[[Tafsir al-Tabari]], Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235\u2013239</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo hundred years later, the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Wathiq]] (?\u2013847 AD) dispatched an expedition to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain in Derbent, Russia. The expedition was led by [[Sallam-ul-Tarjuman]], whose observations were recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and by [[Ibn Kathir]]:\n\n<blockquote>...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn].<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\">Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, Yaqut al-Hamawi</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading \"Khazar\" (Caspian) he writes:\n\n<blockquote>This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (763 \u2013 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent.  Not all Muslim travellers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn's wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304\u20131369 AD) travelled to China on order of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] and he comments in his travel log that \"Between it [the city of [[Quanzhou|Zaitun]] in [[Fujian]]] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days' travel.\"<ref name=\"F.

In Islamic [[eschatology]], before the Day of Judgement Gog and Magog will destroy this gate, allowing them to ravage the Earth, as it is described in the Quran:\n\n:Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose [from their barrier], and they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise [Day of Resurrection] shall draw near [of fulfilment]. Then [when mankind is resurrected from their graves], you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror.  [They will say,] \u2018Woe to us!  We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were wrongdoers.\u2019 (Quran 21:96\u201397.

In the Christian legends, Alexander built the wall against Gog and Magog in the north, near the Caspian sea, and then went to the ends of the earth at the Paropamisadae, where it was supposed that the sun rises.]]\n\nIn the Syriac Christian legends, Alexander the Great encloses the Gog and Magog horde behind a mighty gate between two mountains, preventing Gog and Magog from invading the Earth. In addition, it is written in the Christian legend that in the [[end time]]s God will cause the Gate of Gog and Magog to be destroyed, allowing the Gog and Magog horde to ravage the Earth;\n\n<blockquote>The Lord spake by the hand of the angel, [saying] ...The gate of the north shall be opened on the day of the end of the world, and on that day shall evil go forth on the wicked ... The earth shall quake and this door [gate] which thou [Alexander] hast made be opened ... and anger with fierce wrath shall rise up on mankind and the earth ... shall be laid waste ... And the nations that is within this gate shall be roused up, and also the host of Agog and the peoples of Magog [Gog and Magog] shall be gathered together. These peoples, the fiercest of all creatures.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian Syriac legend describes a [[flat Earth]] orbited by the [[sun]] and surrounded by the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) mountains. The Paropamisadae mountains are  in turn surrounded by a narrow tract of land which is followed by a treacherous Ocean sea called [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]]. It is within this tract of land between the [[Paropamisadae]] mountains and [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] that Alexander encloses Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes \"the old wise men\" explaining this [[geography]] and [[cosmology]] of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:\n\n<blockquote>The old men say, \"Look, my lord the king, and see a wonder, this mountain which God has set as a great boundary.\" King Alexander the son of Philip said, \"How far is the extent of this mountain?\" The old men say, \"Beyond India it extends in its appearance.\" The king said, \"How far does this side come?\" The old men say, \"Unto all the end of the earth.\" And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ... The king said, \"Where have the hosts [of Gog and Magog] come forth to plunder the land and all the world from of old?\" They show him a place in the middle of the mountains, a narrow pass which had been constructed by God ...<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\n[[Flat Earth#Early Christian Church|Flat Earth beliefs in the Early Christian Church]] varied and the Fathers of the Church shared different approaches. Those of them who were more close to [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s visions, like [[Origen]], shared peacefully the belief in a [[spherical Earth]]. A second tradition, including [[St Basil]] and [[St Augustine]], accepted the idea of the round Earth and the radial gravity, but in a critical way. In particular they pointed out a number of doubts about the [[antipodes]] and the physical reasons of the radial gravity. However, a flat Earth approach was more or less shared by all the Fathers coming from the Syriac area, who were more inclined to follow the letter of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Diodore of Tarsus]] (?\u2013390 AD), [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] (6th century), and [[Chrysostom]] (347\u2013407 AD) belonged to this flat Earth tradition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Leone Montagnini, \"La questione della forma della Terra.

In his 9th century work ''[[Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam]]'', the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Christian of Stavelot]]  refers to the Khazars as [[Huns|Hunnic]] descendants of Gog and Magog, and says they are ''\"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism\"'';<ref>Kevin Alan Brook. ''The Jews of Khazaria.'' 2nd ed. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006.</ref> the Khazars were a [[Central Asia]]n people with a long association with [[Judaism]]. A [[Georgian people|Georgian]] tradition, echoed in a chronicle, also identifies the Khazars with Gog and Magog, stating they are ''\"wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts, eaters of blood.\"''<ref>Schultze (1905), p. 23.{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\nEarly Muslim scholars writing about Dhul-Qarnayn also associated Gog and Magog with the Khazars. [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 CE), the famous commentator of the Quran, identified Gog and Magog with the Khazars who lived between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] in his work ''[[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah]]'' (''The Beginning and the End'').<ref>[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Al-Bidayah wa'l-Nihayah (The Beginning and the End)''</ref><ref>Ibn Kathir, \"Stories of the Prophets\", page 54. Riyadh, SA Maktaba Dar-us-Salam, 2003</ref> The Muslim explorer [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], in his travelogue regarding his diplomatic mission in 921 AD to [[Volga Bulgars]] (a [[vassal]] of the [[khazaria|Khazarian Empire]]), noted the beliefs about Gog and Magog being the ancestors of the Khazars.<ref>''Collection of Geographical Works by Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Fadlan, Abu Dulaf Al-Khazraji'', ed. Fuat Sezgin, Frankfurt am Main, 1987</ref>\n\nThus Muslim scholars associated the Khazars with Dhul-Qarnayn just as the Christian legends associated the Khazars with Alexander the Great.\n\n===The rising place of the Sun===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}\nA peculiar aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Quran, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to \"the rising place of the Sun\" and the \"setting place of the Sun,\" where he saw the Sun sets into a murky (or boiling) spring of water (or mud). Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the \"rising place of the Sun,\" and finds that these people somehow have \"no shelter.\"\n\nIn his commentary of the Quran, [[Ibn Kathir]]  (1301\u20131373 CE) explains that verse 18:89 is referring to the furthest point that could be travelled west:\n\n<blockquote>(Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until ''he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun's setting, which is the west of the earth.'' As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he traveled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.<ref>Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Kahf 18:89, ''His traveling and reaching the Place where the Sun sets (the West)'' ([http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/7823/2/ link])</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this commentary Ibn Kathir differentiates between the end of the Earth and the supposed \"place in the sky\" where the sun sets (the \"resting place\" of the sun. Ibn Kathir contends that Dhul-Qarnayn did reach the farthest place that could be travelled west but not the \"resting place\" of the sun and he goes on to mention that the [[People of the Book]] (Jews and Christians) tell myths about Dhul-Qarnayn travelling so far beyond the end of the Earth that the sun was \"behind him.\" This shows that Ibn Kathir was aware of the Christian legends and it suggests that Ibn Kathir considered Christian myths about Alexander to be referring to the same figure as the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Qu'an.\n\nA similar theme is elaborated upon in several places in the Islamic [[hadith]] literature, in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]:\n\n<blockquote>It is narrated ... that the Messenger of Allah one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne [of Allah]. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place...<ref>Sahih Muslim 1:297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe setting place of the sun is also commented on by [[Al-Tabari]] (838-923 AD) and [[Al-Qurtubi]] (1214\u20131273 AD) and, like [[Ibn Kathir]], they showed some reservations towards the literal idea of the sun setting in a muddy spring but held to the basic theme of Dhul-Qarnayn reaching the ends of the Earth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hockney|first1=Mike|title=World, Underworld, Overworld, Dreamworld|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781326016579}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}\n\nThat the Earth must be spherical was known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]] (570\u2013495 BC), but this knowledge did not reach ancient folklore such as the ''Alexander romance'' where Alexander travels to the ends of a flat Earth. It is notable that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]] had no scientific astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy was limited to measuring time based on empirical observations of the \"rising and setting\" of the sun, moon, and particular stars. This area of astronomical study was known as ''anwa'' and continued to be developed after [[Islamization]] by the Arabs.<ref name=\"Dallal\">Dallal, Ahmad (1999), \"Science, Medicine and Technology\", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York, pg. 162</ref>  [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] began in the 8th century and the first major Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' written in 830 by [[Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b|al-Khwarizmi]].  The work is significant as it introduced the [[Ptolemaic system]] into Islamic sciences (the Ptolemaic system was ultimately replaced by the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe).\n\n====The rising place of the Sun in the Alexander legends====\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n{{Gallery\n|lines=15\n|File:Map homer world.jpg|Rendition of [[Homer]]'s view of the world (prior to 900 BC). The Homeric conception of the world involved a flat, circular Earth, surrounded by mountains and by [[Oceanus]],  the world-ocean of [[classical antiquity]], considered to be an enormous river encircling the world. The Sun emerges from underneath the Earth, travelling along the fixed dome of the sky, and is shown rising from Oceanus.\n}}</div>\n\n<blockquote> The place of his [the Sun's] rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of heaven to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves ... And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he [it] straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he [the Sun] rises ... So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea to the place where the Sun enters the window of heaven; for the Sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian legend is much more detailed than the Quran's version and elaborates at length about the [[cosmology]] of the Earth that is implied by the story:\n\n<blockquote>He [Alexander] said to them [the nobles]:  \"This thought has arisen in my mind, and I am wondering what is the extent of the earth, and how high the heavens are ... and upon what the heavens are fixed ... Now this I desire to go and see, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds all creation.\" The nobles answered and said to the king, ... \"As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heaveans rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles there is the foetid sea, [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. Men are not able to come near to this foetid sea ... Its waters are like poison and if men swim therein, they die at once.\"<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThis ancient [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of a legendary figure travelling to the end of Earth is also found in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which can be dated to c. 2000 BC, making it one of the earliest known works of literary writing.<ref name=Markaz>Sattari J., \"A study on the epic of Gilgamesh and the legend of Alexander.\" Markaz Publications 2001 (In Persian)</ref> In the [[epic poem]], in tablet nine, Gilgamesh sets out on a quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] to seek immortality. Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth where he grapples and slays monstrous mountain lions, bears and others. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises from the other world, the gate of which is guarded by two terrible scorpion-beings. They allow him to proceed through the gate after Gilgamesh convinces them to let him pass, stating his divinity and desperation, and he travels through the dark tunnel where the sun travels every night. Just before the sun is about to catch up with him, and with the North Wind and ice lashing him, he reaches the end. The world at the end of the tunnel is a bright wonderland full of trees with leaves of jewels. The 17th chapter of the apocryphal [[Book of Enoch]] describes a journey to the far west where the fire of the west receives every setting of the sun and a river of fire empties into the great western sea.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe020.htm |title = The Book of Enoch: Enoch's Journeys through the Earth and Sheol: Chapter XVII}}</ref> Chapters 72\u201380 describe the risings and settings of the sun through 12 portals of heaven in the east and west.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe075.htm |title = The Book of Enoch: The Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries: Chapter LXXII}}</ref> The myth of a flat Earth surrounded by an Ocean into which the sun sets is also found in the [[Iliad]], the famous epic poem written by [[Homer]] and dated to c. 900 BC.

He reported that in India the sun's heat is extremely intense in the morning, instead of noon being the hottest time of day. It has been argued that he based this on his belief that since India is located at the extreme east of a flat Earth, it would only be logical if the morning were unbearably hot due to the sun's proximity.<ref>How, Walter W. and Wells, J.

Alexander never marched far west of his native [[Macedon]] and his advances eastward ended at the fringes of India.]]\n\nThe Quran and the ''Alexander romance'' both have it that Dhul-Qarnayn (or Alexander) travelled a great deal. In the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn, \"God gave him unto every thing a road\" (or more literally, \"We gave him the means of everything\" 18:84) He travels as far as the ends of the Earth, to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). The Quran portrays him travelling to the \"setting of the sun.\" Muslim interpretations of these verses are varied, but classical Muslim scholars seemed to have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn's journey was real, not [[allegorical]], and that Dhul-Qarnayn's wall is also a real, physical wall somewhere on Earth.\n\nIn the Christian legends, Alexander travels to the places of the setting and rising of the Sun and this is meant to say that he travelled to the ends of the [[flat Earth]] and thus he had traversed the entire world. This legendary account served to convey the theme of Alexander's exploits as a great conqueror. Alexander was indeed a great conqueror, having ruled the largest empire in [[ancient history]] by the time he was 25 years old. However, the true historical extent of Alexander's travels are known to be greatly exaggerated in legends. For example, legend has it that upon reaching India,\n\n<blockquote>... said Alexander 'Truly, then, all the inhabited world is mine. West, north, east, south, there is nothing more for me to conquer.' Then he sat down and wept because there were not other worlds for him to conquer.<ref>[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&book=thirty&story=alexander Thirty Most Famous Stories Retold], James Baldwin (1841\u20131925)</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn reality, while Alexander did travel a great deal, he did not travel further west than [[ancient Libya]] and did not travel further east than the fringes of India. According to historians, Alexander invaded India following his desire to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea.\" However, when he reached the [[Hyphasis River]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 326 BC, his army nearly [[mutiny|mutinied]] and refused to march further east, exhausted by years of campaigning. Alexander's desire to reach \"the ends of the Earth\" was instilled by his tutor [[Aristotle]]:\n\n<blockquote>Alexander derived his concept of `Asia' from the teaching of Aristotle, for whom `the inhabited earth' was surrounded by `the Great sea' Ocean, and was divided into three areas \u2013 `Europe, Libya and Asia.' Thus the earth was not round but flat, and `Asia' was limited on the west by the [[Tanais]] (Don), the inland sea and the Nile, and on the east by `India' and `the Great Sea' ... he was mistaken in supposing that from the ridge of the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) one would see `the outer sea' and that `India' was a small peninsula running east into that sea.<ref>[[#Hammond1998|Hammond 1998]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of the world taught by Aristotle and followed by Alexander is apparent in Aristotle's ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a treatise on earth sciences where he discusses the \"length\" and \"width\" of \"the inhabited earth.\" However, Aristotle knew that the Earth is spherical and even provided observational proof of this fact. Aristotle's cosmological view was that the Earth is round but he prescribed to the notion of an \"inhabited Earth,\" surrounded by the Ocean, and an \"uninhabited Earth\" (though exactly how much of this was understood by his student Alexander the Great is not known).\n\n==Islamic depictions of Alexander the Great==\n\n===Arabic traditions===\n[[File:secret of secrets a.jpg|thumb|174px|right|Manuscript of the 9th-century Arabic work ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\"), an encyclopedic treatise on a wide range of topics including [[physiognomy]], [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[medicine]].

The Arabic manuscript was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th century and was influential in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]] ]]\n\nAlexander the Great features prominently in early Arabic literature. There are many surviving versions of the ''Alexander romance'' in Arabic that were written after the conquest of Islam. It is also thought that pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] versions of the ''Alexander romance'' may have existed.<ref name=doufikar-aertis>Doufikar-Aerts, Faustina (2003). ''The Last Days of Alexander in an Arabic Popular Romance of Al-Iskandar.'' in ''The Ancient Novel and Beyond'' by Panayotakis, Zimmerman and Keulen.</ref>\n\nThe earliest surviving Arabic narrative of the Alexander romance was composed by [[Umara ibn Zayd]] (767\u2013815 AD). In the tale, Alexander travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a   \"wonder-stone\" that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish [[Talmudic]] traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Southgate, Minoo.

In the Yemenite variation, Dhul-Qarnayn is identified with an ancient king of Yemen named [[Tubba']], rather than Alexander the Great, but the Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander's Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. The story also mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn (Tubba') visited a castle with glass walls and visited the [[Brahmins]] of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]] in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe ''Alexander romance'' also had an important influence on Arabic [[wisdom literature]]. In ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\", in Arabic ''Kitab sirr al-asrar''), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[ethics]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[medicine]], Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as [[Aristotle]]. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No [[Greek language|Greek]] original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq]] (?\u2013815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.\n\nIn another example of Arabic wisdom literature relating to Alexander, [[Ibn al-Nadim]] (?\u2013997 AD) refers to a work on [[divination]] titled ''The Drawing of Lots by Dhul-Qarnain'' and to a second work on divination by arrows titled ''The gift of Alexander'', but only the titles of these works have survived.\n\nNotably, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] (794\u2013842 AD) had ordered the translation of the ''[[Thesaurus Alexandri]]'', a work on [[elixirs]] and [[amulets]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] into Arabic. The Greek work ''Thesaurus Alexandri'' was attributed to [[Hermes]] (the great messenger of the gods in [[Greek mythology]]) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Yucesoy, Hayrettin. ''Messianic Beliefs & Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam: The Abbasid Caliphate in the Early Ninth Century''. 2009. University of South Carolina. pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nA more direct Arabic translation of the ''Alexander romance,'' called ''Sirat Al-Iskandar'', was discovered in [[Constantinople]], at the [[Hagia Sophia]], and is dated to the 13th century. This version includes the letter from Alexander to his mother about his travels in India and at the end of the World. It also includes features which occur exclusively in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The Arabic legend also retains certain [[pagan]] elements of the story, which are sometimes modified to suit the Islamic message:\n\n<blockquote>It is quite remarkable that some characteristics belonging to a pre-Islamic 'pagan' entourage, have survived in the text ... For example, Alexander orders an offering of sacrificial animals at the temple of [[Hercules]]. In the Arabic letter the name of the deity has been replaced by ''[[Allah]]'' ... Another passage in the account of the palace of Shoshan or Sus, gives a description of the large silver jars, which were alleged to have capacity of three hundred and sixty measures of wine. Alexander puts this assertion to the test, having one of the jars filled with wine and poured out for his soldiers during a banquet. This exact specification has been maintained, heedless of the Islamic ban on the use of wine ... These retouched borrowings are highly significant in this text, because the Arabic Alexander figure is portrayed as a propagator of Islamic monotheism.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/></blockquote>\n\nAnother piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the ''Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers''. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and was later translated into [[Arabic]] and expanded upon. The ''Laments of the Philosophers'' eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe:<ref name=Brock1970/>\n\n<blockquote>[The 'Sayings of the Philosophers' are] remarks of the philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander, who utter a series of [[Apophthegmata Patrum|apophthegms]] on the theme of the brevity of life and the transience of human achievement ... a work entitled 'Sayings of the Philosophers' was first composed in Syriac in the sixth century; a longer Arabic version was composed by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Hunayan Ibn Ishaq]] (809-973) the distinguished scholar-translator, and a still longer one by al-Mubashshir ibn Fatiq (who also wrote a book about Alexander) around 1053. Hunayan's version was translated into Spanish ... in the late thirteenth century.<ref>Hofmann, Heinz. ''Latin fiction: the Latin novel in context.'' Routledge, 1999. p.245</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Arabic ''Alexander romance'' also had an influence on a wider range of Arabic literature. It has been noted that some features of the Arabic Alexander legends found their way into ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]'', a medieval story-cycle of Arabic origin. Sinbad, the hero of the epic, is a fictional [[sailor]] from [[Basrah]], living during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena. As a separate example of this influence on Arabic literature, the legend of Alexander's search for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] is found in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of [[Middle East]]ern and [[South Asia]]n stories and [[Folklore|folktales]] compiled in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\n===Andalusian traditions===\n[[File:Poema de Yusuf.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of a 14th-century poem (''Poema de Yu\u00e7uf'') written in [[Aljamiado]] (Spanish and [[Mozarabic]] language [[transliterated]] in [[Arabic alphabet]]).]]\n\nAfter the [[Umayyad]] Muslim conquest of [[Al-Andalus]] (Spain) in 711 AD, Muslim literature flourished under the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] (929 to 1031 AD). An  [[Arabic]] derivative of the ''Alexander romance'' was produced, called ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'').<ref name=Zuwiyya2001/> The material was later incorporated into ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (''Tales of the Prophets''):\n\n<blockquote>By the turn of the first millennium C.E., the romance of Alexander in Arabic had a core centered on the Greek legendary material ... Interwoven later into this narrative in the ''Tales of the Prophets'' literature were episodes of an apparent Arab-Islamic elaboration: the construction of a great barrier to keep the people of Gog and Magog from harassing the people of the civilized world until Judgement Day, the voyage to the end of the Earth to witness the sun set in a pool of boiling mud, and Dhu al-Qarnayn's expedition into the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Fountain of Life]] accompanied by his companion [[Al-Khidir|Khidir]] (\"the Green-One\").<ref name=Zuwiyya2009/></blockquote>\n\nBy 1236 AD, the [[Reconquista]] was essentially completed and Europeans had retaken the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the Muslims, but the [[Emirate of Granada]], a small Muslim vassal of the Christian [[Kingdom of Castile]], remained in Spain until 1492 AD. During the Reconquista, Muslims were forced to either convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the peninsula. The descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity were called the [[Morisco]]s (meaning \"[[Moors|Moor]]-like\") and were suspecting of secretly practicing Islam. The Moriscos used a language called [[Aljamiado]], which was a dialect of the Spanish language ([[Mozarabic]]) but was written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos; prayers and the sayings of Muhammad were translated into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Quranic verses in the original Arabic. During this period, a version of the Alexander legend was written in the Aljamaido language, building on the Arabic ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as well as [[Romance language]] versions of the ''Alexander romance''.<ref>Zuwiyya, David Z. \"Translation and the Arat of Recreation: The legend of Alexander the Great from the ''Pseudo-Callisthenes'' to the Aljamiado-Morisco ''Rrekontamiento del rrey Alisandre''\" in ''Sensus de sensu: Estudios filol\u00f3gicos de traducci\u00f3n''.

For example, Pseudo-Callisthenes is the source of many incidents in the ''[[Shahnama]]'' written by [[Ferdowsi]] (935\u20131020 AD) in [[New Persian]]. Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], making him the half-brother of the last Achaemenid [[shah]], [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]]. By the 12th century such important writers as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]]) were making him the subject of their [[Epic poetry|epic poems]]. The Muslim traditions also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of [[Aristotle]] and the direct student of [[Plato]].\n\nThere is also evidence that the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the ''Alexander romance'', dating to the 6th century, was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost  [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) manuscript.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/>\n\n===Central Asian traditions===\n\nCertain Muslim people of [[Central Asia]], specifically [[Bulgars|Bulgar]], [[Tatar]] and [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] peoples of the [[Volga]]-[[Ural (region)|Ural]] region (within what is today [[Tatarstan]] in the [[Russian Federation]]), carried on a rich tradition of the Alexander legend well into the 19th century. The region was conquered by the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in the early 10th century. In these legends, Alexander is referred to as ''[[Alexander III of Macedon|Iskandar]] Dhul-Qarnayn'' (Alexander the Two Horned), and is \"depicted as founder of local cities and an ancestor of local figures.\" The local folklore about ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' played in an important role in communal identity:\n\n<blockquote>The conversion of the [[Volga Bulghars]] to Islam is commonly dated to the first decades of the 10th century, and by the middle of the 12th century, it is apparent that Islamic historical figures and Islamic forms of communal validation had become important factors for Bulghar communal and political cohesion. The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] traveler Ab\u016b Hamid al-Gharn\u0101ti who visited Bulghar in the 1150s, noted that Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn passed through Bulghar, that is, the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] region, on his way to build the iron walls that contained Y\u0101'j\u016bj and M\u0101'j\u016bj [Gog and Magog] within the [[land of darkness]] ... while Najib al-Hamad\u0101ni reports that the rulers of Bulghar claimed descent from Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn.<ref name=frank>{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Allen J. |year=2000 |title=Historical Legends of the Volga-Ural Muslims concerning Alexander the Great, the City of Yelabuga, and B\u0101chm\u0101n Kh\u0101n |journal= Revue des mondes musulmans et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e |volume=89-90 |issue=89\u201390 |pages=89\u2013107 |doi=10.4000/remmm.274|doi-access=free }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Iskandar Dhul-Qanryan'' legends played an important role in the conversion narrative of the Volga Bulgar Muslims:\n\n<blockquote>There are numerous digressions dealing with the founding of the Bulghar conversion narrative, and legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn [Alexander Dhul-Qarnayn]  and [[Socrates]]. According to the account, Socrates was born a Christian in [[Samarqand]] and went to Greece to serve Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn (Iskandar R\u016bmi). Together, they went to the [[Land of Darkness]] (diy\u0101r-i zulmat) to seek the [[Fountain of Youth]] (\u0101b-i hay\u0101t). In the northern lands they built a city and called it Bulghar.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1577 AD the [[Tsardom of Russia]] annexed control of the region and Bulgar Muslim writings concerning Dhul-Qarnayn do not appear again until the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw a resurgence of local ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as a source of Muslim and ethnic identity:\n\n<blockquote>It was only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries that we begin to see historical legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn reemerge among [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] Muslims, at least in written form, and it was not until the 19th century that such legends were recorded from local Muslim oral tradition. In one of his earliest historical works, entitled Ghil\u0101lat al-Zam\u0101n and written in 1877 the Tatar theologian, Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Marj\u0101n\u012b wrote that according to Arabic and other Muslim writings, as well as according to popular legends, the city of Bulghar was founded by Alexander the Great.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\n== Orientalist and western views ==\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studying the Quran began researching the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn. Theodor N\u00f6ldeke, believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander the Great as mentioned in versions of the ''Alexander romance'' and related literature in Syriac (a dialect of [[Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]]).<ref>[[#Noldeke|N\u00f6ldeke]].</ref> The Syriac manuscripts were translated into English in 1889 by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].<ref name=budge1889>[[#Budge1889|Budge 1889]].</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century [[Andrew Runni Anderson]] wrote a series of articles on the question in the ''Transactions of the [[American Philological Association]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\">[[#Anderson1927|Anderson 1927]].</ref> The findings of the [[philologists]] imply that the source of the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn is the ''Alexander romance'', a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander's exploits from [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and early [[Christianity|Christian]] sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions for two-thousand years, throughout [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\"/>\n\nAs can be seen in the following quotation from Edwards, secular [[philologists]] studying ancient [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] [[legend]]s about Alexander the Great also came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient [[epithet]] for Alexander the Great. Edwards says, <blockquote>Alexander's association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]. The denial of Alexander's identity as Dhul-Qarnain is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world\u2014both in the east and the west. The popularity of the legend of Alexander the Great proves that these cultures share a history which suggests that perhaps they are not so different after all.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\">[[#Edwards2002|Edwards 2002]].</ref></blockquote>Although modern academics have found that the oldest Alexander romance does not contain the episode where Alexander build the gates against Gog and Magog,<blockquote>The Syriac tradition is one of the most interesting versions of the many existing oriental redactions of the Romance. It dates from the 7th century and goes back on a quite similar Vorlage of the Greek recensio vetusta (n).4 The Syrian redactor, probably an East Syrian Christian, added a certain number of until then unknown episodes to the text. The episode of Alexander's building a wall against Gog and Magog, however, is not found in the oldest Greek, Latin, Armenian and Syriac versions of the Romance.<ref>Van Donzel, Emeri J., and Andrea Schmidt.

Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the ''Alexander romance'' and some [[recension]]s feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to [[Paradise]], journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth).\n\nThe earliest [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of the ''Alexander romance'', as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages.<ref>[[#McGinn1998|McGinn 1998]].</ref>  As the ''Alexander romance'' persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighbouring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of [[satire]], representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favour to an unrighteous ruler? This [[Problem of evil|theological need]], plus acculturation to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish [[ethnocentrism]]. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a [[Righteous among the Nations|righteous gentile]] or even a believing monotheist.<ref>[[#Jewish Encyclopedia|Broyd\u00e9 1906]].</ref>\n\nThe Christianized peoples of the [[Near East]], inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the ''Alexander romance'', further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a [[saint]]. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander ''\"the Believing King\"'', implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the ''Alexander romance'' were combined with [[Biblical]] legends such as [[Gog and Magog]].\n\nDuring the period of history during which the ''Alexander romance'' was written, little was known about the true [[historical Alexander the Great]] as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends. It was not until the [[Renaissance]] (1300\u20131600 AD) that the true history of Alexander III was rediscovered:\n\n<blockquote>Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC there has been no age in history, whether in the West or in the East, in which his name and exploits have not been familiar. And yet not only have all contemporary records been lost but even the work based on those records though written some four and a half centuries after his death, the ''[[Anabasis Alexandri|Anabasis]]'' of [[Arrian]], was totally unknown to the writers of the Middle Ages and became available to Western scholarship only with the Revival of Learning [the Renaissance].  The perpetuation of Alexander's fame through so many ages and amongst so many peoples is due in the main to the innumerable recensions and transmogrifications of a work known as the ''Alexander Romance'' or ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''.<ref name=\"Boyle 1974\">[[#Boyle1974|Boyle 1974]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Dating and origins of the Alexander legends===\n[[File:Syriac Sert\u00e2 book script.jpg|thumb|250px|An 11th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[manuscript]].

Syriac  became the vehicle of [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity]] and culture, spreading throughout [[Asia]]. Before [[Arabic]] became the dominant language, Syriac was a major language among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian communities of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Several Syriac manuscripts of the ''[[Alexander romance]]'' exist, dating from the 7th century. The [[:Category:Greek\u2013Syriac translators|Greek\u2013Syriac translators]] are generally credited with introducing the works of the ancient Greeks to pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabia]].]]\nThe legendary Alexander material originated as early as the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305 BC to 30 BC)  and its unknown authors are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]'' (not to be confused with [[Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who was Alexander's official historian). The earliest surviving manuscript of the ''Alexander romance'', called the \u03b1 ([[alpha]]) [[recension]], can be dated to the 3rd century AD and was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Alexandria]]:\n\n<blockquote>There have been many theories regarding the date and sources of this curious work [the ''Alexander romance'']. According to the most recent authority, ... it was compiled by a Greco-Egyptian writing in Alexandria about A.D. 300. The sources on which the anonymous author drew were twofold. On the one hand he made use of a `romanticized history of Alexander of a highly rhetorical type depending on the [[Cleitarchus]] tradition, and with this he amalgamated a collection of imaginary letters derived from an ''Epistolary Romance of Alexander'' written in the first century B.C. He also included two long letters from Alexander to his mother [[Olympias]] and his tutor [[Aristotle]]  describing his marvellous adventures in India and at the end of the World. These are the literary expression of a living popular tradition and as such are the most remarkable and interesting part of the work.<ref name=Brock1970/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] variants of the ''Alexander romance'' continued to evolve until, in the 4th century, the Greek legend was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius]] (where it is called the ''[[Res gestae Alexandri Magni]]'') and from Latin it spread to all major [[vernacular]] languages of [[Europe]] in the Middle Ages. Around the same as its translation into Latin, the Greek text was also translated into the [[Syriac language]] and from Syriac it spread to eastern cultures and languages as far afield as China and Southeast Asia.<ref>HANAWAY, WILLIAM L. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama ESKANDAR-N\u0100MA]. Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica.</ref> The Syriac legend was the source of an [[Arabic]] variant called the ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'')<ref name=Zuwiyya2001>[[#Zuwiyya2001|Zuwiyya 2001]]</ref> and a [[Persian language|Persian]] variant  called the ''[[Iskandarnamah]]'' (''Book of Alexander''), as well as [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Ethiopic]] translations.<ref name=Zuwiyya2009>[[#Zuwiyya2009|Zuwiyya 2009]].</ref>\n\nThe version recorded in Syriac is of particular importance because it was current in the [[Middle East]] during the time of the Quran's writing and is regarded as being closely related to the [[literary]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Quran. The Syriac legend, as it has survived, consists of five distinct manuscripts, including a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] religious legend concerning Alexander and a sermon about Alexander ascribed to the Syriac poet-theologian [[Jacob of Serugh]] (451\u2013521 AD, also called Mar Jacob), which according to Reinink was composed around 629-636.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Reign of Heraclius: Crisis & Confrontation|last=Reinink |display-authors=etal |publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=35|quote=A syriac metrical homily ascribed to Jacob of Serug, the so called Alexanderlied, was composed between 629 - 636}}</ref> The Syriac Christian legend concentrates on Alexander's journey to the end of the World, where he constructs the ''[[Gates of Alexander]]'' to enclose the evil nations of ''[[Gog and Magog]]'', while the sermon describes his journey to the ''[[Land of Darkness]]'' to discover the ''[[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]'' (Fountain of Youth). These legends concerning Alexander are remarkably similar to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn found in the Quran.<ref name=stoneman2003>[[#Stoneman2003|Stoneman 2003]].</ref>\n\nOne of the five Syriac manuscripts, dated to the 18th century, has a version of the Syriac legend that has been  generally dated to between 629 AD and 636 AD. There is evidence in the legend of  \"''[[ex eventu]]'' knowledge of the [[Khazar]] invasion of [[Armenia]] in A.D. 629,\"<ref>[[#Czegledy1954|Czegl\u00e9dy 1954]].</ref><ref>[[#Czegledy1957|Czegl\u00e9dy 1957]].</ref> which suggests that the legend must have been burdened with additions by a [[redaction|redactor]] sometime around 629 AD.  The legend   appears to have been composed as [[propaganda]] in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD) shortly after he defeated the Persians in the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602\u2013628]]. It is notable that this manuscript fails to mention the Islamic conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 636 AD by [[Muhammad]]'s (570\u2013632 AD) successor, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] (590\u2013644 AD). This fact means that the legend might have been recorded before the \"cataclysmic event\"` that was the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] and the resulting [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|surrender of Jerusalem]] in November 636 AD. That the [[Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars]] would have been referenced in the legend, had it been written after 636 AD, is supported by the fact that in 692 AD a Syriac Christian adaption of the ''Alexander romance'' called the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' was indeed written as a response to the Muslim invasions and was [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] (?\u2013311 AD); this ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' equated the evil nations of ''Gog and Magog'' with the Muslim invaders and shaped the [[eschatology|eschatological]] imagination of [[Christendom]] for centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe manuscripts also contain evidence of lost texts. For example, there is some evidence of a lost pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] version of the translation that is thought to have been an intermediary between the Syriac Christian and the [[Ethiopic]] Christian translations.<ref>[[#Doufikar2003|Doufikar-Aerts 2003]].</ref> There is also evidence that the Syriac translation was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) intermediary.<ref name=Brock1970>[[#Brock1970|Brock 1970]].</ref>\n\nOne scholar (Kevin van Bladel)<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:175-203>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.175-203</ref> who finds striking similarities between the Quranic verses 18:83-102 and the Syriac legend in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]], dates the work to 629-630 AD or before Muhammad's death, not 629-636 AD.<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:178-79/> The Syriac legend matches many details in the five parts of the verses (Alexander being the two horned one, journey to edge of the world, punishment of evil doers, Gog and Magog, etc.) and also \"makes some sense of the cryptic Qur'anic story\" being 21 pages (in one edition)<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:178-79>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.178-79</ref> not 20 verses. (The sun sets in a fetid poisonous ocean\u2014not spring\u2014surrounding the earth, Gog and Magog are Huns, etc.) Van Bladel finds it more plausible that the Syriac legend is the source of the Quranic verses than vice versa, as the Syriac legend was written before the Arab conquests when the Hijazi Muslim community was still remote from and little known to the Mesopotamian site of the legend's creation, whereas Arabs worked as troops and scouts for during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] and could have been exposed to the legend.<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:189-909>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.189-90</ref>\n\n==Philological evidence==\n===Summary===\n[[Philologists]], studying ancient Christian legends about Alexander the Great, have come to conclude that the Quran's stories about Dhul-Qarnayn closely parallel certain legends about Alexander the Great found in ancient Hellenistic and Christian writings.

The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle]] of Ammon at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumours spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.<ref name=coin>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490\u2013336 bc|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382</ref><ref name=plutarch>Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]</ref> Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:\n\n<blockquote>He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ...

In the prophecy, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] has a vision of a ram with two long horns and verse 20 explains that ''\"The ram which thou sawest having two horns is the kings of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]].\"'':\n\n<blockquote>[[Josephus]] [37\u2013100 AD], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xi, 8, 5 tells of a visit that Alexander is purported to have made to [[Jerusalem]], where he met the high priest Jaddua and the assembled Jews, and was shown the book of Daniel in which it was prophesied that some one of the Greeks would overthrow the empire of Persia. Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3\u20138 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ...  \"The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece.\" This identification is accepted by the church fathers ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the ''Alexander romance,'' in the sermon by [[Jacob of Serugh]], describes Alexander as having been given horns of iron by God. The legend describes Alexander (as a Christian king) bowing himself in prayer, saying:\n\n<blockquote>O God ... I know in my mind that thou hast exalted me above all kings, and ''thou hast made me horns upon my head, wherewith I might thrust down the kingdoms of the world''...I will magnify thy name, O Lord, forever ... And if the Messiah, who is the Son of God [Jesus], comes in my days, I and my troops will worship Him...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile the ''Syriac Legend'' references the horns of Alexander, it consistently refers to the hero by his Greek name, not using a variant epithet.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing| isbn = 978-1-78673-131-9| last = Zadeh| first = Travis| title = Mapping Frontiers Across Medieval Islam: Geography, Translation and the 'Abbasid Empire| date = 28 February 2017|page=241}}</ref> The use of the Islamic epithet \"Dhu al-Qarnayn\", the \"two-horned\", first occurred in the Quran.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = University of Toronto Press| isbn = 978-1-4426-4466-3| last = Faustina Doufikar-Aerts| title = Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages: Transcultural Perspectives| chapter = Coptic Miniature Painting in the Arabic Alexander Romance| date = 2016|page=169}}</ref>\n\nIn Christian Alexander legends written in [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] (an ancient [[South Semitic]] language) between the 14th and the 16th century, Alexander the Great is always explicitly referred to using the [[epithet]] the \"Two Horned.\" A passage from the Ethiopic Christian legend describes the [[Angel of the Lord]] calling Alexander by this name:\n\n<blockquote>Then God, may He be blessed and exalted! put it into the heart of the Angel to call ''Alexander 'Two-horned,' '' ... And Alexander said unto him, ' ''Thou didst call me by the name Two-horned,'' but my name is Alexander ... and I thought that thou hadst cursed me by calling me by this name.'

They represent him as a god, as a son of a god, as a prophet and propagandist of the Most High, as something approaching the role of a messiah, and also as the champion of Allah. They represent him as a world conqueror, who subjugated the two horns or ends of the world, the lands of the rising and of the setting sun ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nFor these reasons, among others, the Quran's Arabic epithet \"Dhul-Qarnayn,\" literally meaning \"the two-horned one,\" is interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.\n\n===Alexander's Wall===\n[[File:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Iranian art|Persian]] painting from the 16th century illustrating the building of the wall with the help of the [[jinn]]]]\n\n====Early accounts of Alexander's Wall====\nThe  building of gates in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance and the wall is  known as the [[Gates of Alexander]] or the [[Caspian Gates]]. The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the [[Caspian Sea]], through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of [[Bessus]] in 329 BC, although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100 AD) mentions that:\n\n<blockquote>...a nation of the Alans, whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being [[Scythians]] ... travelled through a passage which King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates.<ref>''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'', VII, vii, Flavius Josephus</ref></blockquote>\n\nJosephus also records that the people of Magog, the Magogites, were synonymous with the Scythians.<ref>''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I, vi, Flavius Josephus</ref> According to Andrew Runni Anderson,<ref>[[#Anderson1932|Anderson 1932]].</ref> this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the Quran's revelation, not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the Quranic account. Similarly, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] (347\u2013420 AD), in his ''Letter 77'', mentions that,\n\n<blockquote>The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from [[Sea of Azov|Maeotis]] (they had their haunts between the icy [[Tanais]] and the rude [[Massagetae]], ''where the [[gates of Alexander]] keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus'').<ref>Letter 77 \"To Oceanus\", 8, Saint Jerome</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his Commentary on [[Ezekiel]] (38:2), Jerome identifies the nations located beyond the [[Caucasus mountains]] and near [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]] as Gog and Magog.  Thus the [[Gates of Alexander]] legend  was combined with the legend of [[Gog and Magog]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. It has been suggested that the incorporation of the Gog and Magog legend into the ''Alexander romance'' was prompted by the [[Hunnic Empire#Early campaigns|invasion of the Huns]] across the [[Caucasus]] mountains in 395 AD into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]].<ref>''Gog and Magog : Ezekiel 38-39 as pre-text for Revelation 19,17 and 20,7\u201310'', Sverre B\u00f8e, Mohr Siebec, 2001 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=huns+caucasus+barrier+395&source=bl&ots=OzcMrWCevB&sig=YF72Rf6ypxYmGIySA3wsAbzftBc&hl=en&ei=eq_SSsG8C5PIlAex5_SoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=huns%20caucasus%20barrier%20395&f=false see excerpt]) ({{ISBN|978-3-16-147520-7}})</ref>\n\n====Alexander's Wall in Christian legends====\n{{Main|Gates of Alexander}}\nChristian legends speak of the Caspian Gates (Gates of Alexander), also known as Alexander's wall, built by Alexander the Great in the [[Caucasus mountains]]. Several variations of the legend can be found. In the story, Alexander the Great built a gate of iron between two mountains, at the end of the [[flat Earth|Earth]], to prevent the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] from ravaging the plains. The Christian legend was written in [[Syria]] shortly before the Quran's writing and closely parallels the story of Dhul-Qarnayn.<ref>[[#Southgate1978|Southgate 1978]].</ref> The legend describes an [[apocryphal]] letter from Alexander to his mother, wherein he writes:\n\n<blockquote>I petitioned the exalted Deity, and he heard my prayer. And the exalted Deity commanded the two mountains and they moved and approached each other to a distance of twelve [[ell]]s, and there I made ... copper gates 12 ells broad, and 60 ells high, and smeared them over within and without with copper ... so that neither fire nor iron, nor any other means should be able to loosen the copper; ... Within these gates, I made another construction of stones ... And having done this I finished the construction by putting mixed tin and lead over the stones, and smearing .... over the whole, so that no one might be able to do anything against the gates. I called them the Caspian Gates. Twenty and two Kings did I shut up therein.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThese [[pseudepigraphic]] letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, describing his marvellous adventures at the end of the World, date back to the original Greek [[Alexander romance|recension \u03b1]] written in the 4th century in Alexandria. The letters are \"the literary expression of a living popular tradition\" that had been evolving for at least three centuries before the Quran was written.<ref name=\"Boyle 1974\"/>\n\n====Medieval accounts of Alexander's Wall====\n[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The wall of the citadel in [[Derbent]], Russia. Built by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] kings, it was often identified with the \"[[Gates of Alexander]]\". The [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], as well as later Caliphs, sent expeditions to Derbent to seek out this wall.]]\n\nSeveral historical figures, both Muslim and Christian, searched for Alexander's Gate and several different identifications were made with actual walls. During the [[Middle Ages]], the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'' (1254\u20131324 AD) and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. The ''Alexander romance'' identified the Gates of Alexander, variously, with the [[Pass of Dariel]], the [[Derbent|Pass of Derbent]], the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] and even the [[Great Wall of China]]. In the legend's original form, Alexander's Gates are located at the Pass of Dariel. In later versions of the Christian legends,  dated to around the time of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD), the Gates are instead located in [[Derbent]], a city  situated on a narrow strip of land between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains, where an ancient [[Sassanid]] fortification was mistakenly identified with the wall built by Alexander. In the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'', the wall in Derbent is identified with the Gates of Alexander. The [[Gates of Alexander]] are most commonly identified with the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]] whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometres between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Bretschneider1876|Bretschneider 1876]].</ref> Later historians would regard these legends as false:\n\n<blockquote>The gate itself had wandered from the Caspian Gates to the pass of Dariel, from the pass of Dariel to the pass of Derbend [Derbent], as well as to the far north; nay, it had travelled even as far as remote eastern or north-eastern Asia, gathering in strength and increasing in size as it went, and actually carrying the mountains of Caspia with it. Then, as the full light of modern day come on, the ''Alexander Romance'' ceased to be regarded as history, and with it Alexander's Gate passed into the realm of [[fairy]]land.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Andrew Runni |editor1-last= Anderson |title= Alexander's Gate, Gog and Magog, and the enclosed nations |date=January 1932  |publisher= [[Medieval Academy of America]] |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0-910956-07-9}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the Muslim world, several expeditions were undertaken to try to find and study Alexanders's wall, specifically the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]]. An early expedition to  Derbent was ordered by the Caliph [[Umar]] (586\u2013644 AD) himself, during the [[Arab conquest of Armenia]] where they heard about Alexander's Wall in Derbent from the conquered Christian Armenians. Umar's expedition was recorded by the renowned [[tafsir|exegetes of the Quran]], [[Al-Tabarani]] (873\u2013970 AD) and [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 AD), and by the Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179\u20131229 AD):\n\n<blockquote>... [[Umar]] sent ... in 22 A.H. [643 AD] ... an expedition to Derbent [Russia] ... `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah [was appointed] as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered [[Eastern Armenia|Armenia]], the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz [ruler of Armenia] informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details ...<ref name=\"Tabari\">[[Tafsir al-Tabari]], Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235\u2013239</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo hundred years later, the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Wathiq]] (?\u2013847 AD) dispatched an expedition to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain in Derbent, Russia. The expedition was led by [[Sallam-ul-Tarjuman]], whose observations were recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and by [[Ibn Kathir]]:\n\n<blockquote>...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn].<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\">Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, Yaqut al-Hamawi</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading \"Khazar\" (Caspian) he writes:\n\n<blockquote>This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (763 \u2013 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent.  Not all Muslim travellers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn's wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304\u20131369 AD) travelled to China on order of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] and he comments in his travel log that \"Between it [the city of [[Quanzhou|Zaitun]] in [[Fujian]]] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days' travel.\"<ref name=\"F. Beckingham p. 896\">[[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|H. A. R. Gibb]] and C. F. Beckingham, trans. ''The Travels of Ibn Battuta, A.D. 1325\u20131354'' (Vol. IV).

In Islamic [[eschatology]], before the Day of Judgement Gog and Magog will destroy this gate, allowing them to ravage the Earth, as it is described in the Quran:\n\n:Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose [from their barrier], and they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise [Day of Resurrection] shall draw near [of fulfilment]. Then [when mankind is resurrected from their graves], you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror.  [They will say,] \u2018Woe to us!  We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were wrongdoers.\u2019 (Quran 21:96\u201397. Note that the phrases in square brackets are not in the Arabic original.)\n\n====Gog and Magog in Christian legends====\n[[File:Radkarte MKL1888.png|thumb|200px|Example of a [[T and O map|T-O map]] appearing in a German encyclopedia published by [[Joseph Meyer (publisher)|Joseph Meyer]] (1796-1856 AD). The T-O map was the first printed map in Europe. The map shows a disc shaped Earth surrounded by [[Oceanus]], with the location [[Gog and Magog]] to the north, and [[Paropamisadae]] mountains ([[Hindu Kush]]) to the east in Asia. In the Christian legends, Alexander built the wall against Gog and Magog in the north, near the Caspian sea, and then went to the ends of the earth at the Paropamisadae, where it was supposed that the sun rises.]]\n\nIn the Syriac Christian legends, Alexander the Great encloses the Gog and Magog horde behind a mighty gate between two mountains, preventing Gog and Magog from invading the Earth. In addition, it is written in the Christian legend that in the [[end time]]s God will cause the Gate of Gog and Magog to be destroyed, allowing the Gog and Magog horde to ravage the Earth;\n\n<blockquote>The Lord spake by the hand of the angel, [saying] ...The gate of the north shall be opened on the day of the end of the world, and on that day shall evil go forth on the wicked ... The earth shall quake and this door [gate] which thou [Alexander] hast made be opened ... and anger with fierce wrath shall rise up on mankind and the earth ... shall be laid waste ... And the nations that is within this gate shall be roused up, and also the host of Agog and the peoples of Magog [Gog and Magog] shall be gathered together. These peoples, the fiercest of all creatures.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian Syriac legend describes a [[flat Earth]] orbited by the [[sun]] and surrounded by the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) mountains. The Paropamisadae mountains are  in turn surrounded by a narrow tract of land which is followed by a treacherous Ocean sea called [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]]. It is within this tract of land between the [[Paropamisadae]] mountains and [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] that Alexander encloses Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes \"the old wise men\" explaining this [[geography]] and [[cosmology]] of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:\n\n<blockquote>The old men say, \"Look, my lord the king, and see a wonder, this mountain which God has set as a great boundary.\" King Alexander the son of Philip said, \"How far is the extent of this mountain?\" The old men say, \"Beyond India it extends in its appearance.\" The king said, \"How far does this side come?\" The old men say, \"Unto all the end of the earth.\" And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ... The king said, \"Where have the hosts [of Gog and Magog] come forth to plunder the land and all the world from of old?\" They show him a place in the middle of the mountains, a narrow pass which had been constructed by God ...<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\n[[Flat Earth#Early Christian Church|Flat Earth beliefs in the Early Christian Church]] varied and the Fathers of the Church shared different approaches. Those of them who were more close to [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s visions, like [[Origen]], shared peacefully the belief in a [[spherical Earth]]. A second tradition, including [[St Basil]] and [[St Augustine]], accepted the idea of the round Earth and the radial gravity, but in a critical way. In particular they pointed out a number of doubts about the [[antipodes]] and the physical reasons of the radial gravity. However, a flat Earth approach was more or less shared by all the Fathers coming from the Syriac area, who were more inclined to follow the letter of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Diodore of Tarsus]] (?\u2013390 AD), [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] (6th century), and [[Chrysostom]] (347\u2013407 AD) belonged to this flat Earth tradition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Leone Montagnini, \"La questione della forma della Terra.

In his 9th century work ''[[Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam]]'', the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Christian of Stavelot]]  refers to the Khazars as [[Huns|Hunnic]] descendants of Gog and Magog, and says they are ''\"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism\"'';<ref>Kevin Alan Brook. ''The Jews of Khazaria.'' 2nd ed. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006.</ref> the Khazars were a [[Central Asia]]n people with a long association with [[Judaism]]. A [[Georgian people|Georgian]] tradition, echoed in a chronicle, also identifies the Khazars with Gog and Magog, stating they are ''\"wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts, eaters of blood.\"''<ref>Schultze (1905), p. 23.{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\nEarly Muslim scholars writing about Dhul-Qarnayn also associated Gog and Magog with the Khazars. [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 CE), the famous commentator of the Quran, identified Gog and Magog with the Khazars who lived between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] in his work ''[[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah]]'' (''The Beginning and the End'').<ref>[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Al-Bidayah wa'l-Nihayah (The Beginning and the End)''</ref><ref>Ibn Kathir, \"Stories of the Prophets\", page 54. Riyadh, SA Maktaba Dar-us-Salam, 2003</ref> The Muslim explorer [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], in his travelogue regarding his diplomatic mission in 921 AD to [[Volga Bulgars]] (a [[vassal]] of the [[khazaria|Khazarian Empire]]), noted the beliefs about Gog and Magog being the ancestors of the Khazars.<ref>''Collection of Geographical Works by Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Fadlan, Abu Dulaf Al-Khazraji'', ed. Fuat Sezgin, Frankfurt am Main, 1987</ref>\n\nThus Muslim scholars associated the Khazars with Dhul-Qarnayn just as the Christian legends associated the Khazars with Alexander the Great.\n\n===The rising place of the Sun===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}\nA peculiar aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Quran, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to \"the rising place of the Sun\" and the \"setting place of the Sun,\" where he saw the Sun sets into a murky (or boiling) spring of water (or mud). Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the \"rising place of the Sun,\" and finds that these people somehow have \"no shelter.\"\n\nIn his commentary of the Quran, [[Ibn Kathir]]  (1301\u20131373 CE) explains that verse 18:89 is referring to the furthest point that could be travelled west:\n\n<blockquote>(Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until ''he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun's setting, which is the west of the earth.'' As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he traveled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.<ref>Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Kahf 18:89, ''His traveling and reaching the Place where the Sun sets (the West)'' ([http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/7823/2/ link])</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this commentary Ibn Kathir differentiates between the end of the Earth and the supposed \"place in the sky\" where the sun sets (the \"resting place\" of the sun. Ibn Kathir contends that Dhul-Qarnayn did reach the farthest place that could be travelled west but not the \"resting place\" of the sun and he goes on to mention that the [[People of the Book]] (Jews and Christians) tell myths about Dhul-Qarnayn travelling so far beyond the end of the Earth that the sun was \"behind him.\" This shows that Ibn Kathir was aware of the Christian legends and it suggests that Ibn Kathir considered Christian myths about Alexander to be referring to the same figure as the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Qu'an.\n\nA similar theme is elaborated upon in several places in the Islamic [[hadith]] literature, in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]:\n\n<blockquote>It is narrated ... that the Messenger of Allah one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne [of Allah]. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place...<ref>Sahih Muslim 1:297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe setting place of the sun is also commented on by [[Al-Tabari]] (838-923 AD) and [[Al-Qurtubi]] (1214\u20131273 AD) and, like [[Ibn Kathir]], they showed some reservations towards the literal idea of the sun setting in a muddy spring but held to the basic theme of Dhul-Qarnayn reaching the ends of the Earth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hockney|first1=Mike|title=World, Underworld, Overworld, Dreamworld|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781326016579}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}\n\nThat the Earth must be spherical was known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]] (570\u2013495 BC), but this knowledge did not reach ancient folklore such as the ''Alexander romance'' where Alexander travels to the ends of a flat Earth. It is notable that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]] had no scientific astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy was limited to measuring time based on empirical observations of the \"rising and setting\" of the sun, moon, and particular stars. This area of astronomical study was known as ''anwa'' and continued to be developed after [[Islamization]] by the Arabs.<ref name=\"Dallal\">Dallal, Ahmad (1999), \"Science, Medicine and Technology\", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York, pg. 162</ref>  [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] began in the 8th century and the first major Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' written in 830 by [[Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b|al-Khwarizmi]].  The work is significant as it introduced the [[Ptolemaic system]] into Islamic sciences (the Ptolemaic system was ultimately replaced by the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe).\n\n====The rising place of the Sun in the Alexander legends====\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n{{Gallery\n|lines=15\n|File:Map homer world.jpg|Rendition of [[Homer]]'s view of the world (prior to 900 BC).

The Sun emerges from underneath the Earth, travelling along the fixed dome of the sky, and is shown rising from Oceanus.\n}}</div>\n\n<blockquote> The place of his [the Sun's] rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of heaven to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves ... And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he [it] straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he [the Sun] rises ...

Now this I desire to go and see, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds all creation.\" The nobles answered and said to the king, ... \"As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heaveans rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles there is the foetid sea, [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. Men are not able to come near to this foetid sea ... Its waters are like poison and if men swim therein, they die at once.\"<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThis ancient [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of a legendary figure travelling to the end of Earth is also found in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which can be dated to c. 2000 BC, making it one of the earliest known works of literary writing.<ref name=Markaz>Sattari J., \"A study on the epic of Gilgamesh and the legend of Alexander.\" Markaz Publications 2001 (In Persian)</ref> In the [[epic poem]], in tablet nine, Gilgamesh sets out on a quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] to seek immortality. Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth where he grapples and slays monstrous mountain lions, bears and others. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises from the other world, the gate of which is guarded by two terrible scorpion-beings. They allow him to proceed through the gate after Gilgamesh convinces them to let him pass, stating his divinity and desperation, and he travels through the dark tunnel where the sun travels every night. Just before the sun is about to catch up with him, and with the North Wind and ice lashing him, he reaches the end. The world at the end of the tunnel is a bright wonderland full of trees with leaves of jewels.

He reported that in India the sun's heat is extremely intense in the morning, instead of noon being the hottest time of day. It has been argued that he based this on his belief that since India is located at the extreme east of a flat Earth, it would only be logical if the morning were unbearably hot due to the sun's proximity.<ref>How, Walter W. and Wells, J.

Alexander never marched far west of his native [[Macedon]] and his advances eastward ended at the fringes of India.]]\n\nThe Quran and the ''Alexander romance'' both have it that Dhul-Qarnayn (or Alexander) travelled a great deal. In the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn, \"God gave him unto every thing a road\" (or more literally, \"We gave him the means of everything\" 18:84) He travels as far as the ends of the Earth, to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). The Quran portrays him travelling to the \"setting of the sun.\" Muslim interpretations of these verses are varied, but classical Muslim scholars seemed to have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn's journey was real, not [[allegorical]], and that Dhul-Qarnayn's wall is also a real, physical wall somewhere on Earth.\n\nIn the Christian legends, Alexander travels to the places of the setting and rising of the Sun and this is meant to say that he travelled to the ends of the [[flat Earth]] and thus he had traversed the entire world. This legendary account served to convey the theme of Alexander's exploits as a great conqueror. Alexander was indeed a great conqueror, having ruled the largest empire in [[ancient history]] by the time he was 25 years old. However, the true historical extent of Alexander's travels are known to be greatly exaggerated in legends. For example, legend has it that upon reaching India,\n\n<blockquote>... said Alexander 'Truly, then, all the inhabited world is mine. West, north, east, south, there is nothing more for me to conquer.' Then he sat down and wept because there were not other worlds for him to conquer.<ref>[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&book=thirty&story=alexander Thirty Most Famous Stories Retold], James Baldwin (1841\u20131925)</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn reality, while Alexander did travel a great deal, he did not travel further west than [[ancient Libya]] and did not travel further east than the fringes of India. According to historians, Alexander invaded India following his desire to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea.\" However, when he reached the [[Hyphasis River]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 326 BC, his army nearly [[mutiny|mutinied]] and refused to march further east, exhausted by years of campaigning. Alexander's desire to reach \"the ends of the Earth\" was instilled by his tutor [[Aristotle]]:\n\n<blockquote>Alexander derived his concept of `Asia' from the teaching of Aristotle, for whom `the inhabited earth' was surrounded by `the Great sea' Ocean, and was divided into three areas \u2013 `Europe, Libya and Asia.' Thus the earth was not round but flat, and `Asia' was limited on the west by the [[Tanais]] (Don), the inland sea and the Nile, and on the east by `India' and `the Great Sea' ... he was mistaken in supposing that from the ridge of the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) one would see `the outer sea' and that `India' was a small peninsula running east into that sea.<ref>[[#Hammond1998|Hammond 1998]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of the world taught by Aristotle and followed by Alexander is apparent in Aristotle's ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a treatise on earth sciences where he discusses the \"length\" and \"width\" of \"the inhabited earth.\" However, Aristotle knew that the Earth is spherical and even provided observational proof of this fact. Aristotle's cosmological view was that the Earth is round but he prescribed to the notion of an \"inhabited Earth,\" surrounded by the Ocean, and an \"uninhabited Earth\" (though exactly how much of this was understood by his student Alexander the Great is not known).\n\n==Islamic depictions of Alexander the Great==\n\n===Arabic traditions===\n[[File:secret of secrets a.jpg|thumb|174px|right|Manuscript of the 9th-century Arabic work ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\"), an encyclopedic treatise on a wide range of topics including [[physiognomy]], [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[medicine]]. This work includes a series of supposed letters from [[Aristotle]], addressed to Alexander. The Arabic manuscript was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th century and was influential in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]] ]]\n\nAlexander the Great features prominently in early Arabic literature. There are many surviving versions of the ''Alexander romance'' in Arabic that were written after the conquest of Islam. It is also thought that pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] versions of the ''Alexander romance'' may have existed.<ref name=doufikar-aertis>Doufikar-Aerts, Faustina (2003). ''The Last Days of Alexander in an Arabic Popular Romance of Al-Iskandar.'' in ''The Ancient Novel and Beyond'' by Panayotakis, Zimmerman and Keulen.</ref>\n\nThe earliest surviving Arabic narrative of the Alexander romance was composed by [[Umara ibn Zayd]] (767\u2013815 AD). In the tale, Alexander travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a   \"wonder-stone\" that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish [[Talmudic]] traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Southgate, Minoo.

''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 97, No. 3, (July \u2013 September 1977), pp. 278-\u2013284</ref>\n\nA [[Arabian peninsula|South Arabian]] Alexander legend was written by the [[Yemen]]ite traditionist [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (?\u2013732 AD) and this legend was later incorporated in a book by [[Ibn Hisham]] (?\u2013833 AD) regarding the history of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in ancient Yemen. In the Yemenite variation, Dhul-Qarnayn is identified with an ancient king of Yemen named [[Tubba']], rather than Alexander the Great, but the Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander's Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. The story also mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn (Tubba') visited a castle with glass walls and visited the [[Brahmins]] of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]] in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe ''Alexander romance'' also had an important influence on Arabic [[wisdom literature]]. In ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\", in Arabic ''Kitab sirr al-asrar''), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[ethics]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[medicine]], Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as [[Aristotle]]. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No [[Greek language|Greek]] original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq]] (?\u2013815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.\n\nIn another example of Arabic wisdom literature relating to Alexander, [[Ibn al-Nadim]] (?\u2013997 AD) refers to a work on [[divination]] titled ''The Drawing of Lots by Dhul-Qarnain'' and to a second work on divination by arrows titled ''The gift of Alexander'', but only the titles of these works have survived.\n\nNotably, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] (794\u2013842 AD) had ordered the translation of the ''[[Thesaurus Alexandri]]'', a work on [[elixirs]] and [[amulets]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] into Arabic. The Greek work ''Thesaurus Alexandri'' was attributed to [[Hermes]] (the great messenger of the gods in [[Greek mythology]]) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Yucesoy, Hayrettin. ''Messianic Beliefs & Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam: The Abbasid Caliphate in the Early Ninth Century''. 2009. University of South Carolina. pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nA more direct Arabic translation of the ''Alexander romance,'' called ''Sirat Al-Iskandar'', was discovered in [[Constantinople]], at the [[Hagia Sophia]], and is dated to the 13th century. This version includes the letter from Alexander to his mother about his travels in India and at the end of the World. It also includes features which occur exclusively in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The Arabic legend also retains certain [[pagan]] elements of the story, which are sometimes modified to suit the Islamic message:\n\n<blockquote>It is quite remarkable that some characteristics belonging to a pre-Islamic 'pagan' entourage, have survived in the text ... For example, Alexander orders an offering of sacrificial animals at the temple of [[Hercules]]. In the Arabic letter the name of the deity has been replaced by ''[[Allah]]'' ... Another passage in the account of the palace of Shoshan or Sus, gives a description of the large silver jars, which were alleged to have capacity of three hundred and sixty measures of wine. Alexander puts this assertion to the test, having one of the jars filled with wine and poured out for his soldiers during a banquet. This exact specification has been maintained, heedless of the Islamic ban on the use of wine ... These retouched borrowings are highly significant in this text, because the Arabic Alexander figure is portrayed as a propagator of Islamic monotheism.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/></blockquote>\n\nAnother piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the ''Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers''. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and was later translated into [[Arabic]] and expanded upon. The ''Laments of the Philosophers'' eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe:<ref name=Brock1970/>\n\n<blockquote>[The 'Sayings of the Philosophers' are] remarks of the philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander, who utter a series of [[Apophthegmata Patrum|apophthegms]] on the theme of the brevity of life and the transience of human achievement ... a work entitled 'Sayings of the Philosophers' was first composed in Syriac in the sixth century; a longer Arabic version was composed by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Hunayan Ibn Ishaq]] (809-973) the distinguished scholar-translator, and a still longer one by al-Mubashshir ibn Fatiq (who also wrote a book about Alexander) around 1053. Hunayan's version was translated into Spanish ... in the late thirteenth century.<ref>Hofmann, Heinz. ''Latin fiction: the Latin novel in context.'' Routledge, 1999. p.245</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Arabic ''Alexander romance'' also had an influence on a wider range of Arabic literature. It has been noted that some features of the Arabic Alexander legends found their way into ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]'', a medieval story-cycle of Arabic origin. Sinbad, the hero of the epic, is a fictional [[sailor]] from [[Basrah]], living during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena. As a separate example of this influence on Arabic literature, the legend of Alexander's search for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] is found in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of [[Middle East]]ern and [[South Asia]]n stories and [[Folklore|folktales]] compiled in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\n===Andalusian traditions===\n[[File:Poema de Yusuf.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of a 14th-century poem (''Poema de Yu\u00e7uf'') written in [[Aljamiado]] (Spanish and [[Mozarabic]] language [[transliterated]] in [[Arabic alphabet]]).]]\n\nAfter the [[Umayyad]] Muslim conquest of [[Al-Andalus]] (Spain) in 711 AD, Muslim literature flourished under the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] (929 to 1031 AD). An  [[Arabic]] derivative of the ''Alexander romance'' was produced, called ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'').<ref name=Zuwiyya2001/> The material was later incorporated into ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (''Tales of the Prophets''):\n\n<blockquote>By the turn of the first millennium C.E., the romance of Alexander in Arabic had a core centered on the Greek legendary material ... Interwoven later into this narrative in the ''Tales of the Prophets'' literature were episodes of an apparent Arab-Islamic elaboration: the construction of a great barrier to keep the people of Gog and Magog from harassing the people of the civilized world until Judgement Day, the voyage to the end of the Earth to witness the sun set in a pool of boiling mud, and Dhu al-Qarnayn's expedition into the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Fountain of Life]] accompanied by his companion [[Al-Khidir|Khidir]] (\"the Green-One\").<ref name=Zuwiyya2009/></blockquote>\n\nBy 1236 AD, the [[Reconquista]] was essentially completed and Europeans had retaken the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the Muslims, but the [[Emirate of Granada]], a small Muslim vassal of the Christian [[Kingdom of Castile]], remained in Spain until 1492 AD. During the Reconquista, Muslims were forced to either convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the peninsula. The descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity were called the [[Morisco]]s (meaning \"[[Moors|Moor]]-like\") and were suspecting of secretly practicing Islam. The Moriscos used a language called [[Aljamiado]], which was a dialect of the Spanish language ([[Mozarabic]]) but was written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos; prayers and the sayings of Muhammad were translated into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Quranic verses in the original Arabic. During this period, a version of the Alexander legend was written in the Aljamaido language, building on the Arabic ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as well as [[Romance language]] versions of the ''Alexander romance''.<ref>Zuwiyya, David Z. \"Translation and the Arat of Recreation: The legend of Alexander the Great from the ''Pseudo-Callisthenes'' to the Aljamiado-Morisco ''Rrekontamiento del rrey Alisandre''\" in ''Sensus de sensu: Estudios filol\u00f3gicos de traducci\u00f3n''.

For example, Pseudo-Callisthenes is the source of many incidents in the ''[[Shahnama]]'' written by [[Ferdowsi]] (935\u20131020 AD) in [[New Persian]]. Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], making him the half-brother of the last Achaemenid [[shah]], [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]]. By the 12th century such important writers as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]]) were making him the subject of their [[Epic poetry|epic poems]]. The Muslim traditions also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of [[Aristotle]] and the direct student of [[Plato]].\n\nThere is also evidence that the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the ''Alexander romance'', dating to the 6th century, was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost  [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) manuscript.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/>\n\n===Central Asian traditions===\n\nCertain Muslim people of [[Central Asia]], specifically [[Bulgars|Bulgar]], [[Tatar]] and [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] peoples of the [[Volga]]-[[Ural (region)|Ural]] region (within what is today [[Tatarstan]] in the [[Russian Federation]]), carried on a rich tradition of the Alexander legend well into the 19th century. The region was conquered by the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in the early 10th century. In these legends, Alexander is referred to as ''[[Alexander III of Macedon|Iskandar]] Dhul-Qarnayn'' (Alexander the Two Horned), and is \"depicted as founder of local cities and an ancestor of local figures.\" The local folklore about ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' played in an important role in communal identity:\n\n<blockquote>The conversion of the [[Volga Bulghars]] to Islam is commonly dated to the first decades of the 10th century, and by the middle of the 12th century, it is apparent that Islamic historical figures and Islamic forms of communal validation had become important factors for Bulghar communal and political cohesion. The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] traveler Ab\u016b Hamid al-Gharn\u0101ti who visited Bulghar in the 1150s, noted that Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn passed through Bulghar, that is, the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] region, on his way to build the iron walls that contained Y\u0101'j\u016bj and M\u0101'j\u016bj [Gog and Magog] within the [[land of darkness]] ... while Najib al-Hamad\u0101ni reports that the rulers of Bulghar claimed descent from Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn.<ref name=frank>{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Allen J. |year=2000 |title=Historical Legends of the Volga-Ural Muslims concerning Alexander the Great, the City of Yelabuga, and B\u0101chm\u0101n Kh\u0101n |journal= Revue des mondes musulmans et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e |volume=89-90 |issue=89\u201390 |pages=89\u2013107 |doi=10.4000/remmm.274|doi-access=free }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Iskandar Dhul-Qanryan'' legends played an important role in the conversion narrative of the Volga Bulgar Muslims:\n\n<blockquote>There are numerous digressions dealing with the founding of the Bulghar conversion narrative, and legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn [Alexander Dhul-Qarnayn]  and [[Socrates]]. According to the account, Socrates was born a Christian in [[Samarqand]] and went to Greece to serve Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn (Iskandar R\u016bmi). Together, they went to the [[Land of Darkness]] (diy\u0101r-i zulmat) to seek the [[Fountain of Youth]] (\u0101b-i hay\u0101t). In the northern lands they built a city and called it Bulghar.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1577 AD the [[Tsardom of Russia]] annexed control of the region and Bulgar Muslim writings concerning Dhul-Qarnayn do not appear again until the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw a resurgence of local ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as a source of Muslim and ethnic identity:\n\n<blockquote>It was only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries that we begin to see historical legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn reemerge among [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] Muslims, at least in written form, and it was not until the 19th century that such legends were recorded from local Muslim oral tradition. In one of his earliest historical works, entitled Ghil\u0101lat al-Zam\u0101n and written in 1877 the Tatar theologian, Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Marj\u0101n\u012b wrote that according to Arabic and other Muslim writings, as well as according to popular legends, the city of Bulghar was founded by Alexander the Great.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\n== Orientalist and western views ==\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studying the Quran began researching the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn. Theodor N\u00f6ldeke, believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander the Great as mentioned in versions of the ''Alexander romance'' and related literature in Syriac (a dialect of [[Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]]).<ref>[[#Noldeke|N\u00f6ldeke]].</ref> The Syriac manuscripts were translated into English in 1889 by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].<ref name=budge1889>[[#Budge1889|Budge 1889]].</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century [[Andrew Runni Anderson]] wrote a series of articles on the question in the ''Transactions of the [[American Philological Association]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\">[[#Anderson1927|Anderson 1927]].</ref> The findings of the [[philologists]] imply that the source of the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn is the ''Alexander romance'', a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander's exploits from [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and early [[Christianity|Christian]] sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions for two-thousand years, throughout [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\"/>\n\nAs can be seen in the following quotation from Edwards, secular [[philologists]] studying ancient [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] [[legend]]s about Alexander the Great also came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient [[epithet]] for Alexander the Great. Edwards says, <blockquote>Alexander's association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]. The denial of Alexander's identity as Dhul-Qarnain is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world\u2014both in the east and the west. The popularity of the legend of Alexander the Great proves that these cultures share a history which suggests that perhaps they are not so different after all.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\">[[#Edwards2002|Edwards 2002]].</ref></blockquote>Although modern academics have found that the oldest Alexander romance does not contain the episode where Alexander build the gates against Gog and Magog,<blockquote>The Syriac tradition is one of the most interesting versions of the many existing oriental redactions of the Romance. It dates from the 7th century and goes back on a quite similar Vorlage of the Greek recensio vetusta (n).4 The Syrian redactor, probably an East Syrian Christian, added a certain number of until then unknown episodes to the text. The episode of Alexander's building a wall against Gog and Magog, however, is not found in the oldest Greek, Latin, Armenian and Syriac versions of the Romance.<ref>Van Donzel, Emeri J., and Andrea Schmidt.

DC purchased many of their competitors' comic stables, including [[Fawcett Comics]], whose Beck-created Captain Marvel was central to a lawsuit with DC.]]\n\nThe company began to move aggressively against what it saw as [[copyright infringement|copyright-violating]] imitations from other companies, such as [[Fox Comics]]' [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]], which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing [[Fawcett Comics]] over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], at the time comics' top-selling character (see ''[[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]''). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC\u2014which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title ''Shazam!'' featuring artwork by his creator, [[C. C. Beck]]. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1967, with the creation of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|their Captain Marvel]], forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning [[Shazam! (TV series)|live action TV adaptation]] and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the [[DC Universe]].\n\nWhen the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as [[science fiction]], [[Western comics|Westerns]], [[humour|humor]], and [[Romance comics|romance]]. DC also published [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[Horror comics|horror]] titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including ''Action Comics'' and ''Detective Comics'', the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication.\n\n===Silver Age===\n{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}\n\nIn the mid-1950s, editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] and publisher Liebowitz directed editor [[Julius Schwartz]] (whose roots lay in the [[science-fiction]] book market) to produce a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] story in the try-out title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[penciller|penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[inker]] [[Joe Kubert]] create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's [[civilian]] identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in ''Showcase'' #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the [[Green Lantern]] character, the introduction of the modern all-star team [[Justice League of America]] (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comic books]].\n\nNational did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor [[Mort Weisinger]], introduced such enduring characters as [[Supergirl]], [[Bizarro]], and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful [[Batwoman]], [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.\n\nSince the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that, decades later, was dubbed the \"[[DC Universe]]\" by fans. With the story \"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\", in ''Flash'' #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artists Infantino and [[Joe Giella]]) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes' \"Earth 1\"\u2014in the process creating the foundation for what was later called the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]].\n\nDC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,{{refn|Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)<!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says \"National Comics\" in quote directly below this paragraph--> bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to [[publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]], which was being distributed by DC's Independent News at this time.) during a game of golf.\n<br /><br />\nHowever, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43\u201344\n{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue.

Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces&nbsp;... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.}}\n\nGoodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA's strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most.

That commercial situation especially applied with Marvel's superior [[sell-through]] percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC's roughly 50%, which meant DC's publications were barely making a profit in comparison after returns from the distributors were calculated while Marvel was making an excellent profit by comparison.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Reed |title=Slugfest: In the Epic 50-Year Battle between Marvel and DC |date=2017 |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=xiii }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Reed|title=Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=11\u201313}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach.

DC significantly lightened the [[tone (literature)|tone]] of many DC comics\u2014particularly ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]''\u2014to better complement the \"camp\" tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous \"Go-Go Checks\" [[Check (pattern)|checkerboard]] cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip (all DC books cover dated February 1966 until August 1967) at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC's output \"stand out on the newsracks\".<ref>[http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html#009267 \"Irwin Donenfeld, R.I.P.\" by Mark Evanier, December 1, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104754/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}.

With the growing popularity of upstart rival [[Marvel Comics]] threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero [[line (comics)|line]] to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] and promising newcomers [[Neal Adams]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Dick Giordano]], to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye.\n\n===Kinney National Company/Warner Communications subsidiary (1967-1990)===\nIn 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm |title=DC Comics |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> which purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[Warner Communications|Warner Communications Inc.]]\n\nIn 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]], in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively [[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]. In the existing series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' and in his own, newly launched series ''[[New Gods]]'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]'', Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain [[Darkseid]] and the other-dimensional realm [[Apokolips]]. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be reprinted in collected editions, in a publishing format that was later called the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], which became a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions soon became integral to the broadening of the DC Universe, especially after the major toy company, [[Kenner Products]], judged them ideal for their [[action figure]] adaptation of the [[DC Universe]], the [[Super Powers Collection]].,<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaiman|first=Mark Evanier ; introduction by Neil|title=Kirby : King of Comics|year=2008|publisher=Abrams|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8|page=197}}</ref> Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'', and ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'', before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics.\n\n===The Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}\n\nFollowing the science-fiction innovations of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], the comics of the 1970s and 1980s became known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the [[Comics Code Authority]], explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]]\" in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'', beginning with the story \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" in the retitled ''Green Lantern / Green Arrow'' #85 (September 1971), which depicted [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of superhero archer [[Green Arrow]], as having become a [[heroin]] addict.\n\n[[Jenette Kahn]], a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-[[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the [[Superman (1978 film)|first Superman movie]], Kahn expanded the [[line (comics)|line]] further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the \"DC Explosion\".<ref>Kahn, Jenette.

To that end\u2014and following the example of [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Mediascene |authorlink=Jim Steranko |last=Steranko |first=Jim |issue=11 |date=February 1975 |page=? |quote=Atlas/Seaboard publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] strategy is insidiously simple and outrageous\u2014possibly even considered dirty tactics by the competition\u2014[and consists of] such [things] as higher page rates, artwork returned to the artist, rights to the creation of an original character, and a certain amount of professional courtesy.}}</ref> and such independent companies as [[Eclipse Comics]]\u2014DC began to offer [[royalties]] in place of the industry-standard [[work for hire|work-for-hire]] agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, [[Jim Shooter]], was alienating much of his company's creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like [[Roy Thomas]], [[Gene Colan]], [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[George Perez]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |pages=112\u20133 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, emulating the era's new television form, the [[miniseries]] while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was ''[[World of Krypton]]'' in 1979, and its positive results lead to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like ''[[Camelot 3000]]'' for the direct market in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|title=GHM Columns : GHM Staff : Steve Higgins A+ Graphic Novels &#93|website=Newcomicreviews.com|access-date=March 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204110919/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|archive-date=February 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]], two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series ''[[X-Men]]'', but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales<ref>MacDonald, Heidi D. \"DC's Titanic Success\", ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 46\u201351.</ref> in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and P\u00e9rez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] title, ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'', to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}\n\nThis successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises|title=Why TEEN TITANS Is DC Comics' Most Important (But Undervalued) Franchise - Nerdist|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118073919/https://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises/|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to seek the same for the wider [[DC Universe]]. The result, the Wolfman/P\u00e9rez 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled ''The History of the DC Universe'', set out the revised history of the major DC characters. ''Crisis'' featured many key deaths that shaped the DC Universe for the following decades, and it separated the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Alan Moore]] had revitalized the horror series ''[[Swamp Thing|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', and soon numerous British writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Grant Morrison]], began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521|title=Vertigo (Publisher) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715180039/https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521/|archive-date=July 15, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTwo DC limited series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and ''[[Watchmen]]'' by Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |title=Batman's Dark Side |access-date=July 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407131449/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all |date=March 26, 2016 }}</ref> These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful [[trade paperbacks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC [[war comics]], including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included ''[[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]''.\n\n===Time Warner/AOL Time Warner/WarnerMedia unit (1990\u2013present)===\nIn March 1989, Warner Communications merged with [[Time Inc.]], making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the [[Batman (1989 film)|first Tim Burton directed Batman movie]] was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of [[DC Archive Editions]], collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, [[Bob LeRose]]. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between.\n\nThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that ''all'' comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]], [[Batman: Knightfall|Batman was crippled]] and superhero [[Emerald Twilight|''Green Lantern'' turned into the supervillain Parallax]] resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectables\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.\n\nDC's [[Piranha Press]] and other imprints (including the mature readers [[line (comics)|line]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections of individual serial comics, as well as original [[graphic novel]]s.\n\nOne of the other imprints was [[Impact Comics]] from 1991 to 1992 in which the [[Archie Comics]] superheroes were licensed and revamped.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arrant |first=Chris |title=Completing the Red Circle: Talking to JMS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224714/http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Markstein |first=Don |title=Archie (MLJ) Comics |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzfkTHvJWnIJ:www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm+http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm&cd=1&ct=clnk&gl=us |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.<ref name=cbr>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 \"JMS Circles the DC Universe in Red\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008225108/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 |date=October 8, 2013 }}.

Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''. DC established [[Paradox Press]] to publish material such as the large-format ''Big Book of...'' series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]''. In 1998, DC purchased [[WildStorm]] Comics, [[Jim Lee]]'s imprint under the [[Image Comics]] banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint \u2013 and [[Wildstorm Universe|fictional universe]] \u2013 with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint [[America's Best Comics (DC)|America's Best Comics]] (ABC), a series of titles created by [[Alan Moore]], including ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Tom Strong]]'', and ''[[Promethea]]''. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.\n\n===2000s===\nIn March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series ''[[Elfquest]]'', previously self-published by creators [[Wendy and Richard Pini]] under their [[WaRP Graphics]] publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, [[Tower Comics]]' series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]], in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] and [[Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s|Humanoids]]. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot [[Johnny DC]] and established the [[CMX (comics)|CMX]] imprint to reprint translated [[manga]]. In 2006, CMX took over from [[Dark Horse Comics]] publication of the webcomic ''[[Megatokyo]]'' in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and acquired the rights to much of the work of [[Will Eisner]], such as his ''[[The Spirit]]'' series and his graphic novels.\n\nIn 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event which similarly tried to [[Comics vocabulary#Retcon|ret-con]] the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded ''[[Batman Begins]]'' film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped [[One Year Later|forward a full year]] in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to gradually fill in the missing time.

The letters \"DC\" stood for ''Detective Comics'', the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication\".\n\nThe November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication\", effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC\".\n\nIn November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo also served as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's [[mascot]] in the 1960s.\n\nIn October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of ''Action Comics'', for example, read \"DC Superman\". An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as [[Anthology|anthologies]] like ''[[House of Mystery]]'' or team series such as ''Justice League of America'', the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a [[bat]] for \"House of Mystery\". This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as [[trademark]]s, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.\n\nDC's \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.\n\nThe July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that remained through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.\n\nIn December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that continued in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.\n\nWhen Jenette Kahn became DC's [[Publishing|publisher]] in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]] to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the [[DC Archive Editions]] series.\n\nIn July 1987, DC released variant editions of ''Justice League'' #3 and ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rozakis |first1=Bob |title=Conspiracy? Icons?

In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since ''[[Batman Begins]]'', with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and others, as well as for [[collectible]]s and other merchandise.

DC purchased many of their competitors' comic stables, including [[Fawcett Comics]], whose Beck-created Captain Marvel was central to a lawsuit with DC.]]\n\nThe company began to move aggressively against what it saw as [[copyright infringement|copyright-violating]] imitations from other companies, such as [[Fox Comics]]' [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]], which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing [[Fawcett Comics]] over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], at the time comics' top-selling character (see ''[[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]''). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC\u2014which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title ''Shazam!'' featuring artwork by his creator, [[C. C. Beck]]. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1967, with the creation of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|their Captain Marvel]], forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning [[Shazam! (TV series)|live action TV adaptation]] and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the [[DC Universe]].\n\nWhen the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as [[science fiction]], [[Western comics|Westerns]], [[humour|humor]], and [[Romance comics|romance]]. DC also published [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[Horror comics|horror]] titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including ''Action Comics'' and ''Detective Comics'', the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication.\n\n===Silver Age===\n{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}\n\nIn the mid-1950s, editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] and publisher Liebowitz directed editor [[Julius Schwartz]] (whose roots lay in the [[science-fiction]] book market) to produce a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] story in the try-out title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[penciller|penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[inker]] [[Joe Kubert]] create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's [[civilian]] identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in ''Showcase'' #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the [[Green Lantern]] character, the introduction of the modern all-star team [[Justice League of America]] (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comic books]].\n\nNational did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor [[Mort Weisinger]], introduced such enduring characters as [[Supergirl]], [[Bizarro]], and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful [[Batwoman]], [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.\n\nSince the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that, decades later, was dubbed the \"[[DC Universe]]\" by fans. With the story \"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\", in ''Flash'' #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artists Infantino and [[Joe Giella]]) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes' \"Earth 1\"\u2014in the process creating the foundation for what was later called the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]].\n\nDC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,{{refn|Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)<!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says \"National Comics\" in quote directly below this paragraph--> bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to [[publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]], which was being distributed by DC's Independent News at this time.) during a game of golf.\n<br /><br />\nHowever, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43\u201344\n{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue.

Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces&nbsp;... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.}}\n\nGoodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA's strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most.

Retrieved June 11, 2008.</ref> Reportedly, DC ignored the initial success of Marvel with this editorial change until its consistently strengthening sales, albeit also benefiting Independent News' business as their distributor as well, made that impossible. That commercial situation especially applied with Marvel's superior [[sell-through]] percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC's roughly 50%, which meant DC's publications were barely making a profit in comparison after returns from the distributors were calculated while Marvel was making an excellent profit by comparison.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Reed |title=Slugfest: In the Epic 50-Year Battle between Marvel and DC |date=2017 |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=xiii }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Reed|title=Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=11\u201313}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach.

DC significantly lightened the [[tone (literature)|tone]] of many DC comics\u2014particularly ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]''\u2014to better complement the \"camp\" tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous \"Go-Go Checks\" [[Check (pattern)|checkerboard]] cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip (all DC books cover dated February 1966 until August 1967) at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC's output \"stand out on the newsracks\".<ref>[http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html#009267 \"Irwin Donenfeld, R.I.P.\" by Mark Evanier, December 1, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104754/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}.

With the growing popularity of upstart rival [[Marvel Comics]] threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero [[line (comics)|line]] to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] and promising newcomers [[Neal Adams]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Dick Giordano]], to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye.\n\n===Kinney National Company/Warner Communications subsidiary (1967-1990)===\nIn 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm |title=DC Comics |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> which purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[Warner Communications|Warner Communications Inc.]]\n\nIn 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]], in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively [[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]. In the existing series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' and in his own, newly launched series ''[[New Gods]]'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]'', Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain [[Darkseid]] and the other-dimensional realm [[Apokolips]]. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be reprinted in collected editions, in a publishing format that was later called the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], which became a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions soon became integral to the broadening of the DC Universe, especially after the major toy company, [[Kenner Products]], judged them ideal for their [[action figure]] adaptation of the [[DC Universe]], the [[Super Powers Collection]].,<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaiman|first=Mark Evanier ; introduction by Neil|title=Kirby : King of Comics|year=2008|publisher=Abrams|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8|page=197}}</ref> Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'', and ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'', before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics.\n\n===The Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}\n\nFollowing the science-fiction innovations of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], the comics of the 1970s and 1980s became known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the [[Comics Code Authority]], explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]]\" in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'', beginning with the story \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" in the retitled ''Green Lantern / Green Arrow'' #85 (September 1971), which depicted [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of superhero archer [[Green Arrow]], as having become a [[heroin]] addict.\n\n[[Jenette Kahn]], a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-[[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the [[Superman (1978 film)|first Superman movie]], Kahn expanded the [[line (comics)|line]] further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the \"DC Explosion\".<ref>Kahn, Jenette. [http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/252/publishorial.gif \"Publishorial: Onward and Upward\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329065319/http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/252/publishorial.gif |date=March 29, 2014 }}, DC Comics cover-dated September 1978.</ref> The move was not successful, however, and corporate parent Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed \"the [[DC Implosion]]\".<ref>\"The DC Implosion\", ''The Comics Journal'' #41 (August 1978), pp. 5\u20137.</ref> In September 1978, the [[line (comics)|line]] was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still increased 40 cents.<ref>\"Post-Implosion Fill-In Fallout\", ''The Comics Journal'' #43 (December 1978), p. 13.</ref> By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books.\n\nSeeking new ways to boost [[market share]], the new team of publisher Kahn, vice president [[Paul Levitz]], and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end\u2014and following the example of [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Mediascene |authorlink=Jim Steranko |last=Steranko |first=Jim |issue=11 |date=February 1975 |page=? |quote=Atlas/Seaboard publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] strategy is insidiously simple and outrageous\u2014possibly even considered dirty tactics by the competition\u2014[and consists of] such [things] as higher page rates, artwork returned to the artist, rights to the creation of an original character, and a certain amount of professional courtesy.}}</ref> and such independent companies as [[Eclipse Comics]]\u2014DC began to offer [[royalties]] in place of the industry-standard [[work for hire|work-for-hire]] agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, [[Jim Shooter]], was alienating much of his company's creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like [[Roy Thomas]], [[Gene Colan]], [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[George Perez]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |pages=112\u20133 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, emulating the era's new television form, the [[miniseries]] while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was ''[[World of Krypton]]'' in 1979, and its positive results lead to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like ''[[Camelot 3000]]'' for the direct market in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|title=GHM Columns : GHM Staff : Steve Higgins A+ Graphic Novels &#93|website=Newcomicreviews.com|access-date=March 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204110919/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|archive-date=February 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]], two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series ''[[X-Men]]'', but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales<ref>MacDonald, Heidi D. \"DC's Titanic Success\", ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 46\u201351.</ref> in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and P\u00e9rez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] title, ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'', to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}\n\nThis successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises|title=Why TEEN TITANS Is DC Comics' Most Important (But Undervalued) Franchise - Nerdist|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118073919/https://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises/|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to seek the same for the wider [[DC Universe]]. The result, the Wolfman/P\u00e9rez 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled ''The History of the DC Universe'', set out the revised history of the major DC characters. ''Crisis'' featured many key deaths that shaped the DC Universe for the following decades, and it separated the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Alan Moore]] had revitalized the horror series ''[[Swamp Thing|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', and soon numerous British writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Grant Morrison]], began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521|title=Vertigo (Publisher) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715180039/https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521/|archive-date=July 15, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTwo DC limited series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and ''[[Watchmen]]'' by Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |title=Batman's Dark Side |access-date=July 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407131449/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all |date=March 26, 2016 }}</ref> These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful [[trade paperbacks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC [[war comics]], including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included ''[[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]''.\n\n===Time Warner/AOL Time Warner/WarnerMedia unit (1990\u2013present)===\nIn March 1989, Warner Communications merged with [[Time Inc.]], making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the [[Batman (1989 film)|first Tim Burton directed Batman movie]] was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of [[DC Archive Editions]], collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, [[Bob LeRose]]. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between.\n\nThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that ''all'' comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]], [[Batman: Knightfall|Batman was crippled]] and superhero [[Emerald Twilight|''Green Lantern'' turned into the supervillain Parallax]] resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectables\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.\n\nDC's [[Piranha Press]] and other imprints (including the mature readers [[line (comics)|line]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections of individual serial comics, as well as original [[graphic novel]]s.\n\nOne of the other imprints was [[Impact Comics]] from 1991 to 1992 in which the [[Archie Comics]] superheroes were licensed and revamped.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arrant |first=Chris |title=Completing the Red Circle: Talking to JMS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224714/http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Markstein |first=Don |title=Archie (MLJ) Comics |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzfkTHvJWnIJ:www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm+http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm&cd=1&ct=clnk&gl=us |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.<ref name=cbr>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 \"JMS Circles the DC Universe in Red\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008225108/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 |date=October 8, 2013 }}. Comic Book Resources. March 26, 2009</ref>\n\nDC entered into a publishing agreement with [[Milestone Media]] that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''. DC established [[Paradox Press]] to publish material such as the large-format ''Big Book of...'' series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]''. In 1998, DC purchased [[WildStorm]] Comics, [[Jim Lee]]'s imprint under the [[Image Comics]] banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint \u2013 and [[Wildstorm Universe|fictional universe]] \u2013 with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint [[America's Best Comics (DC)|America's Best Comics]] (ABC), a series of titles created by [[Alan Moore]], including ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Tom Strong]]'', and ''[[Promethea]]''. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.\n\n===2000s===\nIn March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series ''[[Elfquest]]'', previously self-published by creators [[Wendy and Richard Pini]] under their [[WaRP Graphics]] publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, [[Tower Comics]]' series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]], in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] and [[Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s|Humanoids]]. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot [[Johnny DC]] and established the [[CMX (comics)|CMX]] imprint to reprint translated [[manga]]. In 2006, CMX took over from [[Dark Horse Comics]] publication of the webcomic ''[[Megatokyo]]'' in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and acquired the rights to much of the work of [[Will Eisner]], such as his ''[[The Spirit]]'' series and his graphic novels.\n\nIn 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event which similarly tried to [[Comics vocabulary#Retcon|ret-con]] the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded ''[[Batman Begins]]'' film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped [[One Year Later|forward a full year]] in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to \"Superboy\" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of [[Jerry Siegel]] used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership.\n\nIn 2005, DC launched its \"[[All Star DC Comics|All-Star]]\" line (evoking the title of the [[All Star Comics|1940s publication]]), designed to feature some of the company's best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with ''All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder'' and ''All-Star Superman'', with ''All-Star Wonder Woman'' and ''All-Star Batgirl'' announced in 2006 but neither being released nor scheduled as of the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Matt |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |title=Adam Hughes on His New Exclusive & All Star Wonder Woman |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=August 21, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202046/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |archivedate=August 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDC licensed characters from the [[Archie Comics]] imprint [[Red Circle Comics]] by 2007.<ref>{{cite web |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |date=October 30, 2008 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |title=JMS Gets Brave & Bold with Archie Gang |publisher=ComicBookResources.com |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706132846/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |archive-date=July 6, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> They appeared in the Red Circle line, based in the DC Universe, with a series of [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] followed by a miniseries that lead into two ongoing titles, each lasting 10 issues.<ref name=\"cbr\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |title=20 Answers and 1 Question With Dan DiDio: Holiday Surprise |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=December 24, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829011736/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] storyline.

The letters \"DC\" stood for ''Detective Comics'', the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication\".\n\nThe November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication\", effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC\".\n\nIn November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo also served as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's [[mascot]] in the 1960s.\n\nIn October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of ''Action Comics'', for example, read \"DC Superman\". An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as [[Anthology|anthologies]] like ''[[House of Mystery]]'' or team series such as ''Justice League of America'', the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a [[bat]] for \"House of Mystery\". This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as [[trademark]]s, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.\n\nDC's \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.\n\nThe July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that remained through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.\n\nIn December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that continued in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.\n\nWhen Jenette Kahn became DC's [[Publishing|publisher]] in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]] to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the [[DC Archive Editions]] series.\n\nIn July 1987, DC released variant editions of ''Justice League'' #3 and ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rozakis |first1=Bob |title=Conspiracy? Icons?

In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since ''[[Batman Begins]]'', with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and others, as well as for [[collectible]]s and other merchandise.
