He was drafted by the [[Boston Celtics]] with the 18th overall pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]]. Known for his dunking skill, he has performed well in many slam dunk competitions, having won the 2005 McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest and the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game#Slam Dunk Contest|2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], while finishing as the runner-up in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game#Sprite Slam Dunk Contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web| url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/654/654675p1.html | title=Gerald Green: Color of Money | last=Robinson | first=Jon | work=[[IGN]] | date=2005-09-29 | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born in Houston, Texas. When he was in the 6th grade, he was involved in an accident that left a significant portion of his right [[ring finger]] cut off. He was wearing a ring on his right ring finger when he attempted a [[Slam dunk|dunk]] on a makeshift basketball hoop. The ring caught onto a nail on the goal and his finger was ripped, with [[amputation]] being the only option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/08/report-bucks-mirza-teletovic-expected-to-be-out-until-late-in-regular-season/|title=Gerald Green only has part of his ring finger on his right hand. Wait, what?|author=Matt Moore|work=Sports|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nGreen did not play high school basketball until his sophomore year, when he played junior [[Varsity team|varsity]] for [[J. Frank Dobie High School]]. In his junior year, he made the varsity team, but his play was cut short because of academic issues.<ref name=\"grantland.com\">http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7828599/the-improbable-return-nba-new-jersey-nets-gerald-green</ref>\n\nGreen transferred to a charter school, [[Gulf Shores Academy]] in Houston where he repeated his junior year.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/> In his senior year at Gulf Shores, he averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. He was named an All-American and was the high scorer with 24 points in the [[2005 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|2005 McDonald's All-American Game]],<ref>[http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp NBADraft.net | 2005 McDonald's All-American Game Recap<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180146/http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp |date=2008-05-14 }}</ref> which features two teams composed of the best high school basketball players in the United States. Green also won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest that year, defeating future [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] player [[Josh McRoberts]].\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Green was listed as the No. 1 player in the nation in 2005.<ref>[https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2005/gerald-green-35123 Gerald Green Recruiting Profile]</ref>\n\nGreen originally committed to [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State University]], but later decided to enter the [[NBA draft]] upon graduation. He hired an agent, thereby making himself ineligible to participate in [[NCAA]] athletics.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Draft===\nGreen was expected by many analysts to be one of the top players chosen but he fell to the Celtics, who selected him with the 18th pick in the [[NBA draft]]. His fall is attributed to his decision to give individual workouts only for the teams with the top six picks prior to the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\nGreen drew comparisons to former [[Houston Rockets]] teammate and star [[Tracy McGrady]] in the period leading up to the [[2005 NBA draft]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nGreen was one of the last players to enter the NBA directly from high school, as the collective bargaining agreement between NBA owners and the [[National Basketball Players Association]] now mandates that American players who enter the draft must be at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class and reach age 19 no later than December 31 of the calendar year of the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\n===Boston Celtics (2005\u20132007)===\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nDuring the pre-season, Green averaged 8 points and 1.3 rebounds per game for the Celtics in the 2005 Las Vegas Summer League.<ref>[http://www.vegassummerleague.com/teams.cfm?team=1 Boston Celtics summer league statistics]</ref>\n\nAfter seeing limited playing time during the first part of the season, Green was placed on the [[Fayetteville Patriots]] of the [[NBA D-League]] by the Celtics in January 2006. He was recalled and activated to an NBA roster position on February 3. He was reassigned to the NBDL, to the [[Florida Flame]], on February 16. He was recalled and activated again on February 21, and saw his first significant NBA game action on the following night, scoring 13 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in 23 minutes.\n\nHe appeared in 32 games and averaged 11.8 minutes, 5.2 points, and 1.2 rebounds during these contests. Green left marks on the league with his highlight plays including a shot clock beating half court three against Indiana and two ''[[SportsCenter]]'' top play dunks in the closing seconds in two games against the [[Toronto Raptors]].\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\nOver the off-season, Green aimed at improving all aspects of his game in order to gain playing time. He had shown flashes of his capability during the end of the 2005\u201306 season, but started off the 2006\u201307 season slowly, earning a somewhat limited role and playing time behind captain [[Paul Pierce]], and swingman [[Wally Szczerbiak]]. With injuries to Szczerbiak and Pierce, his playing time increased, but he was unable to nail down a starting role. Green started his first-ever game early December against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], but then lost his job to a returning Szczerbiak. Green finished the 2006\u201307 season averaging 10.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.\n\nOn February 17, 2007, Green won the 2007 [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], beating out [[Nate Robinson]], [[Tyrus Thomas]], and [[Dwight Howard]].\n\nThe season was going very well for Green. On March 16, 2007, he scored a career-high 25 points in a Celtics loss to the [[Dallas Mavericks]],<ref name=BOSATL/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270316006 Nowitzki, Howard help Mavs rebound from back-to-back losses]</ref> and on April 10, 2007, Green topped that with 33 points (12-22 FG, 4-5 3FG) at [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]].<ref name=BOSATL>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270410001 Hawks pull out victory in battle of shorthanded teams]</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2007 it was made official that Green was to be traded along with [[Al Jefferson]], [[Ryan Gomes]], [[Theo Ratliff]], [[Sebastian Telfair]], and draft picks, to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for [[Kevin Garnett]].<ref>[http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 Garnett deal finalized - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818092445/http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota Timberwolves (2007\u20132008)===\nAt Minnesota, Green found himself stuck on the bench behind a number of players at his same position. In early January 2008, Green's agent asked the Timberwolves to trade his client.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/01/26/green_wants_a_trade/ Green wants a trade]</ref>\n\nAt the [[2008 NBA slam dunk contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], Green opened the competition with a dunk he called \"The Birthday Cake\" in which he blew out a birthday candle on a cupcake set on the back of the rim while dunking.

He was drafted by the [[Boston Celtics]] with the 18th overall pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]]. Known for his dunking skill, he has performed well in many slam dunk competitions, having won the 2005 McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest and the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game#Slam Dunk Contest|2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], while finishing as the runner-up in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game#Sprite Slam Dunk Contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web| url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/654/654675p1.html | title=Gerald Green: Color of Money | last=Robinson | first=Jon | work=[[IGN]] | date=2005-09-29 | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born in Houston, Texas. When he was in the 6th grade, he was involved in an accident that left a significant portion of his right [[ring finger]] cut off. He was wearing a ring on his right ring finger when he attempted a [[Slam dunk|dunk]] on a makeshift basketball hoop. The ring caught onto a nail on the goal and his finger was ripped, with [[amputation]] being the only option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/08/report-bucks-mirza-teletovic-expected-to-be-out-until-late-in-regular-season/|title=Gerald Green only has part of his ring finger on his right hand. Wait, what?|author=Matt Moore|work=Sports|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nGreen did not play high school basketball until his sophomore year, when he played junior [[Varsity team|varsity]] for [[J. Frank Dobie High School]]. In his junior year, he made the varsity team, but his play was cut short because of academic issues.<ref name=\"grantland.com\">http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7828599/the-improbable-return-nba-new-jersey-nets-gerald-green</ref>\n\nGreen transferred to a charter school, [[Gulf Shores Academy]] in Houston where he repeated his junior year.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/> In his senior year at Gulf Shores, he averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. He was named an All-American and was the high scorer with 24 points in the [[2005 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|2005 McDonald's All-American Game]],<ref>[http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp NBADraft.net | 2005 McDonald's All-American Game Recap<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180146/http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp |date=2008-05-14 }}</ref> which features two teams composed of the best high school basketball players in the United States. Green also won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest that year, defeating future [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] player [[Josh McRoberts]].\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Green was listed as the No. 1 player in the nation in 2005.<ref>[https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2005/gerald-green-35123 Gerald Green Recruiting Profile]</ref>\n\nGreen originally committed to [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State University]], but later decided to enter the [[NBA draft]] upon graduation. He hired an agent, thereby making himself ineligible to participate in [[NCAA]] athletics.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Draft===\nGreen was expected by many analysts to be one of the top players chosen but he fell to the Celtics, who selected him with the 18th pick in the [[NBA draft]]. His fall is attributed to his decision to give individual workouts only for the teams with the top six picks prior to the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\nGreen drew comparisons to former [[Houston Rockets]] teammate and star [[Tracy McGrady]] in the period leading up to the [[2005 NBA draft]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nGreen was one of the last players to enter the NBA directly from high school, as the collective bargaining agreement between NBA owners and the [[National Basketball Players Association]] now mandates that American players who enter the draft must be at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class and reach age 19 no later than December 31 of the calendar year of the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\n===Boston Celtics (2005\u20132007)===\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nDuring the pre-season, Green averaged 8 points and 1.3 rebounds per game for the Celtics in the 2005 Las Vegas Summer League.<ref>[http://www.vegassummerleague.com/teams.cfm?team=1 Boston Celtics summer league statistics]</ref>\n\nAfter seeing limited playing time during the first part of the season, Green was placed on the [[Fayetteville Patriots]] of the [[NBA D-League]] by the Celtics in January 2006. He was recalled and activated to an NBA roster position on February 3. He was reassigned to the NBDL, to the [[Florida Flame]], on February 16. He was recalled and activated again on February 21, and saw his first significant NBA game action on the following night, scoring 13 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in 23 minutes.\n\nHe appeared in 32 games and averaged 11.8 minutes, 5.2 points, and 1.2 rebounds during these contests. Green left marks on the league with his highlight plays including a shot clock beating half court three against Indiana and two ''[[SportsCenter]]'' top play dunks in the closing seconds in two games against the [[Toronto Raptors]].\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\nOver the off-season, Green aimed at improving all aspects of his game in order to gain playing time. He had shown flashes of his capability during the end of the 2005\u201306 season, but started off the 2006\u201307 season slowly, earning a somewhat limited role and playing time behind captain [[Paul Pierce]], and swingman [[Wally Szczerbiak]]. With injuries to Szczerbiak and Pierce, his playing time increased, but he was unable to nail down a starting role. Green started his first-ever game early December against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], but then lost his job to a returning Szczerbiak. Green finished the 2006\u201307 season averaging 10.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.\n\nOn February 17, 2007, Green won the 2007 [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], beating out [[Nate Robinson]], [[Tyrus Thomas]], and [[Dwight Howard]].\n\nThe season was going very well for Green. On March 16, 2007, he scored a career-high 25 points in a Celtics loss to the [[Dallas Mavericks]],<ref name=BOSATL/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270316006 Nowitzki, Howard help Mavs rebound from back-to-back losses]</ref> and on April 10, 2007, Green topped that with 33 points (12-22 FG, 4-5 3FG) at [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]].<ref name=BOSATL>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270410001 Hawks pull out victory in battle of shorthanded teams]</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2007 it was made official that Green was to be traded along with [[Al Jefferson]], [[Ryan Gomes]], [[Theo Ratliff]], [[Sebastian Telfair]], and draft picks, to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for [[Kevin Garnett]].<ref>[http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 Garnett deal finalized - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818092445/http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota Timberwolves (2007\u20132008)===\nAt Minnesota, Green found himself stuck on the bench behind a number of players at his same position. In early January 2008, Green's agent asked the Timberwolves to trade his client.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/01/26/green_wants_a_trade/ Green wants a trade]</ref>\n\nAt the [[2008 NBA slam dunk contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], Green opened the competition with a dunk he called \"The Birthday Cake\" in which he blew out a birthday candle on a cupcake set on the back of the rim while dunking. He followed that up with an alley-oop two-handed windmill. His first dunk of the second round was an alley-oop from behind the basket which he put between his legs before dunking. His final dunk of the night was a between-the-legs one-handed slam that he performed after taking off his shoes. He ended up finishing second to [[Dwight Howard]], after Howard received seventy-eight percent of the votes cast by fans through text message.<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/other_nba/view.bg?articleid=1074114&srvc=rss Howard ends Green\u2019s reign - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/tnt/allstar/nba_dunk_best_021708.asx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225044834/http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/tnt/allstar/nba_dunk_best_021708.asx |archivedate=2008-12-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Houston Rockets (2008)===\nOn February 21, 2008, Green was traded to his hometown team [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Kirk Snyder]], a [[Paul\u00e3o Prestes|2010 second-round draft]] pick, and cash considerations. He was subsequently released by the Rockets on March 8<ref name=\"nba.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/nba_news/rockets_mikeharris_080308.html |title=Rockets Sign Mike Harris to 10-Day Contract |access-date=2008-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130112358/http://www.nba.com/nba_news/rockets_mikeharris_080308.html |archive-date=2016-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and became an unrestricted free agent in July.\n\n===Dallas Mavericks (2008\u20132009)===\nOn July 1, 2008, Green signed with the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. His agent Colin Bryant told [[KRIV (TV)|Fox 26]] Sports, \"We have a verbal agreement with Dallas on a one year contract, We talked to a number of teams and there is more money out there, but this is the best situation for Gerald at this point in his career.\"<ref>[http://www.myfoxhouston.com/myfox/pages/Sports/Detail?contentId=6892540&version=1&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=6.1.1 MyFox Houston | Gerald Green to Join Dallas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nGreen was not supposed to go to the summer league, but chose to go to learn the plays and get a feeling of the Mavericks organization early and not let his chance slip away. In the [[Vegas Summer League]] he averaged an underwhelming 13.3 ppg and 3.8 rpg on 38% shooting from the field. On a bright note, he was 43% from beyond the arc. Following the Vegas Summer League, the Mavericks and Green participated in the [[Rocky Mountain Revue]], a summer league held in Salt Lake City, Utah. There in just 25.8 mpg Green averaged 17.7 ppg to go with 2.7 rpg, 1.8 apg, 1 spg, .5 bpg, and a respectable 2.2 topg. This time around, Green shot a much more impressive 45%, including going 12 for 26 from behind the three point line (46%), and 28-31 from the free throw line (90%). His overall performance was enough to earn him All-Revue Team honors.\n\n===Outside the NBA (2009\u20132011)===\nGreen signed with [[PBC Lokomotiv Kuban]] of Russia on December 2009.<ref name=\"realgm\">[http://realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/63428/20091215/gerald_green_signs_with_russian_team/ Gerald Green Signs With Russian Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218173602/http://realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/63428/20091215/gerald_green_signs_with_russian_team |date=2010-02-18 }}.

Upon loading, one of the codes from the card had to be entered before the game would start. Although the cassette could be duplicated, a copy of the card was also needed and at the time, home colour reproduction was difficult,<ref>Aycock, J. and Reinhard, A. 2017 Copy Protection in Jet Set Willy: developing methodology for retrogame archaeology, Internet Archaeology 45. https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.45.2</ref> making ''Jet Set Willy'' harder to copy than most Spectrum games.

The foundation stone was laid by [[Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff]], the second President of the Orange Free State Republic, on 13 October 1856.\n\nThe school was officially opened on 17 January 1859 and the first headmaster was the [[Andrew Murray (minister)|Reverend Andrew Murray]]. It is the third-oldest school in South Africa and the oldest north of the [[Orange River]].<ref name=\"top20highschools\" />\n\nDuring his presidential inauguration speech in 1896, while addressing learners from Grey College, [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn]] mentioned that he envisioned a university for [[Bloemfontein]] where youth from all over the country could come and study. He supported the idea that Grey College should provide higher education to the people of the [[Orange Free State]]. As a result the [[University of the Free State]] essentially came into existence in 1904 when a tertiary portion of Grey College were allocated for such purpose.<ref>''Marthinus Theunis Steyn'', regsman staatsman en volksman, M.C.E. van Schoor, Protea Boekhuis Pretoria 2009, p. 87 </ref>\n\nThe college first accepted [[Matriculation in South Africa|matriculants]] for a full [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] course in 1904. In 1906 the tertiary part of Grey College became known as the Grey University College (GUC), but shortly thereafter the school and college separated. GUC grew and evolved into the institution now called the [[University of the Free State]].\n\n[[Afrikaans]]- and English-speaking pupils study under one roof, but each language group is educated in separate classrooms and in its own mother tongue.\n\n==Grey College today==\nThe school grounds consist of a number of historic buildings, of which five are Free State [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]]: the Main building and Hamilton Hall,<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0056 - Main building and Hamilton Hall, Grey College, Bloemfontein|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/content/923020056|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060850/http://www.sahra.org.za/content/923020056|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the Andrew Murray House,<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0057 - Andrew Murray House, Grey College, Jock Meiring Street, Bloemfontein\n|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19432|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]}}</ref> the Brill House<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0058 - Brill House, Grey College, Jock Meiring Street, Bloemfontein|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19433|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]}}</ref> and the Tuck shop.<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0059 - Tuck shop, Grey College, Jock Meiring Street, Bloemfontein|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19434|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]}}</ref>\n\nExtensive sport facilities includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a hockey astro, squash courts and several hockey, soccer, cricket and rugby fields. The school also has 16 all-weather tennis courts.\n\nThe school celebrated its 150th jubilee during October 2005, when numerous alumni visited their alma mater. The current headmaster at the High School is Deon Scheepers and the headmaster of the Primary School is Jurie Geldenhuys. A Museum which houses memorable artifacts, such as old rugby jerseys, and paintings, was unveiled in 2005. Each year on 13 October many old-boys hold a reunion.\n\nIn 2001 the school won the [[Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament]].\n\nA trademark of the school is the unique handshake, widely recognized and

African province)|Free State]] province of [[South Africa]], it is one of the 23 [[The Milner Schools|Milner Schools]], It is one of the top schools in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] province. The sister school is [[Eunice High School|Eunice Girls' High School]].\n\nGrey College was ranked 1st out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003 and 2013, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility.<ref name=\"top20highschools\">{{cite web |url= http://www.africaalmanac.com/top20highschools.html |title= top20highschools |date= 1 October 2003 |website= Africa Almanac |publisher= Africa Almanac |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070114052056/http://www.africaalmanac.com/top20highschools.html#11 |archive-date= 14 January 2007 |url-status= dead |access-date= 19 June 2016 |quote= The research leading up to the publication of the 100 Best High Schools in Africa began with the launching of the website in December 2000.}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nGrey College was founded on 13 October 1855 when [[George Grey|Sir George Grey]], the then Governor of the [[Cape Colony]], paid a visit to the [[Orange Free State|Orange Free State Republic]] and donated a sum of money towards the establishment of a school in Bloemfontein. The foundation stone was laid by [[Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff]], the second President of the Orange Free State Republic, on 13 October 1856.\n\nThe school was officially opened on 17 January 1859 and the first headmaster was the [[Andrew Murray (minister)|Reverend Andrew Murray]]. It is the third-oldest school in South Africa and the oldest north of the [[Orange River]].<ref name=\"top20highschools\" />\n\nDuring his presidential inauguration speech in 1896, while addressing learners from Grey College, [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn]] mentioned that he envisioned a university for [[Bloemfontein]] where youth from all over the country could come and study. He supported the idea that Grey College should provide higher education to the people of the [[Orange Free State]]. As a result the [[University of the Free State]] essentially came into existence in 1904 when a tertiary portion of Grey College were allocated for such purpose.<ref>''Marthinus Theunis Steyn'', regsman staatsman en volksman, M.C.E. van Schoor, Protea Boekhuis Pretoria 2009, p. 87 </ref>\n\nThe college first accepted [[Matriculation in South Africa|matriculants]] for a full [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] course in 1904. In 1906 the tertiary part of Grey College became known as the Grey University College (GUC), but shortly thereafter the school and college separated. GUC grew and evolved into the institution now called the [[University of the Free State]].\n\n[[Afrikaans]]- and English-speaking pupils study under one roof, but each language group is educated in separate classrooms and in its own mother tongue.\n\n==Grey College today==\nThe school grounds consist of a number of historic buildings, of which five are Free State [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]]: the Main building and Hamilton Hall,<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0056 - Main building and Hamilton Hall, Grey College, Bloemfontein|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/content/923020056|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060850/http://www.sahra.org.za/content/923020056|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the Andrew Murray House,<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0057 - Andrew Murray House, Grey College, Jock Meiring Street, Bloemfontein\n|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19432|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]}}</ref> the Brill House<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0058 - Brill House, Grey College, Jock Meiring Street, Bloemfontein|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19433|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]}}</ref> and the Tuck shop.<ref>{{cite web|title=9/2/302/0059 - Tuck shop, Grey College, Jock Meiring Street, Bloemfontein|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19434|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]}}</ref>\n\nExtensive sport facilities includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a hockey astro, squash courts and several hockey, soccer, cricket and rugby fields. The school also has 16 all-weather tennis courts.\n\nThe school celebrated its 150th jubilee during October 2005, when numerous alumni visited their alma mater. The current headmaster at the High School is Deon Scheepers and the headmaster of the Primary School is Jurie Geldenhuys. A Museum which houses memorable artifacts, such as old rugby jerseys, and paintings, was unveiled in 2005. Each year on 13 October many old-boys hold a reunion.\n\nIn 2001 the school won the [[Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament]].\n\nA trademark of the school is the unique handshake, widely recognized and used by students, old boys and members of staff.\n\nThe school offers a number of scholarships such as the Badawi Legacy scholarship given in partnership with [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault Rugby|Montpellier Rugby Club]] to promote rugby, education and French culture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/french-top14-club-invest-in-grey-college-20170919|title=French Top14 club invest in Grey College|last=|first=|date=19 September 2017|work=Sport|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}</ref>  Old Greys donate funds to the Jock Meiring Trust and [[Bram Fischer|Bram Fisher Trust]], funds used for the administration of school grounds and granting of scholarships..<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/bullied-grey-college-pupil-sent-to-school-with-bodyguard-20181022|title=Bullied Grey College pupil sent to school with bodyguard|last=|first=|date=22 October 2018|work=News24|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Grey College.JPG|Main Building\nImage:Tuck Shop.jpg|The Tuck Shop\nImage:Hamilton Hall, Grey College - panoramio.jpg|Hamilton Hall\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n*[[Laurens van der Post]] Sir Laurens van der Post was political adviser to British heads of government, close friend of [[Prince Charles]], godfather of [[Prince William]], educator, journalist, humanitarian, philosopher, explorer and conservationist.\n*Prof. [[Ernst Oswald Johannes Westphal]], internationally renowned linguist and scholar, of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and the [[University of Cape Town]].\n*[[Jopie Fourie]], military scout & dispatch rider \n* [[Etienne Leroux]], Influential Afrikaans author and a key member of the South African Sestigers literary movement.\n*[[Charl du Plessis (pianist)|Charl du Plessis]], Internationally renowned pianist.\n* [[Louis Brabow]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] rugby player.\n* [[Heinrich Br\u00fcssow]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] rugby player\n* [[Hansie Cronj\u00e9]], former South African cricket captain, whose ashes are kept at the school\n* [[Johan Cronj\u00e9]], South African Olympic Athlete\n* [[Naka Drotsk\u00e9]], Rugby World Cup 1995 winning [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] team\n* [[Bismarck du Plessis]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] rugby player\n* [[Jannie du Plessis]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] rugby player;
