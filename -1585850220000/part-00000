He improved to 31-2, with one draw, while Sylvester fell to 31-3.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/11/02/sports/BOX-Sturm-Sylvester.php iht.com, Sturm wins decision over Sylvester]</ref>\n\nOn July 11, 2009 he defended his title against [[Khoren Gevor]] in [[Nuerburg]], [[Germany]] in 12 rounds.\n\nAfter over a year of inactivity Sturm came back to defend his WBA title against Giovanni Lorenzo, with the winner becoming the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] \"Super\" champion. Sturm defeated Lorenzo by a twelve round unanimous decision with the judges giving a comfortable 117-111 twice and 118-111 on the scorecards.\n\nAfter defeating top contenders [[Matthew Macklin]] and [[Sebastian Zbik]] he lost his WBA title to Australian Daniel Geale. Geale's IBF title was also on the line.<ref>[http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/8327456/ibf-champ-daniel-geale-beats-felix-sturm-claim-wba-title espn.com, Daniel Geale claims WBA title]</ref>\n\n====IBF champion====\nIn 2013 he became Germany's first four-time world champion by defeating [[Darren Barker]] in Stuttgart. Barker was in no condition to continue after suffering a serious hip injury. Barker's IBF title was on the line. One month later the Englishman announced his retirement from boxing. <ref>[http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/9117175/former-ibf-world-middleweight-champion-darren-barker-confirms-retirement-from-boxing skysports.com, Former IBF world middleweight champion Darren Barker confirms retirement from boxing]</ref>\n\nIn mid 2014 Sturm lost his title against [[Sam Soliman]] via unanimous decision.

Later after the fight, the doping samples that were taken from Sturm before the fight were suddenly challenged,  however, the sample documents were not complete, as the location,  time of arrival was not documented. Due to this inaccuracy, Sturm was not stripped of his titles. He then relocated to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n====Doping allegations====\nHe broke the silence two months later with a post which he shared via [[Instagram]] where he complained about being treated unfairly by the doping investigators. Sturm wrote that he was only informed two months after the first doping sample about the results and that he wasn't told why it took longer than usual (two weeks). After engaging a lawyer who requested all the required documents from the investigators he noticed that the last page was missing, \"...where is written, when my sample arrived at the laboratory, who received it and who analysed the sample.\", it was written in that social media post. He allegedly didn't get an answer after submitting further inquiries and was denied the right to let the b-sample be analysed by another laboratory. Sturm claimed that the WBA refrained from suspending him because of these irregularities.<ref>[http://www.sport1.de/boxen/2016/12/boxen-felix-sturm-schiesst-gegen-doping-ermittler sport1.de, Sturm

Six months earlier he had qualified for the [[Olympic Games]] in [[Sydney]], but lost his fight to future middleweight champ [[Jermain Taylor]].\n\nAfter 16 successful matches, Sturm won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Inter-Continental middleweight title on 10 May 2003. On 13 September 2003, he replaced the injured [[Bert Schenk]] in a WBO title bout against Argentinian [[Hect\u00f3r Javier Velazco]] and won the match.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/ueberraschung-im-mittelgewicht-felix-sturm-ist-neuer-wbo-champion-a-265586.html spiegel.de, Felix Sturm is the new WBO champion (german)]</ref> Sturm defended the title against Rub\u00e9n Var\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez from [[Spain]].\n\n====Sturm vs. De La Hoya====\n{{Main article|Felix Sturm vs. Oscar De La Hoya}}\nOn 5 June 2004 in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], Sturm faced [[Oscar De La Hoya]] in a defense of his WBO middleweight championship. All three judges scored the fight 115-113 for De La Hoya, while [[Harold Lederman]] scored the fight 115-113 for Sturm. [[Compubox]] counted Sturm as landing 234 of 541 punches, while counting De La Hoya as landing 188 of 792. Sturm protested the decision with the [[Nevada Athletic Commission]] to no avail.<ref>[http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=1816616 espn.com, De La Hoya wins controversial decision]</ref><ref>[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/boxen-keine-revanche-fuer-sturm-gegen-de-la-hoya-1161661.html faz.net, No rematch for Sturm against de la Hoya (german)]</ref>\n\n====WBA champion====\nOn 11 March 2006, Sturm defeated [[Maselino Masoe]] for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] middleweight title by a unanimous decision.<ref>[http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2364401 espn.com, Sturm defeats Masoe in unanimous decision]</ref> Sturm then lost his title against former champion [[Javier Castillejo]] via TKO on 15 July 2006<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/5184206.stm bbc.co.uk, Castillejo KOs Sturm to win title]</ref> but won it back from Castillejo in a rematch on 28 April 2007 by a twelve round unanimous decision in Oberhausen, which he earned after defeating Gavin Topp by TKO in the sixth round.\n\nSturm became a three-time world champion after defeating Castillejo in the rematch.\n\nHe also fought [[Randy Griffin]] twice, drawing with him in their first fight and winning their second fight by unanimous decision.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/3781475/sturm-sees-off-griffin skysports.com, Sturm sees off Griffin]</ref>\n\nOn November 2, 2008, Sturm retained his WBA middleweight title via unanimous decision (118-110, 118-110 and 119-109) over [[Sebastian Sylvester]]. He improved to 31-2, with one draw, while Sylvester fell to 31-3.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/11/02/sports/BOX-Sturm-Sylvester.php iht.com, Sturm wins decision over Sylvester]</ref>\n\nOn July 11, 2009 he defended his title against [[Khoren Gevor]] in [[Nuerburg]], [[Germany]] in 12 rounds.\n\nAfter over a year of inactivity Sturm came back to defend his WBA title against Giovanni Lorenzo, with the winner becoming the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] \"Super\" champion. Sturm defeated Lorenzo by a twelve round unanimous decision with the judges giving a comfortable 117-111 twice and 118-111 on the scorecards.\n\nAfter defeating top contenders [[Matthew Macklin]] and [[Sebastian Zbik]] he lost his WBA title to Australian Daniel Geale. Geale's IBF title was also on the line.<ref>[http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/8327456/ibf-champ-daniel-geale-beats-felix-sturm-claim-wba-title espn.com, Daniel Geale claims WBA title]</ref>\n\n====IBF champion====\nIn 2013 he became Germany's first four-time world champion by defeating [[Darren Barker]] in Stuttgart. Barker was in no condition to continue after suffering a serious hip injury. Barker's IBF title was on the line. One month later the Englishman announced his retirement from boxing. <ref>[http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/9117175/former-ibf-world-middleweight-champion-darren-barker-confirms-retirement-from-boxing skysports.com, Former IBF world middleweight champion Darren Barker confirms retirement from boxing]</ref>\n\nIn mid 2014 Sturm lost his title against [[Sam Soliman]] via unanimous decision.

Later after the fight, the doping samples that were taken from Sturm before the fight were suddenly challenged,  however, the sample documents were not complete, as the location,  time of arrival was not documented. Due to this inaccuracy, Sturm was not stripped of his titles. He then relocated to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n====Doping allegations====\nHe broke the silence two months later with a post which he shared via [[Instagram]] where he complained about being treated unfairly by the doping investigators. Sturm wrote that he was only informed two months after the first doping sample about the results and that he wasn't told why it took longer than usual (two weeks). After engaging a lawyer who requested all the required documents from the investigators he noticed that the last page was missing, \"...where is written, when my sample arrived at the laboratory, who received it and who analysed the sample.\", it was written in that social media post. He allegedly didn't get an answer after submitting further inquiries and was denied the right to let the b-sample be analysed by another laboratory. Sturm claimed that the WBA refrained from suspending him because of these irregularities.<ref>[http://www.sport1.de/boxen/2016/12/boxen-felix-sturm-schiesst-gegen-doping-ermittler sport1.de, Sturm

During the 1970s the company developed the concept of cable/satellite connection, which, in working with [[HBO]] and transportable earth stations developed by [[TelePrompTer Corporation]] and manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, established satellite-delivered television for the cable industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Hall of Fame 1998 - 2010 Honorees Sid Topol {{!}}|url=http://www.cablecenter.org/content.cfm?id=1055 | publisher =The Cable Center | accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s Scientific-Atlanta earned a place in the space and defense industries as a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment for antennae. By the end of that decade the company had added instruments for testing telephones and acoustic devices with defense applications. As a military contractor, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing unique electronic instruments for the federal government. According to ''Business Week'', Scientific-Atlanta was a company \"fascinated with communications esoterica.\"\n\nScientific-Atlanta applied its energy to opportunities in new fields with large growth potential and few barriers to entry. The company sought out products that were either low-cost and high volume or had a very high price tag. \"You've either got to make 10,000 of something worth $100 to $200, or several of something worth $500,000 or $10 million,\" Topol told the ''New York Times''. The company planned to make the low-cost, high volume end of this equation profitable through aggressive research and development and a strong marketing effort. In its annual report, as reprinted in David C. Rickert's Harvard Business School case study of Scientific-Atlanta, the company stated: \"Scientific-Atlanta operates under a disciplined business plan that concentrates on design, manufacture, and sale of standard technical products for the communications and instrumentation markets.\" More specifically, Topol recounted in Dun's Review, as restated by Rickert, \"I asked what products we needed for growing markets, not what markets we should go after because we had a product.\"\n\nThe answer to that question was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.\n\nThese predictions proved incorrect and as the cable television industry boomed in the mid- to late 1970s, Scientific-Atlanta grew with it. The company's profits ballooned by 40 percent a year from 1972 on as Scientific-Atlanta came to dominate the market it had largely pioneered. In 1976, as sales rose to more than $45 million, the company greatly expanded its manufacturing, laboratory, and office space at its headquarters. It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients\u2014broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel\u2014to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.\n\nIn addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.\n\nBy the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.\n\nIn addition to its two main areas of operation\u2014communications and instrumentation\u2014Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.\n\nIn August 2002, the company laid off  6 percent of the company's total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020908080838/http://hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|title=Scientific-Atlanta Cuts 400 Jobs|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=September 8, 2002|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying [[HDTV]] programming, at [[Best Buy]] stores in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. It was later rolled out nationwide. In March 2004, Scientific-Atlanta launched the Explorer 8000HD, their first set-top box with both DVR and HD.\n\nIn the set-top arena, Scientific-Atlanta once enjoyed 100% market share with [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cablevision]] and [[AT&T U-verse]]; all three companies have since started to transition to other boxes, Cablevision using [[Samsung]], while TWC and U-verse are split between SA/Cisco and competitor [[Arris International|Arris]] (formerly Motorola). [[Comcast]] also has a split account with the two companies. Other companies that have split accounts with SA and Arris are [[Suddenlink Communications]], [[Charter Communications]] and [[Cox Communications|Cox]]; the two vendors also had split accounts for [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] before that company went under in 2006. [[Pace plc]], who mainly competes in foreign markets, serves as a domestic rival, but on a limited scale.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Scientific Atlanta announced that it would be purchased by [[Cisco Systems]] in a US$6.9 billion cash deal. On February 25, 2006, Cisco Systems announced that it had completed acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in a cash deal that paid $43 per share. The total cash value of the deal was roughly US$7 billion, or US$5.1 billion net of Scientific Atlanta's cash balance, and also about US$5.1 billion over their 2005 [[shareholders' equity]]. In its fiscal year 2005, Scientific Atlanta earned $1.36 per common share (diluted).\n\nOn November 21, 2015, Cisco completed sale of its Connected Devices Business Unit (CDBU) to [[Technicolor SA]]. <ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/technicolor.html#~overview</ref> This business was comprised primarily by customer premises equipment (CPE) related hardware and software that had originated at Scientific Atlanta, including set top boxes, cable gateways / modems, CableCard devices, digital transport adapters, wireless video access points, network extenders, accessories and eleven software products related to these offerings.<ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/docs/connected-devices.pdf</ref>\n\nThe company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development of interactive video on demand infrastructure and signaling, leading to large scale [[Video on demand|VOD]] implementations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.scientificatlanta.com/ Scientific Atlanta official site]\n\n{{Atlanta companies}}\n\n[[Category:Scientific Atlanta| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Gwinnett County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Computer companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:Cisco Systems acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Computer companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:2006 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications equipment vendors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Scientific Atlanta, Inc.\n| logo             = Scientific Atlanta logo.svg\n| logo_caption     = The Scientific Atlanta logo after Cisco's acquisition\n| type             = [[Subsidiary]]\n| genre            = \n| fate             = \n| predecessor      = \n| successor        = \n| foundation       = {{Start date and age|1951}}\n| founders         = [[James E.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, Russian General Aleksandr Kodoroff, along with a rogue [[Spetznaz]] unit, kills the soldiers on board the transport train and transfers nine of the warheads to another train. Kodoroff then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and sends the transport on a collision course with a passenger train. Minutes later, the 500-kiloton warhead detonates, killing the survivors and delaying an investigation.\n\nThe detonation immediately attracts the attention of the U.S. government. White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly believes that [[Chechens|Chechen]] terrorists are behind the incident. [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that the crash and detonation were staged to hide the hijacking of the other warheads. A call to Devoe's long-time friend and Russian counterpart, Dimitri Vertikoff, adds credence to his hypothesis and he is assigned as Dr. Kelly's military liaison.\n\nKelly and Devoe try to track the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia. When the Mafia realizes they are U.S. government agents, they send thugs to kill them. Vertikoff, attempting to pay them off, is killed. Devoe kills most of the would-be assassins, and he and Kelly escape. Information from the trucking company shows that the nukes are going to [[Iran]]. Spy satellites place the truck in a traffic jam in [[Dagestan]], and Devoe uses a ruse to identify it. The satellite, tracking in real time, is able to verify its license plate.\n\nStopped at a checkpoint, Kodoroff and his men kill the guards. Devoe then leads a U.S. special operations unit to stop them. Denied entry into Russian airspace, one of the helicopters is shot down by a Russian [[surface-to-air missile]] battery, but the remaining helicopters are able to locate the truck carrying the warheads. A gunfight ensues in which Kodoroff is killed and the warheads are seized. Interrogation of the surviving member of the group reveals that one warhead was taken by another man who was able to escape before the truck was intercepted.\n\nFurther work on the information from the trucking company leads [[Implementation Force|IFOR]] to a [[Sarajevo]] address. Inside is a video cassette of a Yugoslav named Du\u0161an Gavri\u0107. Gavri\u0107 disclaims any allegiance in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (\"I am a Serb, a Croat, and a Muslim\"), but blames other countries for supplying weapons to all sides in the war. Dr. Kelly realizes he intends to bomb a meeting at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City and the city goes into lockdown. Gavri\u0107 arrives in Manhattan with the Bosnian diplomatic delegation. A flashback shows that Gavri\u0107 wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter, who were killed in Sarajevo. He and his brother are finally found by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. When his brother is killed by Devoe, a wounded Gavri\u0107 is followed into a parochial school and then a church. Devoe confronts Gavri\u0107, who commits suicide, knowing that the bomb is set to go off in a matter of minutes and cannot be deactivated. With only seconds to spare, Dr. Kelly is able to remove a part of the [[explosive lens]] shell of the bomb, stopping the primary explosion from establishing [[critical mass]] within the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|plutonium core]]. The primary wrecks the church, but the warhead itself does not detonate. Devoe and Kelly both survive with minor injuries. After the nuclear attack is over, Julia spends her free time swimming and Devoe stops by and ask her for a drink, which she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Lt. Col.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, Russian General Aleksandr Kodoroff, along with a rogue [[Spetznaz]] unit, kills the soldiers on board the transport train and transfers nine of the warheads to another train. Kodoroff then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and sends the transport on a collision course with a passenger train. Minutes later, the 500-kiloton warhead detonates, killing the survivors and delaying an investigation.\n\nThe detonation immediately attracts the attention of the U.S. government.

Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan \"[[city upon a hill]]\" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies.\n\nWinthrop was born into a wealthy land-owning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became [[Lord of the Manor]] at [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]] in [[Suffolk]].  He was not involved in founding the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] began a crackdown on [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] religious thought. In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the [[New World]] in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the [[Charles River]].\n\nBetween 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative [[Thomas Dudley]] and the more liberal [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]]. Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it \"the meanest and worst of all forms of government\".<ref name=Mor92/> The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.\n\nWinthrop's son [[John Winthrop the Younger|John]] was one of the founders of the [[Connecticut Colony]], and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period. His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.\n\n==Life in England==\nJohn Winthrop was born on January 12, 1587/8<ref name=dates>In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on March 25.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years.

Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 107</ref> The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnWinthropJr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Winthrop's eldest son [[John Winthrop the Younger]]]]\nWinthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings.<ref name=B91/><ref>Morison, p. 59</ref> In it, he described his failures to keep \"divers vows\" and sought to reform his failings by God's grace, praying that God would \"give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me\".<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 96</ref> He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that \"she proved after a right godly woman.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 97</ref> He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.<ref>Morison, p. 60</ref>\n\nHis wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time by marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on December 6, 1615. She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was \"truly religious & industrious therein\".<ref name=B103/> Thomasine died on December 8, 1616 from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.<ref name=B103>Bremer (2003), p. 103</ref>\n\nIn approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at [[Gray's Inn]].  There he read the law but did not advance to the Bar.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 101</ref> His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of [[Great Maplestead]], [[Essex]], and he began courting [[Margaret Tyndal Winthrop|Margaret Tyndal]] in 1617, the daughter of [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] judge Sir John Tyndal and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of Puritan preacher [[Stephen Egerton (clergyman)|Stephen Egerton]]. Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds;<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 112\u2013113</ref> Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue which more than compensated for his modest income. The couple were married on April 29, 1618 at [[Great Maplestead]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 115</ref> They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]]. His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 117\u2013125</ref>\n\n===Decision to emigrate===\nIn the mid- to late-1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the [[English Reformation]] was in danger. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic. Charles was opposed to all manner of [[recusant]]s and supported the [[Church of England]] in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices.<ref name=M64/> This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the [[New World]] as a viable means to escape persecution.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 138</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnEndecottPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Endecott]] preceded Winthrop as governor in Massachusetts]]\nThe first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the [[Plymouth Colony]] on the shores of [[Cape Cod Bay]].<ref>Morison, p. 12</ref> Pastor [[John White (colonist priest)|John White]] led a short-lived effort to establish a colony at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624, also on the Massachusetts coast.<ref>Morison, pp. 28\u201329</ref> In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the [[Charles River|Charles]] and [[Merrimack River]]s. It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory.<ref>Morison, pp. 31\u201334</ref>  Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by [[John Endecott]] to prepare the way for further migration.<ref>Morison, p. 35</ref> John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which primarily involved individuals from [[Lincolnshire]]; however, he was probably aware of the company's activities and plans by early 1629. The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company because there were many indirect connections between him and individuals associated with the company.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 153\u2013155</ref> Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son [[Henry Winthrop|Henry]] became involved in efforts to settle [[Barbados]] in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.<ref>Manegold, pp. 8\u201312</ref>\n\nIn March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning [[Personal Rule|eleven years of rule]] without Parliament.<ref name=M64>Morison, p. 64</ref> This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor [[Matthew Cradock]] proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 156</ref> It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. He wrote, \"If the Lord seeth it wilbe<!--sic--> good for us, he will provide a shelter & a hidinge place for us and others\".<ref name=M64/> During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration, and he circulated a paper on August 12 providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 157\u2013158</ref> His name appears in formal connection with the company on the [[Cambridge Agreement]] signed August 26; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.<ref>Morison, p. 69</ref>\n\nThe company shareholders met on October 20 to enact the changes agreed to in August. Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen. Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election. The other two were [[Richard Saltonstall]] and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 161</ref> Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration.<ref>Moore, p. 277</ref> Winthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration. He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony's spiritual needs.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 164</ref>\n\nIt was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet's departure time. They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time, and it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 162, 203</ref> To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 169</ref> Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John, Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 162</ref> By April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order, although Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute. The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John, Jr. left for the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 168</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:The Coat of Arms of John Winthrop (1587-1649).gif|thumb|The coat of arms of John Winthrop]]\n\nJohn Winthrop used a [[coat of arms]] that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the [[College of Arms]], London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]. It is also the coat of arms for [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son [[Deane Winthrop]] at the [[Deane Winthrop House]]. The heraldic [[blazon]] of arms is ''Argent three chevronels Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Arms of the Founders and Leaders of European Settlements in the Present-Day United States|url=https://www.americanheraldry.org/heraldry-in-the-usa/roll-of-early-american-arms/w|publisher=American Heraldry Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Massachusetts Bay Colony==\n\n===Arrival===\nOn 8 April 1630, four ships left the [[Isle of Wight]] carrying Winthrop and other leaders of the colony.

In it, he used the now-famous phrase \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently \"the eyes of all people are upon us.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 175\u2013179</ref> He also said, \"In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection\"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient\u2014and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\">{{cite web|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29778?docPos=2|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:WinthropLanding.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving showing Winthrop's arrival at Salem]]\nThe fleet arrived at [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June and was welcomed by John Endecott.  Winthrop and his deputy [[Thomas Dudley]] found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area.  They first decided to base the colony at [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]] where they founded what is now the city of [[Boston]].<ref>Mayo (1936), pp. 54\u201358</ref>  The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the [[Charles River]] in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack. These settlements became Boston, Cambridge, Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, Medford, and Charlestown.\n\nThe colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop's son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/><ref name=\"B103\"/>  Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony.  According to one report, he \"fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 104</ref>\n\nWinthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 205</ref>  In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the [[Mystic River]] that he called [[Ten Hills, Somerville, Massachusetts|Ten Hills Farm]].<ref>Manegold, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony's first boats was built, Winthrop's ''[[Blessing of the Bay]]''.  Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.<ref>Hart, p. 1:184</ref>\n\nThe issue of where to locate the colony's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley.  Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there.  However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there.  This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 213</ref>  However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married.  Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], going to stake their claims.  At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers \"in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage\".<ref>Morison, p. 91</ref>  Dudley's lands became [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], and Winthrop's [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].<ref>Jones, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Colonial governance===\n[[Image:JohnWinthrop 1873 OurYoungFolks.png|thumb|right|upright|Engraving depicting Winthrop being carried across the [[Mystic River]]]]\nThe colony's charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a [[Governor's Council]]. All these officers were to be elected annually by the [[freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] of the colony.<ref>Morison, p. 84</ref>  The first meeting of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] consisted of exactly eight men.  They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times.  The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members.<ref>Morison, p. 85</ref>  The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Morison, p. 82</ref>\n[[File:John Winthrop Home Site Charlestown.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the \"Great House\" near the corner of New Rutherford Avenue and Chelsea Avenue, Charlestown, Massachusetts.  This was the home of John Winthrop and also served as the first seat of government in the colony.]]\n\nWhen the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants.  Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen.  A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 218</ref>  In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with [[Roger Ludlow]] as deputy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 243</ref>  Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 241</ref>\n\nIn the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates.  Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them.<ref name=B305/>  His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the [[common law]] tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances.  He also pointed out that adoption of written laws \"repugnant to the laws of England\" was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law.<ref name=B306>Bremer (2003), p. 306</ref>  The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was formally adopted during [[Richard Bellingham]]'s governorship in 1641.<ref name=B305>Bremer (2003), p. 305</ref>  Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.<ref>Osgood, p. 3:334</ref>\n\nIn the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because \"a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.\"<ref name=Mor92>Morison, p. 92</ref>\n\nWinthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] militia.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 361</ref>  The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants.  Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions.  Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant.  He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 362</ref>  Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 363</ref>\n\nOne major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that \"civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English\", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition.<ref>Hart, pp. 1:122\u2013123</ref>  William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.<ref>Moore, p. 263</ref>\n\n===Religious controversies===\n{{further |Calvinism}}\n[[Image:Anne Hutchinson on Trial.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[Anne Hutchinson]]'s trial, c. 1901]]\nIn 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of settlers brought first [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and then [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] to the governorship.  Haynes, Vane, [[Anne Hutchinson]], and pastors [[Thomas Hooker]] and [[John Wheelwright]] all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 281\u2013285</ref> Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the [[Antinomianism|Antinomian]] view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more [[Legalism (theology)|Legalist]] view. This religious rift is commonly called the [[Antinomian Controversy]], and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 285</ref>  By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.) In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 291</ref>\n\nDudley's election did not immediately quell the controversy.  First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony.<ref name=B293/>  (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]; Wheelwright founded first [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] and then [[Wells, Maine]] in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.)<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 299</ref><ref>Golson, pp. 61\u201362</ref> Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should \"make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves.\"<ref name=B293>Bremer (2003), p. 293</ref> Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the [[Connecticut River]] (the nucleus of the [[Connecticut Colony]]);<ref>Moore, pp. 300\u2013302</ref> Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government.<ref>Winship, p. 9</ref> (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the [[English Civil War]]s; he was beheaded after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].)<ref>Moore, pp. 321\u2013333</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates. Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to \"refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours\".<ref name=B294>Bremer (2003), p. 294</ref> Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635.<ref name=B294/> Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams' arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of [[Providence Plantations]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 251</ref><ref>Providence Plantation later united with the settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) to create the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].</ref> Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 252</ref>\n\n===Indian policy===\nWinthrop's attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy.  He described an early meeting with one local chief:\n\n<blockquote>[[Chickatabot]] came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and [[pea]]se, and a mug, and other small things.<ref>Moore, pp. 246\u2013247</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years,<ref>Moseley, p. 52</ref> although they also practiced a policy that historian [[Alfred A. Cave|Alfred Cave]] calls ''[[vacuum domicilium]]'': if land is not under some sort of active use, it is free for the taking.  This meant that lands could be claimed which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise.  According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop claimed that the rights of \"more advanced\" peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.<ref>Cave, pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\nHowever, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the [[Pequot War]] was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged.  Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on [[Block Island]] in the war's first major action.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 267</ref> Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansetts]] to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 269</ref>  The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the [[West Indies]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 271</ref>\n\n===Slavery and the slave trade===\nSlavery already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop's arrival, since [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] arrived in the area with slaves in 1624.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  In the aftermath of the Pequot War, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves.  Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), p. 314</ref>\n\nIn 1641, the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things.  Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived.  C. S. Manegold writes that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), pp. 304, 305, 314</ref>\n\n===Trade and diplomacy===\nRising tensions in England culminated in [[English Civil War|civil war]] and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies.  The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on [[Barbados]], a source of [[cotton]], and with the neighboring French colony of [[Acadia]].<ref>Moseley, p. 99</ref>\n\nFrench Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. It was embroiled in [[Acadian Civil War|a minor civil war]] between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with [[Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour]] in 1642, and his opponent [[Charles de Menou d'Aulnay]] warned Boston traders away from la Tour's territories.  In June 1643, la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d'Aulnay.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 343</ref>  Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.<ref name=B344>Bremer (2003), p. 344</ref>\n\nThis decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 345</ref>  John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses.<ref name=B344/>  The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 346</ref>  The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor.  In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers.  Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a [[sedan chair]], originally given to him by an English privateer.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 347</ref>\n\n===Property and family===\n[[Image:FortWinthrop.png|thumb|right|The 19th century [[Fort Winthrop]], constructed on [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] and formerly owned by Winthrop]]\nIn addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner.  He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] in Boston Harbor (now the site of [[Logan International Airport]]), and [[Prudence Island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]].<ref>Moore, pp. 264\u2013265</ref>  He also engaged in the [[fur trade]] in partnership with [[William Pynchon]], using the ship ''Blessing of the Bay''.<ref name=B252_3>Bremer (2003), pp. 252\u2013253</ref>  Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of [[Fort Winthrop]].<ref>Stanhope and Bacon, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nThe farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop's part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop.  The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties.  Private subscriptions to support him raised about \u00a3500 and the colony also granted his wife {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>Moore, p. 264</ref>\n\nHis wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the ''Lyon'' in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647.<ref>Anderson, p. 2039</ref><ref>Bremer (2003), p. 187</ref> Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of [[Thomas Rainsborough|Thomas]] and [[William Rainborowe]].<ref>Anderson, p. 2040</ref>  Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649, and is buried in what is now called the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]] in Boston.<ref>Moore, p. 265</ref>  He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.<ref>Moore, pp. 271\u2013272</ref>\n\n==Writings and legacy==\nWinthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations.  His major contributions to the literary world were ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' (1630) and ''The History of New England'' (1630\u20131649, also known as ''The Journal of John Winthrop''), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.\n\n===''A Model of Christian Charity''===\n{{main|Model of Christian Charity}}\nJohn Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that became ''A Model of Christian Charity'' either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route.<ref name=B174/>  It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World.  He used the phrase \"city upon a hill\" (derived from the [[Bible]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]])<ref>Matthew 5:13: \"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\"</ref> to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community.<ref>Findling and Thackeray, p. 61</ref>  He encouraged the colonists to \"bear one another's burdens\" and to view themselves as a \"Company of Christ, bound together by Love.\"<ref name=Dunn11>Dunn, p. 11</ref>  He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.  If they did so, God would \"make us a prayse and glory, that man shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England.\"<ref name=Dunn11/>\n\nWinthrop's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of [[American exceptionalism]].<ref>See e.g. Pease, p. 76 and Hodgson, p. 1</ref>  Recent research has shown, however, that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery, unlike the farewell sermon of [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].<ref name=B174>Bremer (2003), p. 174</ref>  Furthermore, Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts, but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs.  The work was not published until the nineteenth century, although it was known and circulated in manuscript before that time.<ref name=JW151>Jehlen and Warner, p. 151</ref>\n\n===''The History of New England''===\nWinthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the \"central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s\".<ref name=Winthropxi>Winthrop et al, p. xi</ref>  The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by [[Noah Webster]].  The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by [[James Savage (banker)|James Savage]] as ''The History of New England from 1630\u20131649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts''.  The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage's office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xii</ref>  Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage's transcription of the second notebook.<ref>Winthrop et al</ref>\n\nThe journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing.  As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xvi</ref>  Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGroups=&sortBy=&source=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=GALE%7CDPZJVZ793683095&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1631007034|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life.  Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xxvii</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nWinthrop's earliest publication was likely ''The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects'' (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by [[Joshua Scottow]] in the 1696 compilation ''MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England,  The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/scottow/7/|title=Massachusetts: or The First Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of Their Coming Thither, and Abode There: In Several Epistles (1696)|accessdate=2011-01-21|publisher=University of Nebraska, Lincoln}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief \"in the validity of experience\" in a private religious journal known as his ''Experiencia''.<ref name=Bremer1984>Bremer (1984)</ref>  He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the ''Journal''.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xviii</ref>  Later in his life, he wrote ''A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England'' which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644.<ref>Schweninger, pp. 47\u201366</ref> At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] had recently begun to meet.  The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book's worth, and by opponents as proving its failings.<ref>Hall, p. 200</ref>  In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] political leader in the discussion. Vane's opponents sought to \"tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea.\"<ref>Moseley, p. 125</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop's writings echoed those of other Puritans which \"were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play.\"<ref name=Bremer1984/>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Image:John Winthrop Tomb Boston.jpg|thumb|right|Winthrop's tomb in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]]]\nWinthrop's reference to the \"city upon a hill\" in ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse.<ref name=Bxv/>  Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times.  Winthrop's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], and leading to modern assessments of him as a \"lost Founding Father\". Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop \"is at once a significant founding father of America's best and worst impulses\", with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.<ref>Holland, p. 2</ref>\n\nWinthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, \"evil as well as good,\" a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was \"the proper end and object of authority\", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGro|website=Biography in context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Charles|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00995.html?a=1&n=john%20winthrop&d=10&ss=1&q=5|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany modern politicians refer to Winthrop's writings in their speeches, people as diverse as [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Michael Dukakis]], and [[Sarah Palin]].<ref name=Bxv>Bremer (2003), p. xv</ref><ref>Kennedy, p. 48</ref>  Ronald Reagan described Winthrop as \"an early 'Freedom Man'\" who came to America \"looking for a home that would be free.\"<ref name=Mos7>Moseley, p. 7</ref>\n\nWinthrop is a major character in [[Catharine Maria Sedgwick]]'s 1827 novel ''[[Hope Leslie]]'', set in colonial Massachusetts.<ref>Sedgwick</ref> He also makes a brief appearance in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' in the chapter entitled \"The Minister's Vigil.\"<ref>Hawthorne</ref>\n\nWinthrop's descendants number thousands today.  His son John was the first governor of the [[Saybrook Colony]], and later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century.  Twentieth century descendants include former US Senator from Massachusetts and former Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], and educator [[Charles William Eliot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/governor-thomas-dudley/|title=Notable Descendants of Governor Thomas Dudley|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=2011-01-25|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd}}</ref>  The towns of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], and [[Winthrop, Maine]], are named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_About/about |title=About Winthrop, Massachusetts |publisher=Town of Winthrop |accessdate=2011-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224152640/http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_About/about |archivedate=24 December 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>Howard and Crocker, p. 2:72</ref> [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and Winthrop Hall at [[Bowdoin College]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/images/lunagallery/winthropluna.shtml|title=Winthrop Hall \u2013 Library \u2013 Bowdoin College|accessdate=2014-01-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113184155/http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/images/lunagallery/winthropluna.shtml|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are named in honor of him and of his descendant [[John Winthrop (educator)|John Winthrop]], who briefly served as [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winthrophouse.net/node/25|title=History of Winthrop House|publisher=Winthrop House|accessdate=2011-02-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124211331/http://www.winthrophouse.net/node/25|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe is also the namesake of squares in Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[Winthrop Building]] on Water Street in Boston was built on the site of one of his homes and is one of the city's first skyscrapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BOS.2111|title=Massachusetts Cultural Resource Inventory: Winthrop Building|accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>\n\nA [[John Winthrop (Greenough)|statue of Winthrop]] by [[Richard Saltonstall Greenough|Richard Greenough]] is one of Massachusetts' two statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington D.C.]].<ref>Murdock, Myrtle Chaney, National Statuary Hall in the Nation's Capitol, Monumental Press, Inc., Washington, D.C., 1955 pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unref|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1=1.

Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan \"[[city upon a hill]]\" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies.\n\nWinthrop was born into a wealthy land-owning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became [[Lord of the Manor]] at [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]] in [[Suffolk]].  He was not involved in founding the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] began a crackdown on [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] religious thought. In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the [[New World]] in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the [[Charles River]].\n\nBetween 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative [[Thomas Dudley]] and the more liberal [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]]. Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it \"the meanest and worst of all forms of government\".<ref name=Mor92/> The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.\n\nWinthrop's son [[John Winthrop the Younger|John]] was one of the founders of the [[Connecticut Colony]], and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period. His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.\n\n==Life in England==\nJohn Winthrop was born on January 12, 1587/8<ref name=dates>In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on March 25.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years.

Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 107</ref> The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnWinthropJr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Winthrop's eldest son [[John Winthrop the Younger]]]]\nWinthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings.<ref name=B91/><ref>Morison, p. 59</ref> In it, he described his failures to keep \"divers vows\" and sought to reform his failings by God's grace, praying that God would \"give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me\".<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 96</ref> He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that \"she proved after a right godly woman.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 97</ref> He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.<ref>Morison, p. 60</ref>\n\nHis wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time by marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on December 6, 1615. She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was \"truly religious & industrious therein\".<ref name=B103/> Thomasine died on December 8, 1616 from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.<ref name=B103>Bremer (2003), p. 103</ref>\n\nIn approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at [[Gray's Inn]].  There he read the law but did not advance to the Bar.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 101</ref> His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of [[Great Maplestead]], [[Essex]], and he began courting [[Margaret Tyndal Winthrop|Margaret Tyndal]] in 1617, the daughter of [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] judge Sir John Tyndal and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of Puritan preacher [[Stephen Egerton (clergyman)|Stephen Egerton]]. Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds;<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 112\u2013113</ref> Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue which more than compensated for his modest income. The couple were married on April 29, 1618 at [[Great Maplestead]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 115</ref> They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]]. His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 117\u2013125</ref>\n\n===Decision to emigrate===\nIn the mid- to late-1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the [[English Reformation]] was in danger. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic. Charles was opposed to all manner of [[recusant]]s and supported the [[Church of England]] in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices.<ref name=M64/> This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the [[New World]] as a viable means to escape persecution.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 138</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnEndecottPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Endecott]] preceded Winthrop as governor in Massachusetts]]\nThe first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the [[Plymouth Colony]] on the shores of [[Cape Cod Bay]].<ref>Morison, p. 12</ref> Pastor [[John White (colonist priest)|John White]] led a short-lived effort to establish a colony at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624, also on the Massachusetts coast.<ref>Morison, pp. 28\u201329</ref> In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the [[Charles River|Charles]] and [[Merrimack River]]s. It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory.<ref>Morison, pp. 31\u201334</ref>  Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by [[John Endecott]] to prepare the way for further migration.<ref>Morison, p. 35</ref> John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which primarily involved individuals from [[Lincolnshire]]; however, he was probably aware of the company's activities and plans by early 1629. The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company because there were many indirect connections between him and individuals associated with the company.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 153\u2013155</ref> Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son [[Henry Winthrop|Henry]] became involved in efforts to settle [[Barbados]] in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.<ref>Manegold, pp. 8\u201312</ref>\n\nIn March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning [[Personal Rule|eleven years of rule]] without Parliament.<ref name=M64>Morison, p. 64</ref> This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor [[Matthew Cradock]] proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 156</ref> It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. He wrote, \"If the Lord seeth it wilbe<!--sic--> good for us, he will provide a shelter & a hidinge place for us and others\".<ref name=M64/> During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration, and he circulated a paper on August 12 providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 157\u2013158</ref> His name appears in formal connection with the company on the [[Cambridge Agreement]] signed August 26; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.<ref>Morison, p. 69</ref>\n\nThe company shareholders met on October 20 to enact the changes agreed to in August. Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen. Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election. The other two were [[Richard Saltonstall]] and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 161</ref> Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration.<ref>Moore, p. 277</ref> Winthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration. He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony's spiritual needs.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 164</ref>\n\nIt was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet's departure time. They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time, and it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 162, 203</ref> To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 169</ref> Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John, Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 162</ref> By April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order, although Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute. The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John, Jr. left for the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 168</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:The Coat of Arms of John Winthrop (1587-1649).gif|thumb|The coat of arms of John Winthrop]]\n\nJohn Winthrop used a [[coat of arms]] that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the [[College of Arms]], London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]. It is also the coat of arms for [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son [[Deane Winthrop]] at the [[Deane Winthrop House]]. The heraldic [[blazon]] of arms is ''Argent three chevronels Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Arms of the Founders and Leaders of European Settlements in the Present-Day United States|url=https://www.americanheraldry.org/heraldry-in-the-usa/roll-of-early-american-arms/w|publisher=American Heraldry Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Massachusetts Bay Colony==\n\n===Arrival===\nOn 8 April 1630, four ships left the [[Isle of Wight]] carrying Winthrop and other leaders of the colony.

In it, he used the now-famous phrase \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently \"the eyes of all people are upon us.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 175\u2013179</ref> He also said, \"In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection\"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient\u2014and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\">{{cite web|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29778?docPos=2|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:WinthropLanding.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving showing Winthrop's arrival at Salem]]\nThe fleet arrived at [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June and was welcomed by John Endecott.  Winthrop and his deputy [[Thomas Dudley]] found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area.  They first decided to base the colony at [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]] where they founded what is now the city of [[Boston]].<ref>Mayo (1936), pp. 54\u201358</ref>  The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the [[Charles River]] in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack. These settlements became Boston, Cambridge, Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, Medford, and Charlestown.\n\nThe colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop's son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/><ref name=\"B103\"/>  Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony.  According to one report, he \"fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 104</ref>\n\nWinthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 205</ref>  In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the [[Mystic River]] that he called [[Ten Hills, Somerville, Massachusetts|Ten Hills Farm]].<ref>Manegold, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony's first boats was built, Winthrop's ''[[Blessing of the Bay]]''.  Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.<ref>Hart, p. 1:184</ref>\n\nThe issue of where to locate the colony's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley.  Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there.  However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there.  This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 213</ref>  However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married.  Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], going to stake their claims.  At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers \"in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage\".<ref>Morison, p. 91</ref>  Dudley's lands became [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], and Winthrop's [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].<ref>Jones, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Colonial governance===\n[[Image:JohnWinthrop 1873 OurYoungFolks.png|thumb|right|upright|Engraving depicting Winthrop being carried across the [[Mystic River]]]]\nThe colony's charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a [[Governor's Council]]. All these officers were to be elected annually by the [[freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] of the colony.<ref>Morison, p. 84</ref>  The first meeting of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] consisted of exactly eight men.  They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times.  The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members.<ref>Morison, p. 85</ref>  The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Morison, p. 82</ref>\n[[File:John Winthrop Home Site Charlestown.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the \"Great House\" near the corner of New Rutherford Avenue and Chelsea Avenue, Charlestown, Massachusetts.  This was the home of John Winthrop and also served as the first seat of government in the colony.]]\n\nWhen the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants.  Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen.  A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 218</ref>  In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with [[Roger Ludlow]] as deputy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 243</ref>  Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 241</ref>\n\nIn the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates.  Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them.<ref name=B305/>  His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the [[common law]] tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances.  He also pointed out that adoption of written laws \"repugnant to the laws of England\" was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law.<ref name=B306>Bremer (2003), p. 306</ref>  The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was formally adopted during [[Richard Bellingham]]'s governorship in 1641.<ref name=B305>Bremer (2003), p. 305</ref>  Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.<ref>Osgood, p. 3:334</ref>\n\nIn the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because \"a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.\"<ref name=Mor92>Morison, p. 92</ref>\n\nWinthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] militia.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 361</ref>  The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants.  Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions.  Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant.  He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 362</ref>  Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 363</ref>\n\nOne major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that \"civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English\", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition.<ref>Hart, pp. 1:122\u2013123</ref>  William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.<ref>Moore, p. 263</ref>\n\n===Religious controversies===\n{{further |Calvinism}}\n[[Image:Anne Hutchinson on Trial.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[Anne Hutchinson]]'s trial, c. 1901]]\nIn 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of settlers brought first [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and then [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] to the governorship.  Haynes, Vane, [[Anne Hutchinson]], and pastors [[Thomas Hooker]] and [[John Wheelwright]] all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 281\u2013285</ref> Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the [[Antinomianism|Antinomian]] view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more [[Legalism (theology)|Legalist]] view. This religious rift is commonly called the [[Antinomian Controversy]], and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 285</ref>  By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.) In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 291</ref>\n\nDudley's election did not immediately quell the controversy.  First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony.<ref name=B293/>  (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]; Wheelwright founded first [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] and then [[Wells, Maine]] in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.)<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 299</ref><ref>Golson, pp. 61\u201362</ref> Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should \"make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves.\"<ref name=B293>Bremer (2003), p. 293</ref> Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the [[Connecticut River]] (the nucleus of the [[Connecticut Colony]]);<ref>Moore, pp. 300\u2013302</ref> Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government.<ref>Winship, p. 9</ref> (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the [[English Civil War]]s; he was beheaded after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].)<ref>Moore, pp. 321\u2013333</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates. Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to \"refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours\".<ref name=B294>Bremer (2003), p. 294</ref> Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635.<ref name=B294/> Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams' arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of [[Providence Plantations]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 251</ref><ref>Providence Plantation later united with the settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) to create the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].</ref> Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 252</ref>\n\n===Indian policy===\nWinthrop's attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy.  He described an early meeting with one local chief:\n\n<blockquote>[[Chickatabot]] came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and [[pea]]se, and a mug, and other small things.<ref>Moore, pp. 246\u2013247</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years,<ref>Moseley, p. 52</ref> although they also practiced a policy that historian [[Alfred A. Cave|Alfred Cave]] calls ''[[vacuum domicilium]]'': if land is not under some sort of active use, it is free for the taking.  This meant that lands could be claimed which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise.  According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop claimed that the rights of \"more advanced\" peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.<ref>Cave, pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\nHowever, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the [[Pequot War]] was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged.  Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on [[Block Island]] in the war's first major action.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 267</ref> Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansetts]] to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 269</ref>  The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the [[West Indies]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 271</ref>\n\n===Slavery and the slave trade===\nSlavery already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop's arrival, since [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] arrived in the area with slaves in 1624.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  In the aftermath of the Pequot War, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves.  Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), p. 314</ref>\n\nIn 1641, the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things.  Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived.  C. S. Manegold writes that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), pp. 304, 305, 314</ref>\n\n===Trade and diplomacy===\nRising tensions in England culminated in [[English Civil War|civil war]] and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies.  The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on [[Barbados]], a source of [[cotton]], and with the neighboring French colony of [[Acadia]].<ref>Moseley, p. 99</ref>\n\nFrench Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. It was embroiled in [[Acadian Civil War|a minor civil war]] between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with [[Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour]] in 1642, and his opponent [[Charles de Menou d'Aulnay]] warned Boston traders away from la Tour's territories.  In June 1643, la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d'Aulnay.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 343</ref>  Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.<ref name=B344>Bremer (2003), p. 344</ref>\n\nThis decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 345</ref>  John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses.<ref name=B344/>  The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 346</ref>  The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor.  In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers.  Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a [[sedan chair]], originally given to him by an English privateer.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 347</ref>\n\n===Property and family===\n[[Image:FortWinthrop.png|thumb|right|The 19th century [[Fort Winthrop]], constructed on [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] and formerly owned by Winthrop]]\nIn addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner.  He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] in Boston Harbor (now the site of [[Logan International Airport]]), and [[Prudence Island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]].<ref>Moore, pp. 264\u2013265</ref>  He also engaged in the [[fur trade]] in partnership with [[William Pynchon]], using the ship ''Blessing of the Bay''.<ref name=B252_3>Bremer (2003), pp. 252\u2013253</ref>  Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of [[Fort Winthrop]].<ref>Stanhope and Bacon, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nThe farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop's part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop.  The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties.  Private subscriptions to support him raised about \u00a3500 and the colony also granted his wife {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>Moore, p. 264</ref>\n\nHis wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the ''Lyon'' in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647.<ref>Anderson, p. 2039</ref><ref>Bremer (2003), p. 187</ref> Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of [[Thomas Rainsborough|Thomas]] and [[William Rainborowe]].<ref>Anderson, p. 2040</ref>  Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649, and is buried in what is now called the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]] in Boston.<ref>Moore, p. 265</ref>  He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.<ref>Moore, pp. 271\u2013272</ref>\n\n==Writings and legacy==\nWinthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations.  His major contributions to the literary world were ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' (1630) and ''The History of New England'' (1630\u20131649, also known as ''The Journal of John Winthrop''), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.\n\n===''A Model of Christian Charity''===\n{{main|Model of Christian Charity}}\nJohn Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that became ''A Model of Christian Charity'' either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route.<ref name=B174/>  It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World.  He used the phrase \"city upon a hill\" (derived from the [[Bible]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]])<ref>Matthew 5:13: \"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\"</ref> to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community.<ref>Findling and Thackeray, p. 61</ref>  He encouraged the colonists to \"bear one another's burdens\" and to view themselves as a \"Company of Christ, bound together by Love.\"<ref name=Dunn11>Dunn, p. 11</ref>  He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.  If they did so, God would \"make us a prayse and glory, that man shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England.\"<ref name=Dunn11/>\n\nWinthrop's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of [[American exceptionalism]].<ref>See e.g. Pease, p. 76 and Hodgson, p. 1</ref>  Recent research has shown, however, that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery, unlike the farewell sermon of [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].<ref name=B174>Bremer (2003), p. 174</ref>  Furthermore, Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts, but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs.  The work was not published until the nineteenth century, although it was known and circulated in manuscript before that time.<ref name=JW151>Jehlen and Warner, p. 151</ref>\n\n===''The History of New England''===\nWinthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the \"central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s\".<ref name=Winthropxi>Winthrop et al, p. xi</ref>  The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by [[Noah Webster]].  The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by [[James Savage (banker)|James Savage]] as ''The History of New England from 1630\u20131649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts''.  The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage's office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xii</ref>  Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage's transcription of the second notebook.<ref>Winthrop et al</ref>\n\nThe journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing.  As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xvi</ref>  Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGroups=&sortBy=&source=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=GALE%7CDPZJVZ793683095&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1631007034|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life.  Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xxvii</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nWinthrop's earliest publication was likely ''The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects'' (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by [[Joshua Scottow]] in the 1696 compilation ''MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England,  The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/scottow/7/|title=Massachusetts: or The First Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of Their Coming Thither, and Abode There: In Several Epistles (1696)|accessdate=2011-01-21|publisher=University of Nebraska, Lincoln}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief \"in the validity of experience\" in a private religious journal known as his ''Experiencia''.<ref name=Bremer1984>Bremer (1984)</ref>  He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the ''Journal''.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xviii</ref>  Later in his life, he wrote ''A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England'' which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644.<ref>Schweninger, pp. 47\u201366</ref> At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] had recently begun to meet.  The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book's worth, and by opponents as proving its failings.<ref>Hall, p. 200</ref>  In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] political leader in the discussion. Vane's opponents sought to \"tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea.\"<ref>Moseley, p. 125</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop's writings echoed those of other Puritans which \"were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play.\"<ref name=Bremer1984/>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Image:John Winthrop Tomb Boston.jpg|thumb|right|Winthrop's tomb in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]]]\nWinthrop's reference to the \"city upon a hill\" in ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse.<ref name=Bxv/>  Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times.  Winthrop's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], and leading to modern assessments of him as a \"lost Founding Father\". Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop \"is at once a significant founding father of America's best and worst impulses\", with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.<ref>Holland, p. 2</ref>\n\nWinthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, \"evil as well as good,\" a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was \"the proper end and object of authority\", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGro|website=Biography in context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Charles|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00995.html?a=1&n=john%20winthrop&d=10&ss=1&q=5|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany modern politicians refer to Winthrop's writings in their speeches, people as diverse as [[John F.

His son John was the first governor of the [[Saybrook Colony]], and later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century.

These [[carbon brush|brushless]] motors rotate at up to 110,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111085313/http://www.dyson.com/technology/ddmtabbed.asp |date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref> The motor used a two-pole brushless rotor with a digital controller. Dyson said its efficiency was 84%, which was less than the [[Electric motor#Brushless DC motor|96% efficiency]] that is achieved in some brushless designs. In order to deal with the high speed and [[centrifugal force]]s, the impeller is made of [[carbon fibre reinforced polymer]]; the shaft is steel. \n\nThe first mass-produced version was named \"X020\" and used in the Airblade hand dryer; the later DDM \"V2\" was used for Dyson handheld vacuum cleaners.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411205153/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |date=April 11, 2012 }}</ref> Dyson has continued to develop its proprietary motor designs for various products, improving efficiency for increased battery life, and reducing acoustic noise, resulting in a \"V8\" version (for cordless vacuums) and a \"V9\" version (for a hair dryer), {{asof|2020||lc=y}}.\n\n=== Root Cyclone technology ===\nThe [[Dyson (company)#Cyclonic separation technology|Dyson Root Cyclone]] technology is used in all Dyson vacuum cleaners from DC07 onward. The DC17, DC22, and DC23 use the improved \"Root Cyclone & Core Separator\", also called \"Radix Cyclone\", \"Intermediary Cyclone\", or \"Level 3 Root Cyclone Technology\".\n\nMost of the current range use \"2 Tier Radial cyclones\", consisting of two cascaded levels of [[cyclonic separator]]s to remove dirt and dust without requiring a bag or filter.\n\n== Vacuum cleaners ==\n\n=== Model versions ===\nAll versions are identified by a name such as \"DC14\". Some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities, implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied. Suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model.\n* All Floors, Multi Floor, Wood+Wool: suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets.\n* Allergy: suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens.\n* Animal: so as to pick up animal hairs better than a general-purpose model, and filter out fine particles. These machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair, human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery, cars, and confined areas.\n* Motorhead: cylinder or handheld model with direct-drive motorised brush head.\n* Full Gear: same features as \"Animal\" with more attachments.\n\n==== Special Edition models ====\nOther suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores, e.g. \"Comet Exclusive\" and \"Overdrive\" (Comet) or \"Blitz it\" (Currys).\n\nSome are limited editions:\n\n===== \"Drawing\" limited editions =====\nThese machines feature a different range of tools to the usual \"Multifloor\" and \"Animal\" versions and also appear in different colours. The Drawing later became exclusive to the British [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis Department Store]]s.\n\n===== \"De Stijl\" limited editions =====\nSome of the early Dyson models (DC01, DC02, DC04) were available in a special limited edition \"[[De Stijl]]\" colour scheme, in homage to the Dutch design movement of the same name. All these are coloured a combination of purple, red and yellow.\n\n===== \"Dyson Antarctic Solo\" limited editions =====\nIn 1996, 100,000 recolored DC01 and DC02 models were produced as part of a fund-raising effort for [[Ranulph Fiennes|Ranulph Fiennes's]] solo expedition to the Antarctic. For these models, the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones, and on the DC02 Antarctic Solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver.<ref>Dyson, J.

The vacuum features an updated root cyclone and a redesigned brush roll with more power than the DC41 and a better edge cleaning system. Some variants (like the Animal model) include the Tangle-Free Turbine Tool. Dyson has undergone a name change to their models, and this appears to be the same base design as the new UP13 model marketed as the \"Dyson Ball Allergy\".

Some versions of the V6, such as the Animal Extra and the Total Clean come with a 35W main powerhead with 75% more brushbar power than the standard head. The V6 develops 28 Airwatts of suction in its extended runtime mode, and 100 Airwatts of suction in its MAX mode, but runtime on a full charge in MAX mode is limited to 6 minutes. Runtime on a full charge using extended run time mode is 20 minutes with the non motorised tools attached, and 15 \u2013 17 minutes with the motorised heads attached. The V6 has been an immensely successful machine for Dyson, but did have issues such as a short runtime, a small dust cup capacity and less than easy dust cup removal, which were all addressed with the next generation of cordless models, the V8 and V7 ranges, which are due to replace the V6.\n|-\n|V8\n|2016\n|The Dyson V8 is an upgraded version of the V6 with better battery life (up to 40 mins without the brush heads),<ref name=\"homecleanexpert.com\">{{cite web|url=https://homecleanexpert.com/best-cordless-vacuum-for-hardwood-floors/#dysonV8|title=Cordless Vacuum Reviews|website=Home Clean Expert|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> a larger dust cup capacity, modifications to the debris emptying process (Called the \"Hygienic dirt ejection system\"), and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor HEPA filter. The V8 produces 22 Air watts of suction on normal (extended runtime) power (28 on the V6) and 115 airwatts in MAX mode (100 on the V6). Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors, which are a 50W main motorised powerhead with nylon and carbon fibre filaments for carpet use and hard floor dusting, a 20W \"Fluffy\" soft roller head for hard floor cleaning, and a 20W mini motorised head, with nylon bristles. Runtimes of the V8 in extended run time mode are 40 minutes with non motorised tools attached, 30 minutes with the fluffy head or mini motorised head attached, and 25 minutes with the main 50W powerhead attached. In MAX mode, the run times are approximately 7 minutes regardless of what tools are fitted. The V8 has full HEPA filtration provided by a removable and washable HEPA exhaust filter located on the back of the motor housing. The HEPA filter system was carried over from the V6 Absolute. The V8 also has a washable pre-motor filter so theoretically no filter replacements should be necessary during the life of the machine. The battery on the V8 is replaceable if necessary.\n|-\n|V7\n|2017\n|Based off the design and overall look of the Dyson V8, the V7, which was launched in 2017, uses a similar digital motor and accessories. However, being a less expensive model to purchase, it has some differences to the higher priced V8. The battery can only run the V7 for up to 30 minutes on a full charge, whereas the V8 can run for up to 40 minutes. The V7 is equipped with a 35W main motorised powerhead, compared to one with 50W on the V8, and also some models of V7 come with a 20W mini electric turbo tool of a slightly differing design to that of the V8. As it has a physically smaller battery than the V8, the V7 weighs less than the V8. In terms of performance, the V7 produces 21 Airwatts of suction on \"extended run time\" mode, compared to 22 on the V8 and 28 on the V6, and it produces 100 Airwatts (as on the V6) on Max mode, compared to 115 airwatts on the V8. Most models of V7 do not come equipped with a HEPA removable exhaust filter. Like the V8, the V7 incorporates the hygienic dirt ejection system, and the quick release \"red button\" tools system, and it also has the same, larger dust cup capacity of the V8. It also, like the V8, runs for up to 7 minutes, when put in Max mode.\n|-\n|V8 Carbon Fiber\n|\n|2017\n|The Dyson V8 Carbon Fiber is an upgrade version of V8 with a much more powerful motor. The V8 Carbon Fiber produces 155 AW (115 AW on the original V8) in MAX mode. The battery can also run 40 minutes (same as original V8) in the normal mode.\n|-\n|V10\n|\n|2018\n|The Dyson V10, launched in March 2018, is an upgrade version of previous V8 with a much more powerful motor (V8: 108,000 rpm / V10: 125,000 rpm). It has a much larger bin capacity, \"point and shoot\" hygienic bin emptying system, and a single \"all in one\" washable filter consisting of both the pre-motor and post motor filter. It has 3 motor speeds compared to 2 for the V6, V7 and V8.\n\nThere are two distinct models of the V10 with differing motors, filter assemblies and bin sizes. The V10 with larger bin gives 15.8 airwatts on low speed, the medium speed gives 33 airwatts, and the maximum speed gives 151 airwatts of suction. Run times are extended up to 60 minutes for speed setting 1 (15.8 Airwatts) with no motorised floorhead attached. The machine will run for 5 minutes in MAX speed (151 Airwatts) setting, 20 minutes in the second speed  (33 Airwatts) setting with the motorised large powerhead, and 30 minutes in the lowest speed (15.8 Airwatts) setting, with the motorised large powerhead fitted. A smaller version of the V10 with a V8 sized bin was released with a different motor with a maximum airwattage of 130 and smaller combined filter assembly. Like the V8, it has a wall mounting unit which it can be charged in, and charge time from empty is 3.5 hours. It comes with the same type of large motorised  powerheads as the V8, consisting of the direct drive motorhead, and the \"fluffy\" hard floor motorised head.

The Torque Drive, Absolute, and Outsize models have Lcd screens that show the battery level. The operation time limits stay the same as of the former V10. The V11s run from $650-$1,300. The V11 Outsize is the strongest version, it has about the same bin size of their uprights. The V11 Outsize also has 2 click-in removable batteries that total up to 120 minutes of run time on eco mode with a non-motorized tool.\n\n|}\n\n==== Other ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model name\n!Image\n!Launch year\n!Description\n|-\n|360 Eye\n|[[File:Dyson 360 Eye (2017-07-29).jpg|frameless|194.983x194.983px]]\n|2014\n|The Dyson 360 Eye, a floor cleaning robot, uses a 360\u00b0 panoramic vision sensor and IR distance sensors to map a room and navigate, enabling it to perform a systematic cleaning pattern that covers the accessible floor area only once.

It was the first to use \"Dual Cyclone\" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.\n|-\n|DC01\n|''no image''\n|1993\n|The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, May 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented \"Dual Cyclone\" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.\nThe DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of \"brush control\" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration \u2013 standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The [[suction power]] of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.\n|-\n|DC03\n|''no image''\n|1997\n|The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9&nbsp;kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of [[HEPA]] filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball\n|-\n|DC04\n|''no image''\n|1998\n|The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushroll bar introduced on the DC03.\n|-\n|DC07\n|[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|frameless|261x261px]]\n|2001\n|The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a  cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.\nThe DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9&nbsp;kg.\nThe DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations. During the DC07 production run, in 2002, Dyson switched all manufacturing of its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new factory in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC14\n|''no image''\n|2004\n|The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. {{As of|2012|1}} listed as \"End of Line\" on Dyson Web site.\n|-\n|DC15\n|[[File:Dyson DC15.jpg|frameless|159x159px]]\n|2005\n|The DC15, known as ''The Ball'' was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal, and is loosely based on the DC14. It was the first vacuum to use a ball instead of existing static wheels, so as to make it more possible to steer and maneuver the cleaner around obstacles and corners, in conjunction with a [[universal joint]] mechanism on the cleaner head, by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the \"Ball\" system originated from the [[Ballbarrow]], James Dyson's first invention.\nThe DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the \"ball\".\n\nDue to its high launch price, its weight ({{Convert|8.6|kg|lb}}), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.\n|-\n|DC17\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allbrands.com/images/products_spec/L_17932_DC17animal.jpg|title=Level 3 Root Cyclone}}</ref> This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.\nThe second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with [[Europe]]an carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for [[North America]] with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.\n\nThe third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and [[titanium]] as the main colour for the entire machine.<ref>[http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17 Official DC17 page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201104533/http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17|date=February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n|-\n|DC18\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The {{Convert|6.6|kg|lb}} Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.\nThe ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu Official DC18 Page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034703/http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu|date=March 11, 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n|DC24\n|''no image''\n|2008\n|A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 [[airwatt]]s of suction power. It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner.\u21b5Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely. Was superseded by the DC50 in November 2012\n|-\n|DC25\n|\"no image\"\n|2008\n|The DC25 was the replacement for the DC18, and was a scaled down, smaller version of the DC15 ball, and a larger version of the DC24. It was replaced by the DC41 in 2011. Like the DC15, it featured a suction motor located inside the ball, and separate brushroll motor which could be switched on and off independently of the suction motor, for using the vacuum cleaner on hard floors. It featured a post motor filter also inside the ball.\n|-\n|DC27\n|''no image''\n|''12 May 2009''\n|The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and \"root-cyclone\" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/Vacuumcleaners/Uprights/DC27/DC27-All-Floors.aspx Shop online for Dyson vacuum cleaners, fans, heaters, accessories and spare parts | Dyson Shop<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n|DC28\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar (\"Dyson Airmuscle\") controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.\n|-\n|DC33\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red).\nThe DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model  more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.\nThe DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14.  This unit has been discontinued as of July 2013. No replacement model has been announced.\n\nIn mainland Europe, the DC33c is a cylinder machine known as the \"Allergy Musclehead\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://manchestervacs.co.uk/DysonForum/index.php?topic=1280.0|title=When is a DC33 not a DC33?

The DC40 vacuum is Dyson's counterpart to the previously released DC41 Animal. The DC40 has Multifloor and Animal editions that utilise the Dyson ball technology. In 2015, following the introduction of the 2014 EU regulations, the DC40 was slightly modified to its powerhead and motor, whereby the motor was re-rated 700W, and the powerhead gained much more aggressive agitation and had the carpet guard strips removed. The DC40 (ERP) was replaced in 2017 by the Dyson Light Ball.\n|-\n|DC41\n|''no image''\n|2011\n|The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology. In 2015, the DC41 was updated to become the DC41 MK2, in which it was made compliant with the new 2014 EU directives for mains powered vacuum cleaners, and its motor changed to a 700W rated motor, and its powerhead was revised to take into account its lower powered suction motor. The DC41 MK2 was later renamed simply the \"Dyson Ball\", but is still known as DC41 MK2 in certain retail stores.\n|-\n|DC42\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC43\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC50\n|''no image''\n|2012\n|The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4&nbsp;kg (11.9&nbsp;lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47.

Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.\n\nThe DC02 was available in several special editions:\n*The [[De Stijl]] was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.\n*The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.\n*The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating [[Ranulph Fiennes|Sir Ranulph Fiennes's]] solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.\n*The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.\n|-\n|DC05\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a \"powernozzle\", a floor nozzle with a motorized brushroll bar for improved performance on carpets.\n|-\n|DC08\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new \"Animal\" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal from carpets and furnishings \u2013 they also came equipped with Hepa post-motor filters.\nNone of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output could drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.\n\nLower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better-suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose.\nThe DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19. Early in the production run of the DC08, in 2002, Dyson switched production of all its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new production facility in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC08T\n|''no image''\n|2003\n|Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'.

Launched around 2003.\nIt had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.\n|-\n|DC12\n|''no image''\n|2005\n|Small cylinder machine released in Japan.

Some versions of the V6, such as the Animal Extra and the Total Clean come with a 35W main powerhead with 75% more brushbar power than the standard head. The V6 develops 28 Airwatts of suction in its extended runtime mode, and 100 Airwatts of suction in its MAX mode, but runtime on a full charge in MAX mode is limited to 6 minutes. Runtime on a full charge using extended run time mode is 20 minutes with the non motorised tools attached, and 15 \u2013 17 minutes with the motorised heads attached. The V6 has been an immensely successful machine for Dyson, but did have issues such as a short runtime, a small dust cup capacity and less than easy dust cup removal, which were all addressed with the next generation of cordless models, the V8 and V7 ranges, which are due to replace the V6.\n|-\n|V8\n|2016\n|The Dyson V8 is an upgraded version of the V6 with better battery life (up to 40 mins without the brush heads),<ref name=\"homecleanexpert.com\">{{cite web|url=https://homecleanexpert.com/best-cordless-vacuum-for-hardwood-floors/#dysonV8|title=Cordless Vacuum Reviews|website=Home Clean Expert|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> a larger dust cup capacity, modifications to the debris emptying process (Called the \"Hygienic dirt ejection system\"), and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor HEPA filter. The V8 produces 22 Air watts of suction on normal (extended runtime) power (28 on the V6) and 115 airwatts in MAX mode (100 on the V6). Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors, which are a 50W main motorised powerhead with nylon and carbon fibre filaments for carpet use and hard floor dusting, a 20W \"Fluffy\" soft roller head for hard floor cleaning, and a 20W mini motorised head, with nylon bristles. Runtimes of the V8 in extended run time mode are 40 minutes with non motorised tools attached, 30 minutes with the fluffy head or mini motorised head attached, and 25 minutes with the main 50W powerhead attached. In MAX mode, the run times are approximately 7 minutes regardless of what tools are fitted. The V8 has full HEPA filtration provided by a removable and washable HEPA exhaust filter located on the back of the motor housing. The HEPA filter system was carried over from the V6 Absolute. The V8 also has a washable pre-motor filter so theoretically no filter replacements should be necessary during the life of the machine. The battery on the V8 is replaceable if necessary.\n|-\n|V7\n|2017\n|Based off the design and overall look of the Dyson V8, the V7, which was launched in 2017, uses a similar digital motor and accessories. However, being a less expensive model to purchase, it has some differences to the higher priced V8. The battery can only run the V7 for up to 30 minutes on a full charge, whereas the V8 can run for up to 40 minutes. The V7 is equipped with a 35W main motorised powerhead, compared to one with 50W on the V8, and also some models of V7 come with a 20W mini electric turbo tool of a slightly differing design to that of the V8. As it has a physically smaller battery than the V8, the V7 weighs less than the V8. In terms of performance, the V7 produces 21 Airwatts of suction on \"extended run time\" mode, compared to 22 on the V8 and 28 on the V6, and it produces 100 Airwatts (as on the V6) on Max mode, compared to 115 airwatts on the V8. Most models of V7 do not come equipped with a HEPA removable exhaust filter. Like the V8, the V7 incorporates the hygienic dirt ejection system, and the quick release \"red button\" tools system, and it also has the same, larger dust cup capacity of the V8. It also, like the V8, runs for up to 7 minutes, when put in Max mode.\n|-\n|V8 Carbon Fiber\n|\n|2017\n|The Dyson V8 Carbon Fiber is an upgrade version of V8 with a much more powerful motor. The V8 Carbon Fiber produces 155 AW (115 AW on the original V8) in MAX mode. The battery can also run 40 minutes (same as original V8) in the normal mode.\n|-\n|V10\n|\n|2018\n|The Dyson V10, launched in March 2018, is an upgrade version of previous V8 with a much more powerful motor (V8: 108,000 rpm / V10: 125,000 rpm). It has a much larger bin capacity, \"point and shoot\" hygienic bin emptying system, and a single \"all in one\" washable filter consisting of both the pre-motor and post motor filter. It has 3 motor speeds compared to 2 for the V6, V7 and V8.\n\nThere are two distinct models of the V10 with differing motors, filter assemblies and bin sizes. The V10 with larger bin gives 15.8 airwatts on low speed, the medium speed gives 33 airwatts, and the maximum speed gives 151 airwatts of suction. Run times are extended up to 60 minutes for speed setting 1 (15.8 Airwatts) with no motorised floorhead attached. The machine will run for 5 minutes in MAX speed (151 Airwatts) setting, 20 minutes in the second speed  (33 Airwatts) setting with the motorised large powerhead, and 30 minutes in the lowest speed (15.8 Airwatts) setting, with the motorised large powerhead fitted. A smaller version of the V10 with a V8 sized bin was released with a different motor with a maximum airwattage of 130 and smaller combined filter assembly. Like the V8, it has a wall mounting unit which it can be charged in, and charge time from empty is 3.5 hours. It comes with the same type of large motorised  powerheads as the V8, consisting of the direct drive motorhead, and the \"fluffy\" hard floor motorised head.

It was the first to use \"Dual Cyclone\" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.\n|-\n|DC01\n|''no image''\n|1993\n|The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, May 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented \"Dual Cyclone\" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.\nThe DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of \"brush control\" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration \u2013 standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The [[suction power]] of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.\n|-\n|DC03\n|''no image''\n|1997\n|The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9&nbsp;kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of [[HEPA]] filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball\n|-\n|DC04\n|''no image''\n|1998\n|The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushroll bar introduced on the DC03.\n|-\n|DC07\n|[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|frameless|261x261px]]\n|2001\n|The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a  cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.\nThe DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9&nbsp;kg.\nThe DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations. During the DC07 production run, in 2002, Dyson switched all manufacturing of its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new factory in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC14\n|''no image''\n|2004\n|The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. {{As of|2012|1}} listed as \"End of Line\" on Dyson Web site.\n|-\n|DC15\n|[[File:Dyson DC15.jpg|frameless|159x159px]]\n|2005\n|The DC15, known as ''The Ball'' was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal, and is loosely based on the DC14. It was the first vacuum to use a ball instead of existing static wheels, so as to make it more possible to steer and maneuver the cleaner around obstacles and corners, in conjunction with a [[universal joint]] mechanism on the cleaner head, by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the \"Ball\" system originated from the [[Ballbarrow]], James Dyson's first invention.\nThe DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the \"ball\".\n\nDue to its high launch price, its weight ({{Convert|8.6|kg|lb}}), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.\n|-\n|DC17\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allbrands.com/images/products_spec/L_17932_DC17animal.jpg|title=Level 3 Root Cyclone}}</ref> This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.\nThe second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with [[Europe]]an carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for [[North America]] with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.\n\nThe third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and [[titanium]] as the main colour for the entire machine.<ref>[http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17 Official DC17 page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201104533/http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17|date=February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n|-\n|DC18\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The {{Convert|6.6|kg|lb}} Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.\nThe ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu Official DC18 Page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034703/http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu|date=March 11, 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n|DC24\n|''no image''\n|2008\n|A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 [[airwatt]]s of suction power. It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner.\u21b5Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely.

It was replaced by the DC41 in 2011. Like the DC15, it featured a suction motor located inside the ball, and separate brushroll motor which could be switched on and off independently of the suction motor, for using the vacuum cleaner on hard floors. It featured a post motor filter also inside the ball.\n|-\n|DC27\n|''no image''\n|''12 May 2009''\n|The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and \"root-cyclone\" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/Vacuumcleaners/Uprights/DC27/DC27-All-Floors.aspx Shop online for Dyson vacuum cleaners, fans, heaters, accessories and spare parts | Dyson Shop<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n|DC28\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar (\"Dyson Airmuscle\") controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.\n|-\n|DC33\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red).\nThe DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model  more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.\nThe DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14.

In 2015, following the introduction of the 2014 EU regulations, the DC40 was slightly modified to its powerhead and motor, whereby the motor was re-rated 700W, and the powerhead gained much more aggressive agitation and had the carpet guard strips removed. The DC40 (ERP) was replaced in 2017 by the Dyson Light Ball.\n|-\n|DC41\n|''no image''\n|2011\n|The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology. In 2015, the DC41 was updated to become the DC41 MK2, in which it was made compliant with the new 2014 EU directives for mains powered vacuum cleaners, and its motor changed to a 700W rated motor, and its powerhead was revised to take into account its lower powered suction motor. The DC41 MK2 was later renamed simply the \"Dyson Ball\", but is still known as DC41 MK2 in certain retail stores.\n|-\n|DC42\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC43\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC50\n|''no image''\n|2012\n|The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4&nbsp;kg (11.9&nbsp;lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47. In Canada it is called the DC51. In 2015, the DC50 was renamed the \"Small Ball\" and underwent a few minor changes.\n|-\n|DC51\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A lightweight upright model<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dysoncanada.ca/en-CA/vacuum-cleaners/upright/dc51.aspx|title=DC51:access_date=6 May 2015}}</ref> \"with two tiers of smaller cyclones\".\n|-\n|DC55\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|Currys (UK) Exclusive model. Same as the Dyson Ball and DC41 MK2 but with extra tools and a red colour on the cyclone bins. ***Still available as at Dec 2017 but shortly to be discontinued due to its non-compliance with the maximum allowable noise level set by the EU in Sep 2017.\n|}\n\n==== Cylinder ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Model name\n!Image\n!Launch year\n!Description\n|-\n|DC02\n|''no image''\n|1995\n|The DC02, launched in 1995, was the first cylinder (canister) model sold by Dyson. Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.\n\nThe DC02 was available in several special editions:\n*The [[De Stijl]] was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.\n*The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.\n*The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating [[Ranulph Fiennes|Sir Ranulph Fiennes's]] solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.\n*The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.\n|-\n|DC05\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a \"powernozzle\", a floor nozzle with a motorized brushroll bar for improved performance on carpets.\n|-\n|DC08\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new \"Animal\" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings \u2013 they also came equipped with Hepa post motor filters.\nNone of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.\n\nLower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose.\nThe DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19. Early in the production run of the DC08, in 2002, Dyson switched production of all its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new production facility in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC08T\n|''no image''\n|2003\n|Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'. Wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine. Launched in 2003\n|-\n|DC11\n|''no image''\n|2003\n|The DC11 was the first Dyson cylinder cleaner with Telescope wrap. Launched around 2003.\nIt had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.\n|-\n|DC12\n|''no image''\n|2005\n|Small cylinder machine released in Japan. Launched near 2005.\n|-\n|DC12plus\n|''no image''\n|2005\n|Small cylinders in Japan.

This model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original DC19.\nStill a current model as of November 2012.\n|-\n|DC20\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|'Stowaway', as DC19 but with telescope wrap. Dyson have updated the DC08T (part of the DC08) series to form the DC20. Called the Dyson Stowaway in the UK. The colour scheme is new, and the cleaner is available in Standard, Allergy and Animal.\n|-\n|DC21\n|''no image''\n|2008\n|Entering into the American Market in 2008, this model is known as the Stowaway in the [[United States]], but as the Motorhead in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries. It is the second cylinder vacuum from Dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle. It is an advance on the DC08 Telescopic Wrap system, discontinued in some countries including the United Kingdom.\n|-\n|DC22\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|Known as \"Dyson Baby\" or \"Dyson Compact\" or \"Dyson Allergy\" and two-thirds the size of the DC23. Using the Dyson Digital Motor and Core Separation which adds a third cyclone 'layer' to filter out smaller particles. Has turbine head and motor head versions.\n|-\n|DC23\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|DC23 is similar in design to the DC21 but uses the new Core Separation that is also in the DC22. There is also a turbinehead animal version in [[Canada]].\n|-\n|DC23 T2\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A DC23 with different accessories and tools.\n|-\n|DC26\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|Ultra compact cylinder model, the DC26, known as the Dyson \"City\" is the World's smallest vacuum with constant suction. Even smaller than the DC22. The machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of A4 paper. With a very small dust container of 0.68 litres, and cord length of 5 metres, it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors. It weighs just 5.6&nbsp;kg and has an impressive 160 AirWatts suction power.\n|-\n|DC29\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|In [[Australia]] the DC29 is a cylinder model, an improved version of DC19. Very similar to DC19T2, the main differences being colour and tooling and non-HEPA machine. A HEPA filter is now included in 2012 'Multi-Floor' white models. In Canada, the DC29 is actually an upright model similar to the DC25. This appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an Upright OR a Cylinder depending on country of destination\nSupplied to [[Continental Europe]] and Australia (Cylinder type) and Canada (Upright type) (Not available in the UK).

Persico]], that tells the story of the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part one===\nAt the close of [[World War II]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) surrenders to the Americans and enjoys the hospitality of a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] base. [[Samuel Rosenman]] ([[Max von Sydow]]), acting on the orders of [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], recruits [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) to prepare a war crimes tribunal against G\u00f6ring and the surviving [[Nazi]] leadership. G\u00f6ring, [[Albert Speer]] ([[Herbert Knaup]]) and others are arrested for [[war crime]]s and imprisoned in a [[U.S. Army]] stockade at [[Mondorf-les-Bains|Bad Mondorf]] in [[Luxembourg]]. Jackson, his assistant Elsie Douglas ([[Jill Hennessy]]), and his prosecution team fly to [[Germany]].  Psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] ([[Matt Craven]]) arrives at the stockade with prisoner [[Hans Frank]] (Frank Moore), who has attempted [[suicide]].\n\nJackson negotiates with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] representatives [[David Maxwell-Fyfe|Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] ([[Christopher Plummer]]), General [[Iona Nikitchenko]] (Len Doncheff) and [[Henri Donnedieu de Vabres]] ([[Paul H\u00e9bert]]) to ensure a unified prosecution. Jackson selects the [[Nuremberg Palace of Justice]] for the site of the trials and reconstruction work commences. G\u00f6ring and the others are stripped of their rank and transferred to the prison in [[Nuremberg]], where they come into conflict with the guards under the command of the strict Colonel [[Burton C. Andrus]] ([[Michael Ironside]]). Major [[Airey Neave]] (Geoffrey Pounsett) serves G\u00f6ring, Speer and the others with their indictments. U.S. judge [[Francis Biddle]] ([[Len Cariou]]) arrives to take control of the court but reluctantly passes the honour at Jackson's insistence. Following the [[suicide]] of prisoner [[Robert Ley]] ([[Julien Poulin]]), round-the-clock watches are posted and Gilbert is appointed prisoner liaison.\n\n[[Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey|Sir Geoffrey Lawrence]] (David Francis) opens the trial with all defendants pleading not guilty, and Jackson gives a stirring opening statement. At lunch a jovial G\u00f6ring holds court over the other defendants while Speer begins to show signs of remorse. Maxwell-Fyfe puts forward an emotive eyewitness account of the Nazis' [[genocide|genocidal]] policies toward [[Jew]]s and others, while Jackson reads out dry documentation. As the court begins to tire of Jackson's meticulous approach, Maxwell-Fyfe urges pushing on to the witness interviews, which reveal the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camps]]. The court is shaken by documentary footage of the camps; even G\u00f6ring appears unsettled.\n\n===Part two===\nSpeer explains G\u00f6ring's dominance to Gilbert and insists that his control over the others must be broken. G\u00f6ring takes the stand and begins speaking to the [[German people]]. Jackson, at Gilbert's suggestion, has G\u00f6ring isolated. Under [[cross-examination]], G\u00f6ring outmaneuvers and humiliates Jackson, who later accuses Biddle of giving G\u00f6ring free rein in court. Douglas talks Jackson out of tendering his resignation, and the two share a kiss. Under advice from Maxwell-Fyfe, Jackson returns to confront G\u00f6ring with evidence of his crimes against the Jews and successfully dismisses the defendant\u2019s denials.\n\nAt a [[Christmas]] party, the German housekeeper refuses to serve the [[Soviet]]s, but Douglas rescues the situation before slipping away with Jackson. Gilbert visits the defendants and, under Jackson's advice, attempts to convince them to take responsibility for their crimes. Andrus relaxes the prison rules for Christmas, and G\u00f6ring shares a friendly drink with his guard, Lt. Tex Wheelis (Scott Gibson). The cross-examination of the defendants intensifies and the defence calls [[Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]] ([[Colm Feore]]), who casually reveals the horrors of [[Auschwitz]]. Speer is implicated in the [[slavery|enslavement]] of foreign workers by fellow defendant [[Fritz Sauckel]] ([[Ken Kramer]]) and in response accepts collective responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.\n\nGilbert interviews G\u00f6ring's wife [[Emmy G\u00f6ring|Emmy]] ([[Susan Glover]]), who reveals that [[Hitler]] had ordered them all executed, which led to the family's surrender. Jackson is moved by Gilbert's [[summation]] of his examinations \u2014 that the source of the evil behind [[Nazi Germany]] was a complete lack of [[empathy]] \u2014 to give an impassioned closing statement. G\u00f6ring uses his final statement to condemn the trial, and is sentenced along with several others to death by [[hanging]]. Speer uses his final statement to commend the tribunal and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. G\u00f6ring commits [[suicide]] after his request to be executed by [[firing squad]] is denied. Andrus presides over the executions of the others while Jackson and Douglas head home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alec Baldwin]] as Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H.

In reality, G\u00f6ring, after sending an aide to Brigadier General Robert I. Stack in which he offered to surrender to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] personally, was discovered and arrested in a traffic jam near [[Radstadt]] by a detachment of the [[Seventh United States Army]], which was sent through the German lines to find him and bring him to a secure American position, on 6 May 1945.<ref>The 36th Infantry Division Association Library</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Keitel]] was described in the film as an admiral during the defendants' sentencing. He was in fact a field marshal and would not have been identified with naval rank. However, he is correctly addressed as field marshal in other parts of the film.\n\nIn the film Jackson describes the Nuremberg's Justice Palace as \"the same building where Nuremberg Laws were decreed to deprive all the German Jews all of their rights\". In reality, the Nuremberg Laws were introduced by the Reichstag at a special meeting at the annual Nuremberg Rally of the NSDAP. Nuremberg's Justice Palace was, as it has always been, a regional court for the local area and the building had no association with the annual Party Rally during the Nazi era.\n\nJustice Jackson is portrayed as initially failing in his cross-examination of G\u04e7ring and emerging triumphant on the second day. In reality, the cross-examination was a disaster and severely damaged Jackson's reputation. This situation was recovered by Maxwell Fyfe.\n\nThe verdicts and sentences were pronounced together with all defendants present. In reality, verdicts and sentences were pronounced separately and the defendants were called one at a time into the courtroom to learn their sentence. Andrus was not present at the executions.\n\nWhen the defendants were indicted by Major Neave they all made verbal statements. In reality these statements were collected by Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]]. He asked the defendants to write their first reactions on a copy of the indictments.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974).</ref>\n\nIn the film [[Albert Speer]] was arrested when he was giving a lecture to American soldiers. In reality Speer was arrested together with [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Alfred Jodl]] in [[Flensburg]] where they had set up a provisional government.<ref>Richard Overy, ''Interrogations. The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945'' (2001).</ref>\n\nIn the film Captain Gilbert is graciously given the right to talk to the prisoners by Col. Andrus in exchange for a library and an exercise field. In reality Gilbert was specifically appointed to talk to the prisoners by the US military. The idea was that Andrus was informed by Gilbert about the state of mind of the prisoners.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974) page 3.</ref>\n\nThe tribunal is depicted as having four judges. In reality, there were eight, a senior and a junior from each of the four Allied powers.\n\nDuring the sentencing [[Wilhelm Keitel]] is referred to as Admiral, while he was actually a ''Generalfeldmarschall''\n\nG\u00f6ring's suicide is discovered when the guards come for Joachim von Ribbentrop when in real life, G\u00f6ring himself was to go first. Ribbentrop only went first after G\u00f6ring's suicide.\n\nAt the executions, the condemned state their names on the gallows and make their final statements in English. In reality, the condemned said their names before marching to the gallows and spoke in German, with an interpreter on the gallows. In addition, all executions appear to be carried out correctly. In real life, some of the hangings were reportedly botched as witnesses say not all of the executed Nazis fell with enough force to break the neck, and the trap door was too small causing bleeding head injuries to some of the men, as shown in pictures of the bodies.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Award!!Category!!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[53rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries|Outstanding Miniseries]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]]\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Outstanding Single Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Movie\n|Won\n|-\n|Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[58th Golden Globe Awards]]\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film|Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[7th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated [[Alec Baldwin]]\n|-\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"12\"|16th [[Gemini Awards]]\n|Best Dramatic Mini-Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated (Yves Simoneau)\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|  Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Original Music Score for a Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Production Design or Art Direction in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Achievement in Make-Up\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Costume Design\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Overall Sound in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Sound Editing in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Won\n|-\n|2001 [[PGA Awards]]\n|Television Producer of the Year Award in Longform\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2001 [[Satellite Awards]]\n|Best Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Won ([[Jill Hennessy]])\n|}\n\n==Streaming==\nAs of 2017 part 1 & 2 was released online on Canada Media Fund's Encore+ YouTube channel.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0208629|Nuremberg}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1102961-nuremberg}}\n{{Yves Simoneau}}\n\n[[Category:2000s Canadian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Docudramas]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yves Simoneau]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Holocaust films]]\n[[Category:World War II television drama series]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg in fiction]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg trials]]\n[[Category:Gemini and Canadian Screen Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries winners]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian television miniseries]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name      = Nuremberg\n|image          = Nuremberg (2000 film).jpg\n|caption        = \n|aka            = \n|genre          = [[Docudrama]]\n|creator        = \n|writer         = David W.

Andrus relaxes the prison rules for Christmas, and G\u00f6ring shares a friendly drink with his guard, Lt. Tex Wheelis (Scott Gibson). The cross-examination of the defendants intensifies and the defence calls [[Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]] ([[Colm Feore]]), who casually reveals the horrors of [[Auschwitz]]. Speer is implicated in the [[slavery|enslavement]] of foreign workers by fellow defendant [[Fritz Sauckel]] ([[Ken Kramer]]) and in response accepts collective responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.\n\nGilbert interviews G\u00f6ring's wife [[Emmy G\u00f6ring|Emmy]] ([[Susan Glover]]), who reveals that [[Hitler]] had ordered them all executed, which led to the family's surrender. Jackson is moved by Gilbert's [[summation]] of his examinations \u2014 that the source of the evil behind [[Nazi Germany]] was a complete lack of [[empathy]] \u2014 to give an impassioned closing statement. G\u00f6ring uses his final statement to condemn the trial, and is sentenced along with several others to death by [[hanging]]. Speer uses his final statement to commend the tribunal and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. G\u00f6ring commits [[suicide]] after his request to be executed by [[firing squad]] is denied. Andrus presides over the executions of the others while Jackson and Douglas head home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alec Baldwin]] as Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H.

In reality, G\u00f6ring, after sending an aide to Brigadier General Robert I. Stack in which he offered to surrender to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] personally, was discovered and arrested in a traffic jam near [[Radstadt]] by a detachment of the [[Seventh United States Army]], which was sent through the German lines to find him and bring him to a secure American position, on 6 May 1945.<ref>The 36th Infantry Division Association Library</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Keitel]] was described in the film as an admiral during the defendants' sentencing. He was in fact a field marshal and would not have been identified with naval rank. However, he is correctly addressed as field marshal in other parts of the film.\n\nIn the film Jackson describes the Nuremberg's Justice Palace as \"the same building where Nuremberg Laws were decreed to deprive all the German Jews all of their rights\". In reality, the Nuremberg Laws were introduced by the Reichstag at a special meeting at the annual Nuremberg Rally of the NSDAP. Nuremberg's Justice Palace was, as it has always been, a regional court for the local area and the building had no association with the annual Party Rally during the Nazi era.\n\nJustice Jackson is portrayed as initially failing in his cross-examination of G\u04e7ring and emerging triumphant on the second day. In reality, the cross-examination was a disaster and severely damaged Jackson's reputation. This situation was recovered by Maxwell Fyfe.\n\nThe verdicts and sentences were pronounced together with all defendants present. In reality, verdicts and sentences were pronounced separately and the defendants were called one at a time into the courtroom to learn their sentence. Andrus was not present at the executions.\n\nWhen the defendants were indicted by Major Neave they all made verbal statements. In reality these statements were collected by Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]]. He asked the defendants to write their first reactions on a copy of the indictments.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974).</ref>\n\nIn the film [[Albert Speer]] was arrested when he was giving a lecture to American soldiers. In reality Speer was arrested together with [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Alfred Jodl]] in [[Flensburg]] where they had set up a provisional government.<ref>Richard Overy, ''Interrogations. The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945'' (2001).</ref>\n\nIn the film Captain Gilbert is graciously given the right to talk to the prisoners by Col. Andrus in exchange for a library and an exercise field. In reality Gilbert was specifically appointed to talk to the prisoners by the US military. The idea was that Andrus was informed by Gilbert about the state of mind of the prisoners.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974) page 3.</ref>\n\nThe tribunal is depicted as having four judges. In reality, there were eight, a senior and a junior from each of the four Allied powers.\n\nG\u00f6ring's suicide is discovered when the guards come for Joachim von Ribbentrop when in real life, G\u00f6ring himself was to go first. Ribbentrop only went first after G\u00f6ring's suicide.\n\nAt the executions, the condemned state their names on the gallows and make their final statements in English. In reality, the condemned said their names before marching to the gallows and spoke in German, with an interpreter on the gallows. In addition, all executions appear to be carried out correctly. In real life, some of the hangings were reportedly botched as witnesses say not all of the executed Nazis fell with enough force to break the neck, and the trap door was too small causing bleeding head injuries to some of the men, as shown in pictures of the bodies.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Award!!Category!!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[53rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries|Outstanding Miniseries]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]]\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Outstanding Single Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Movie\n|Won\n|-\n|Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[58th Golden Globe Awards]]\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film|Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[7th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated [[Alec Baldwin]]\n|-\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"12\"|16th [[Gemini Awards]]\n|Best Dramatic Mini-Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated (Yves Simoneau)\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|  Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Original Music Score for a Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Production Design or Art Direction in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Achievement in Make-Up\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Costume Design\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Overall Sound in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Sound Editing in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Won\n|-\n|2001 [[PGA Awards]]\n|Television Producer of the Year Award in Longform\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2001 [[Satellite Awards]]\n|Best Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Won ([[Jill Hennessy]])\n|}\n\n==Streaming==\nAs of 2017 part 1 & 2 was released online on Canada Media Fund's Encore+ YouTube channel.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0208629|Nuremberg}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1102961-nuremberg}}\n{{Yves Simoneau}}\n\n[[Category:2000s Canadian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Docudramas]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yves Simoneau]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Holocaust films]]\n[[Category:World War II television drama series]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg in fiction]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg trials]]\n[[Category:Gemini and Canadian Screen Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries winners]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian television miniseries]]\n", "name_user": "Bramvr", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistorical inaccuracies:Addition of inaccurate rank for Wilhelm Keitel", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_(miniseries)"}

The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, while the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Additionally, events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\", airing between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash'', and a two-issue comic featuring characters and concepts unable to appear in the live-action episodes, tie into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which is inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". Moreover, the preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] served as a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several \"Paragons\" from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying all of reality. The crossover's events resulted in the Arrowverse's continuity being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014, with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", with the crossover title revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. In mid-2019, multiple castings were announced, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. \"Crisis\" also sees [[Cress Williams]] from fellow CW series ''Black Lightning'' appear and cross over with the Arrowverse for the first time, along with actors reprising their roles from various DC film and television series. Filming took place from the end of September 2019 until the beginning of November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming Crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect various items.<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> The former also retrieves the cadaver of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the Crisis date has moved up to December 2019 and that to save billions, the Flash must die.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> To learn more about what happens to him, Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse.

In the wake of Oliver's death, which he cannot undo because of the Anti-Monitor's growing power, the Monitor consults the Book of Destiny and learns of seven Paragons who could turn the tide; the \"Paragon of Hope\", Kara; the \"Paragon of Destiny\", Sara; the \"Paragon of Truth\", a Superman who has suffered \"more than any mortal man\"; and the \"Paragon of Courage\", who is described as the \"Bat of the Future\". Clark, Lois, and Iris locate the second Superman on [[Earth-96 (Arrowverse)|Earth-96]], though Lex uses the Book of Destiny to mind-control that Earth's Clark until Lois knocks Lex out. Kara and Kate travel to [[Earth-99 (Arrowverse)|Earth-99]], where the latter fails to recruit an elderly crippled [[Bruce Wayne (Arrowverse Earth-99)|Bruce Wayne]], who became a killer.

Iris, Ray, and [[Ralph Dibny (Arrowverse)|Ralph Dibny]] attempt to recruit a reluctant Choi, who eventually complies when Iris assures him that ordinary people can be heroes too. After the Monitor restores Cisco's powers, he, Barry, and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] meet up with Pariah at the Anti-Monitor's chamber beneath Central City, where they find an anti-matter cannon powered by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Flash]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]]. When Cisco frees Barry-90, the cannon goes critical, so Pariah recruits Jefferson from his recently-destroyed Earth to contain the energy. Barry-1 volunteers to destroy the cannon, which would result in his prophesied death.

Once Corrigan teaches him how to use the Spectre's power, Oliver heads to the Vanishing Point to rescue the Paragons and strengthen Barry's powers. With his increased speed, Barry drops off Kara, Choi, and Lex on Maltus, but loses everyone else across the Speed Force after being attacked by the Anti-Monitor. Despite an expected double-cross from Lex, Kara and Choi convince Novu not to go through with his plans. Once Barry retrieves everyone, they arrive at the dawn of time, only to learn the Anti-Monitor will always learn of the multiverse's existence as there will always be a version of Novu who cannot give up his ambitions.

While J'onn uses his psionic powers to bring their allies up to speed, Sara attempts to find Oliver, though without success. Later that night, the Paragons are attacked by shadow demons. A restored and remorseful Nash discovers that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and plotting to renew his destruction of the multiverse. To stop him once and for all, Nash, Ray, Barry, and Choi work to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity while the other heroes distract him. Once it is finished, Kara uses it on the Anti-Monitor, sending him to the microverse. Sometime later, Barry, Kara, Sara, Kate, Clark, J'onn, and Jefferson hold a memorial service for Oliver before agreeing to come together to protect their new world in his memory.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 5 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five |series=Legends of Tomorrow |series-link=Legends of Tomorrow |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=1 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of Supergirl characters|Supergirl]], [[List of Batwoman characters|Batwoman]], [[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

also|Arrowverse#Official crossover events}}\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was first hinted at in the Arrowverse in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319]] [[Arrowverse]] crossover,<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320]] crossover was already being discussed, with it already having \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said the producers for all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover,\"<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> while [[Marc Guggenheim]] stated \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for the it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title and premise as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain things in service of the forthcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> At that time, [[The CW]] President [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful ''Legends of Tomorrow'', which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications, would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event, spanning dates in both late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]]; this episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> When pitching the crossover to the studio and network early on, Guggenheim noted the creators stressed they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\", but to have the ability \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Speaking to the comparison of the crossover to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim felt \"for [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''\" adding, \"''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. \"Crisis\" is a semi-colon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n===Lead-up===\nIn May 2019, the season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' all featured teases for the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor making an appearance in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> Eric Wallace, showrunner of the sixth season of ''The Flash'', stated that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in service to the crossover's events. Wallace felt the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' with the villain [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the start of the season to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nThe majority of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season serves as a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with ''The Flash'' writers regarding the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', co-showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said the season would tease the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" He also highlighted the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]], [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother, as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, describing it as \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who portrays both the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover, the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him,\" adding, \"You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' featured an end tag scene with [[Nash Wells]] gaining access to a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", ahead of [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appearing in ''The Flash'' episode of the crossover. The episode saw red skies cover Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]], sending her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave eventually wipes them out, along with her Earth, except for Jefferson, who is teleported to an unknown location.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]], the writer of the 1985 original series, and Guggenheim, and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The issues also reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, with the second issue including material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). Speaking to the issues, Guggenheim said their conception \"came pretty early on in the process\" once it was realized the scope of the story would be more than the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" The four main characters of the comic are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]], and others.<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to include the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul instead because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\" so it felt like a main part of the story and not ancillary,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> adding, \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted exclusively in [[Walmart]] stores on December 15, 2019, with the second releasing on January 19, 2020, and releases in comic stores the month after.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The events of the comics occur during the first part of the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> The stories from both issues, plus behind-the-scenes extra, will be collected in a deluxe edition hardcover, set for release on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nEach part of the crossover was written by the following creative teams. The ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]] with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing the story,<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode,<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> and Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, with Eric Wallace conceiving the story.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to write the crossover. Guggenheim, who was the overall creative for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", began by creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". These moments were designed to be modular, meaning they could be moved between the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, the scheduling of actors, and other factors. This also helped determine the order each episode aired. Guggenheim's initial template was catered to ''Arrow'' being the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' being the fifth \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW then requested for ''The Flash'' to be the third hour, and after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\", leaving ''Batwoman'' as the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Within this, certain characters were considered \"integral\", while others would just make cameo appearances, should that actor be available to appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the individual writers then broke off to write each episode, before the group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments and moving moments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on their title character's scenes (for example, Supergirl's scenes on ''Batwoman'' were written by the ''Supergirl'' writers) to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] ensured the grounded tone of the series was kept to since it is \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> The story is considered \"a five-hour epic\" as opposed to individual episodes, but the title character of each series and characters appropriate for those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash''), were given highlights.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episodes' scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems, but since the Arrowverse does not have those, the crossover allowed the creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was further developed, after being teased at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in a way that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> The version of the Anti-Monitor that appears was also inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim stated the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, with the opening of the Arrowverse crossover showing the destruction of various parallel universes similarly to the comic's beginning.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Speaking to the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] from the comic storyline, Wallace conceded that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\" but a proper balance was found in killing some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Though it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover, which Guggenheim felt \"spoiled our own story\", his death in the first hour was done in an attempt to \"surprise the audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth. It was also done to \"establish the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> In the third hour, the death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\" without killing Gustin's character. Wallace thought this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while also \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was not originally scripted for inclusion, but was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies for a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Once again, this was done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\" according to Guggenheim, adding, \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nWith the inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover, it explored what happened to the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who portrays that series' Lois Lane, said, \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode, where the characters appear, was written by former writers on ''Smallville''. This allowed Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\" The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Despite having three actors who portray Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, there was never a scene written featuring all three. The writers wanted a clear distinction of [[Tom Welling]]'s character appearing at the Kent Farm and Routh's character appearing at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Guggenheim added, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live-action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was considered to be five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], who added, \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene was written by Certo, a fan of ''Lucifer'', and was sent to the creative team on ''Lucifer'' for their feedback. ''Lucifer'' co-showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, while Ellis contributed the bit of him saying \"Constantyne\" instead of \"Constantine\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\" since he wanted to participate once he knew the Arrowverse series were adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> The inclusion of Black Lightning in the crossover was decided \"very late in the game\" according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to figure out a way to incorporate the character in a way that would not be a simple cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". Once the logistics and creative elements were solved, having the character \"elevated the crossover to another level\". On the character's appearance, actor [[Cress Williams]] stated the character's entrance comes \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people.\" Williams added that because of this, there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; it was important to the writers that they could \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force, with Kate helping to break up the fight. The writers felt season six was \"relatively recent\", so they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode, one of Guggenheim's favorites, and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were also chosen based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". While in the Speed Force, Barry encountered [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics' Chief Creative Officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]]'s film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure it would not conflict with the planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar seen in the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover to a spot where the heroes could gather for future team-ups,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> along with a hint at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. These hints were a \"fun bit\" the writers knew they wanted to end the crossover on, with an early version of the scripts having the Wonder Twins make an appearance.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThough the early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising the role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not make an appearance. Guggenheim did not want to be beholden to this, pointing out that the newspaper headline mentioning him had been created by executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had also already featured prominently in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", was another character that appeared in early versions of the crossover. Ultimately, per Guggenheim, he was not included since \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics. This was \"a really important inclusion\" for Guggenheim, but \"for a variety of different reasons,\" it could not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett was upgraded to series regular status on all of the series, receiving the credit in the episodes he appears in before the crossover, to ensure he would have been available for \"Crisis\" and his appearances leading up to it.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> In July 2019 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], multiple castings for the crossover were announced. They included: [[Tyler Hoechlin]] reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]],<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> while [[Brandon Routh]], who portrays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman from the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), portraying \"an older, more world-weary\" version, inspired by the comics' [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]];<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh would portray [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], would appear in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell portraying multiple versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] reprising his role as Lex Luthor;<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett also portraying the Anti-Monitor in addition to the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly after, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was also confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nThe following month, at the [[Television Critics Association]], Pedowitz announced that cast members from the series ''Black Lightning'' would appear,<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> something star Cress Williams previously hinted at,<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and that Kevin Conroy would appear as an elderly Bruce Wayne, having previously voiced the character in multiple animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray the character in live action, having not done it previously. He also felt it would be an opportunity to satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', who also expressed interest in seeing Conroy portray the character on camera.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim also revealed the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. about the possibility of having [[Lynda Carter]] reprise her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|1975 television series]], but felt it was unlikely to happen.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\nIn September 2019, [[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]],<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and shortly after John Wesley Shipp was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Working on his series, Ellis \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and, 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", feeling \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection for the character.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In the middle of the month, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively, from ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance also returns to reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', revealed Warner Bros. and the producers approached him to reprise the role in \"Crisis\", but he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but he turned it down due to his scheduling conflicts with the series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> Ritchson does appear via archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> Later in the month, [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from the series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the start of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced to be reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], while also taking on the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] persona from the comics; Lyla previously used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The same month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> By that time, the producers had reached out to [[Nicolas Cage]], who at one point was attached to portray Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film, about appearing.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as [[Courtney Whitmore|<!--don't delink-->Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]], ahead of the release of [[Stargirl (TV series)|her series]] on the streaming service [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role of Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Despite production on the crossover being completed, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing, not wanting to do it if Gustin was not, and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" with the idea.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim also called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse for the Kent family farm took place at the end of the month.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> The farmhouse had previously been featured in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure his characterization was consistent with his series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Filming had completed by November 8, with some reshoots and minor filming having finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> Once Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' was used to film it since the ''Arrow'' crew had already wrapped on the series and was no longer around.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors on the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> These directors were hired specifically for the crossover, because of their previous experience working in the Arrowverse, allowing them to create a unified look, with help from their directors of photography. ''Batwoman'', which normally is filmed in a different [[aspect ratio]] than the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for a consistent look. Many of the stunt sequences, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]], along with his collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan, began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> with the score recorded by a live orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated many musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into his score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> some cues included the 1960s Batman television series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nAhead of the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired, and it was something each series \"have embraced\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim described it as \"it wasn't so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> He added that each series would be affected, outside of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" though there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Coming out of the crossover, Dries was looking to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounded nature established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the remainder of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\" and felt the Arrowverse ending was a \"game-changer\" that \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover, the universe had been rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}now existing on the newly established [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]; this was decided going into the crossover. A new multiverse was also created, with six of its Earths revealed.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Guggenheim said \"there is an opportunity going forward after \"Crisis\" to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Some of the changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter Sara returning to the timeline after being changed in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor having more heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after almost doing so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> For ''Batwoman'', the series sees Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice,<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> with Dries calling this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\n[[Boost Mobile]] served as a promotional partner for the event.<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> The first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teaser shorts.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the poster for the event was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> On November 24, 2019, a full trailer was released.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> A first long trailer for the event was released on December 3, 2019,<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /> and a second on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWith the release of the initial trailers in November, a logo for the event featuring the leading character from each of the series except Oliver Queen was revealed. Guggenheim claimed that, at that time, legal and financial reasons prevented them from including Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> However, with the release of the full trailer in December, Oliver was now included in the logo, which Guggenheim explained was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\" to allow the change to happen.<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> Guggenheim had been told \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", hence the initial exclusion of Amell because he does not appear in Part 5.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the final two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released.

response===\n====''Supergirl''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 13 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09|title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the first hour a 9 out of 10. He called the episode \"accessible\" for any viewer and felt it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". Schedeen also felt the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\". The episode was also deemed \"a very critical episode for ''Arrow'' fans\" given Oliver's death by Schedeen, though he was upset that Barry did not have a large role to play in the episode.<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare]us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\" of the episode.<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the opening of the episode \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". Siede was happy \"Crisis\" was the first crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover {{em|and}} a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" She also pointed out the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\". She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Awarding the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, Kayti Burt from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\" and overall, felt the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" Speaking to the cast in the episode, Burt said, \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific,\" which led to \"one of the best scenes\" between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09|title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09|title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the Spectre. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\" especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08|title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character stating, \"These final two episodes more than justify the decision to resurrect Ollie after his heroic sacrifice in Part 1. They do even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" it what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out Oliver Queen\".<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special.

[[Arrowverse]] [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event, featuring episodes of the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' on [[The CW]]. The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, while the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Additionally, events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\", airing between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash'', and a two-issue comic featuring characters and concepts unable to appear in the live-action episodes, tie into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which is inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". Moreover, the preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] served as a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several \"Paragons\" from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying all of reality. The crossover's events resulted in the Arrowverse's continuity being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014, with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", with the crossover title revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. In mid-2019, multiple castings were announced, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. \"Crisis\" also sees [[Cress Williams]] from fellow CW series ''Black Lightning'' appear and cross over with the Arrowverse for the first time, along with actors reprising their roles from various DC film and television series. Filming took place from the end of September 2019 until the beginning of November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming Crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect various items.<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> The former also retrieves the cadaver of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the Crisis date has moved up to December 2019 and that to save billions, the Flash must die.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> To learn more about what happens to him, Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse.

Clark and Lois narrowly send their son [[Jonathan Kent (Arrowverse)|Jonathan]] off into an escape pod just as the wave wipes out Argo alongside Alura. Harbinger brings Barry, [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Kate Kane]], [[Sara Lance]] and [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] to Earth-38, while also rescuing the Kents from Argo. Harbinger briefs the gathered heroes on the threat of the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] as the Monitor raises a quantum tower to impede the antimatter wave while the [[Department of Extranormal Operations (Arrowverse)|DEO]] and [[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena Luthor]] work to evacuate Earth-38's inhabitants to [[Earth-1 (Arrowverse)|Earth-1]]. Brainy locates Jonathan's pod on [[Earth-16 (Arrowverse)|Earth-16]], so he, Lois, and Sara leave to retrieve him while the others stay behind to fend off the Anti-Monitor's forces. In preparation for his death, Oliver passes the mantle of Green Arrow to Mia. When he learns Barry is fated to die however, he argues with the Monitor over the deal they made last year.{{efn|As depicted in the 2018 crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\".}} The heroes make their stand at the tower and fend off an army of shadow demons until the Monitor teleports them off-world, deeming the battle to be lost. Refusing to leave, Oliver temporarily nullifies the Monitor and stays behind to ensure the exodus succeeds. Back on Earth-1, Lois' team returns with Jonathan before the Monitor brings a dying Oliver to say good-bye, commenting that this was not how he was supposed to die. Nash, now a \"Pariah\" for releasing the Anti-Monitor, appears and announces that events have changed and everything is doomed.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 1 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One |series=Supergirl |series-link=Supergirl (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=9 |airdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the Earth-1 [[Legends of Tomorrow (Arrowverse team)|Legends]] unavailable, Harbinger recruits [[Earth-74 (Arrowverse)|Earth-74]]'s [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] so the heroes can use his ''Waverider'' as their base of operations. In the wake of Oliver's death, which he cannot undo because of the Anti-Monitor's growing power, the Monitor consults the Book of Destiny and learns of seven Paragons who could turn the tide; the \"Paragon of Hope\", Kara; the \"Paragon of Destiny\", Sara; the \"Paragon of Truth\", a Superman who has suffered \"more than any mortal man\"; and the \"Paragon of Courage\", who is described as the \"Bat of the Future\". Clark, Lois, and Iris locate the second Superman on [[Earth-96 (Arrowverse)|Earth-96]], though Lex uses the Book of Destiny to mind-control that Earth's Clark until Lois knocks Lex out. Kara and Kate travel to [[Earth-99 (Arrowverse)|Earth-99]], where the latter fails to recruit an elderly crippled [[Bruce Wayne (Arrowverse Earth-99)|Bruce Wayne]], who became a killer. Bruce is in turn accidentally electrocuted in a heated confrontation with Kate and Kara. Elsewhere on [[Earth-18 (Arrowverse)|Earth-18]], Sara, Barry, Mia, and [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] take Oliver's body to a [[Lazarus Pit]] in an attempt to resurrect him, but the accumulating antimatter across the multiverse prevents them from bringing his soul back. Back on the ''Waverider'', the Monitor tasks Ray with building a \"Paragon detector\", which identifies Kate as the true \"Paragon of Courage\". Unbeknownst to everyone, Harbinger is secretly contacted by the Anti-Monitor.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 2 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Two |series=Batwoman |series-link=Batwoman (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=1 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]]'s help, Ray's \"Paragon detector\" identifies Barry as the \"Paragon of Love\", [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]] as the \"Paragon of Honor\", and [[Ivy Town (Arrowverse)|Ivy Town]] scientist [[Ryan Choi (Arrowverse)|Ryan Choi]] as the \"Paragon of Humanity\". Iris, Ray, and [[Ralph Dibny (Arrowverse)|Ralph Dibny]] attempt to recruit a reluctant Choi, who eventually complies when Iris assures him that ordinary people can be heroes too. After the Monitor restores Cisco's powers, he, Barry, and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] meet up with Pariah at the Anti-Monitor's chamber beneath Central City, where they find an anti-matter cannon powered by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Flash]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]]. When Cisco frees Barry-90, the cannon goes critical, so Pariah recruits Jefferson from his recently-destroyed Earth to contain the energy. Barry-1 volunteers to destroy the cannon, which would result in his prophesied death. However, Barry-90 stops him, claiming the Monitor did not specify which Flash would die in the Crisis and takes his place. Meanwhile, Constantine, Mia, and Diggle visit [[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer]] on [[Earth-666 (Arrowverse)|Earth-666]] to get his help in entering [[Purgatory]] and retrieve Oliver's soul. Before they can leave, [[Jim Corrigan]] appears and bestows the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s power onto Oliver. He accepts, and Constantine's team is returned to the ''Waverider'' without him. While the heroes regroup, the Anti-Monitor sends a brainwashed Harbinger to kill the Monitor so he can absorb his power and finish destroying the multiverse. Before the remaining heroes and Earth-1 are destroyed, Pariah sends the Paragons to the Vanishing Point to keep them safe, where they witness Lex replace Superman-96 with himself using a page from the Book of Destiny.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 3 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three |series=The Flash |series-link=The Flash (2014 TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=6 |number=9 |airdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a flashback to the planet Maltus 10,000 years ago, Mar Novu experiments with time-travel to witness the birth of the universe, only to accidentally end up in the antimatter universe and reveal the multiverse's existence to the Anti-Monitor. In the months since the multiverse was destroyed, the Paragons have struggled to survive at the Vanishing Point. Once Corrigan teaches him how to use the Spectre's power, Oliver heads to the Vanishing Point to rescue the Paragons and strengthen Barry's powers. With his increased speed, Barry drops off Kara, Choi, and Lex on Maltus, but loses everyone else across the Speed Force after being attacked by the Anti-Monitor. Despite an expected double-cross from Lex, Kara and Choi convince Novu not to go through with his plans. Once Barry retrieves everyone, they arrive at the dawn of time, only to learn the Anti-Monitor will always learn of the multiverse's existence as there will always be a version of Novu who cannot give up his ambitions. The Paragons battle the Anti-Monitor and his shadow demons until Oliver uses the Spectre's power to restore the multiverse, with the Paragons providing additional assistance via Lex's Book of Destiny page. As a result however, Oliver dies a second and final time in Barry and Sara's arms.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 4 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=8 |number=8 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWaking up in the newly-recreated universe, the Paragons discover they are the only ones who remember the Crisis and that both Earth-38 and Jefferson's Earth were merged with Earth-1 into a composite universe later designated as [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]], among other changes throughout the multiverse. While J'onn uses his psionic powers to bring their allies up to speed, Sara attempts to find Oliver, though without success. Later that night, the Paragons are attacked by shadow demons. A restored and remorseful Nash discovers that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and plotting to renew his destruction of the multiverse. To stop him once and for all, Nash, Ray, Barry, and Choi work to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity while the other heroes distract him. Once it is finished, Kara uses it on the Anti-Monitor, sending him to the microverse. Sometime later, Barry, Kara, Sara, Kate, Clark, J'onn, and Jefferson hold a memorial service for Oliver before agreeing to come together to protect their new world in his memory.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 5 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five |series=Legends of Tomorrow |series-link=Legends of Tomorrow |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=1 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of Supergirl characters|Supergirl]], [[List of Batwoman characters|Batwoman]], [[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

also|Arrowverse#Official crossover events}}\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was first hinted at in the Arrowverse in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319]] [[Arrowverse]] crossover,<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320]] crossover was already being discussed, with it already having \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said the producers for all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover,\"<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> while [[Marc Guggenheim]] stated \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for the it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title and premise as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain things in service of the forthcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> At that time, [[The CW]] President [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful ''Legends of Tomorrow'', which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications, would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event, spanning dates in both late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]]; this episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> When pitching the crossover to the studio and network early on, Guggenheim noted the creators stressed they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\", but to have the ability \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Speaking to the comparison of the crossover to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim felt \"for [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''\" adding, \"''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. \"Crisis\" is a semi-colon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n===Lead-up===\nIn May 2019, the season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' all featured teases for the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor making an appearance in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> Eric Wallace, showrunner of the sixth season of ''The Flash'', stated that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in service to the crossover's events. Wallace felt the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' with the villain [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the start of the season to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nThe majority of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season serves as a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with ''The Flash'' writers regarding the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', co-showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said the season would tease the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" He also highlighted the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]], [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother, as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, describing it as \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who portrays both the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover, the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him,\" adding, \"You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' featured an end tag scene with [[Nash Wells]] gaining access to a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", ahead of [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appearing in ''The Flash'' episode of the crossover. The episode saw red skies cover Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]], sending her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave eventually wipes them out, along with her Earth, except for Jefferson, who is teleported to an unknown location.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]], the writer of the 1985 original series, and Guggenheim, and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The issues also reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, with the second issue including material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). Speaking to the issues, Guggenheim said their conception \"came pretty early on in the process\" once it was realized the scope of the story would be more than the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" The four main characters of the comic are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]], and others.<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to include the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul instead because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\" so it felt like a main part of the story and not ancillary,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> adding, \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted exclusively in [[Walmart]] stores on December 15, 2019, with the second releasing on January 19, 2020, and releases in comic stores the month after.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The events of the comics occur during the first part of the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> The stories from both issues, plus behind-the-scenes extra, will be collected in a deluxe edition hardcover, set for release on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nEach part of the crossover was written by the following creative teams. The ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]] with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing the story,<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode,<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> and Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, with Eric Wallace conceiving the story.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to write the crossover. Guggenheim, who was the overall creative for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", began by creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". These moments were designed to be modular, meaning they could be moved between the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, the scheduling of actors, and other factors. This also helped determine the order each episode aired. Guggenheim's initial template was catered to ''Arrow'' being the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' being the fifth \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW then requested for ''The Flash'' to be the third hour, and after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\", leaving ''Batwoman'' as the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Within this, certain characters were considered \"integral\", while others would just make cameo appearances, should that actor be available to appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the individual writers then broke off to write each episode, before the group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments and moving moments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on their title character's scenes (for example, Supergirl's scenes on ''Batwoman'' were written by the ''Supergirl'' writers) to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] ensured the grounded tone of the series was kept to since it is \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> The story is considered \"a five-hour epic\" as opposed to individual episodes, but the title character of each series and characters appropriate for those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash''), were given highlights.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episodes' scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems, but since the Arrowverse does not have those, the crossover allowed the creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was further developed, after being teased at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in a way that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> The version of the Anti-Monitor that appears was also inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim stated the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, with the opening of the Arrowverse crossover showing the destruction of various parallel universes similarly to the comic's beginning.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Speaking to the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] from the comic storyline, Wallace conceded that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\" but a proper balance was found in killing some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Though it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover, which Guggenheim felt \"spoiled our own story\", his death in the first hour was done in an attempt to \"surprise the audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth. It was also done to \"establish the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> In the third hour, the death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\" without killing Gustin's character. Wallace thought this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while also \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was not originally scripted for inclusion, but was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies for a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Once again, this was done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\" according to Guggenheim, adding, \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nWith the inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover, it explored what happened to the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who portrays that series' Lois Lane, said, \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode, where the characters appear, was written by former writers on ''Smallville''. This allowed Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\" The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Despite having three actors who portray Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, there was never a scene written featuring all three. The writers wanted a clear distinction of [[Tom Welling]]'s character appearing at the Kent Farm and Routh's character appearing at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Guggenheim added, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live-action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was considered to be five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], who added, \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene was written by Certo, a fan of ''Lucifer'', and was sent to the creative team on ''Lucifer'' for their feedback. ''Lucifer'' co-showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, while Ellis contributed the bit of him saying \"Constantyne\" instead of \"Constantine\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\" since he wanted to participate once he knew the Arrowverse series were adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> The inclusion of Black Lightning in the crossover was decided \"very late in the game\" according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to figure out a way to incorporate the character in a way that would not be a simple cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". Once the logistics and creative elements were solved, having the character \"elevated the crossover to another level\". On the character's appearance, actor [[Cress Williams]] stated the character's entrance comes \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people.\" Williams added that because of this, there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; it was important to the writers that they could \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force, with Kate helping to break up the fight. The writers felt season six was \"relatively recent\", so they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode, one of Guggenheim's favorites, and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were also chosen based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". While in the Speed Force, Barry encountered [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics' Chief Creative Officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]]'s film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure it would not conflict with the planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar seen in the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover to a spot where the heroes could gather for future team-ups,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> along with a hint at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. These hints were a \"fun bit\" the writers knew they wanted to end the crossover on, with an early version of the scripts having the Wonder Twins make an appearance.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThough the early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising the role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not make an appearance. Guggenheim did not want to be beholden to this, pointing out that the newspaper headline mentioning him had been created by executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had also already featured prominently in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", was another character that appeared in early versions of the crossover. Ultimately, per Guggenheim, he was not included since \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics. This was \"a really important inclusion\" for Guggenheim, but \"for a variety of different reasons,\" it could not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett was upgraded to series regular status on all of the series, receiving the credit in the episodes he appears in before the crossover, to ensure he would have been available for \"Crisis\" and his appearances leading up to it.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> In July 2019 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], multiple castings for the crossover were announced. They included: [[Tyler Hoechlin]] reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]],<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> while [[Brandon Routh]], who portrays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman from the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), portraying \"an older, more world-weary\" version, inspired by the comics' [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]];<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh would portray [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], would appear in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell portraying multiple versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] reprising his role as Lex Luthor;<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett also portraying the Anti-Monitor in addition to the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly after, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was also confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nThe following month, at the [[Television Critics Association]], Pedowitz announced that cast members from the series ''Black Lightning'' would appear,<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> something star Cress Williams previously hinted at,<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and that Kevin Conroy would appear as an elderly Bruce Wayne, having previously voiced the character in multiple animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray the character in live action, having not done it previously. He also felt it would be an opportunity to satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', who also expressed interest in seeing Conroy portray the character on camera.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim also revealed the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. about the possibility of having [[Lynda Carter]] reprise her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|1975 television series]], but felt it was unlikely to happen.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\nIn September 2019, [[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]],<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and shortly after John Wesley Shipp was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Working on his series, Ellis \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and, 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", feeling \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection for the character.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In the middle of the month, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively, from ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance also returns to reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', revealed Warner Bros. and the producers approached him to reprise the role in \"Crisis\", but he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but he turned it down due to his scheduling conflicts with the series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> Ritchson does appear via archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> Later in the month, [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from the series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the start of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced to be reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], while also taking on the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] persona from the comics; Lyla previously used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The same month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> By that time, the producers had reached out to [[Nicolas Cage]], who at one point was attached to portray Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film, about appearing.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as [[Courtney Whitmore|<!--don't delink-->Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]], ahead of the release of [[Stargirl (TV series)|her series]] on the streaming service [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role of Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Despite production on the crossover being completed, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing, not wanting to do it if Gustin was not, and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" with the idea.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim also called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse for the Kent family farm took place at the end of the month.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> The farmhouse had previously been featured in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure his characterization was consistent with his series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Filming had completed by November 8, with some reshoots and minor filming having finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> Once Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' was used to film it since the ''Arrow'' crew had already wrapped on the series and was no longer around.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors on the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> These directors were hired specifically for the crossover, because of their previous experience working in the Arrowverse, allowing them to create a unified look, with help from their directors of photography. ''Batwoman'', which normally is filmed in a different [[aspect ratio]] than the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for a consistent look. Many of the stunt sequences, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]], along with his collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan, began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> with the score recorded by a live orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated many musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into his score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> some cues included the 1960s Batman television series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nAhead of the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired, and it was something each series \"have embraced\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim described it as \"it wasn't so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> He added that each series would be affected, outside of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" though there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Coming out of the crossover, Dries was looking to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounded nature established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the remainder of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\" and felt the Arrowverse ending was a \"game-changer\" that \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover, the universe had been rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}now existing on the newly established [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]; this was decided going into the crossover. A new multiverse was also created, with six of its Earths revealed.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Guggenheim said \"there is an opportunity going forward after \"Crisis\" to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Some of the changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter Sara returning to the timeline after being changed in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor having more heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after almost doing so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> For ''Batwoman'', the series sees Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice,<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> with Dries calling this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\nThe first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> [[Boost Mobile]] served as a promotional partner for the event.<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teaser shorts.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the poster for the event was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> On November 24, 2019, a full trailer was released.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> A first long trailer for the event was released on December 3, 2019,<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /> and a second on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWith the release of the initial trailers in November, a logo for the event featuring the leading character from each of the series except Oliver Queen was revealed. Guggenheim claimed that, at that time, legal and financial reasons prevented them from including Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> However, with the release of the full trailer in December, Oliver was now included in the logo, which Guggenheim explained was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\" to allow the change to happen.<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> After the crossover concluded, Guggenheim said he had been told \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", hence the initial exclusion of Amell because he does not appear in Part 5.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the final two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released.

response===\n====''Supergirl''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 13 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09|title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the first hour a 9 out of 10. He called the episode \"accessible\" for any viewer and felt it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". Schedeen also felt the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\". The episode was also deemed \"a very critical episode for ''Arrow'' fans\" given Oliver's death by Schedeen, though he was upset that Barry did not have a large role to play in the episode.<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare]us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\" of the episode.<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the opening of the episode \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". Siede was happy \"Crisis\" was the first crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover {{em|and}} a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" She also pointed out the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\". She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Awarding the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, Kayti Burt from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\" and overall, felt the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" Speaking to the cast in the episode, Burt said, \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific,\" which led to \"one of the best scenes\" between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09|title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09|title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the Spectre. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\" especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08|title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character stating, \"These final two episodes more than justify the decision to resurrect Ollie after his heroic sacrifice in Part 1. They do even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" it what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out Oliver Queen\".<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special.

The first round is the \"Preliminary Heat\" where the bakers are first told of their themes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/shows/2015/09/halloween-baking-championship|title=Five Things You Didn\u2019t Know About \"Halloween Baking Championship\"}}</ref> and get varying cook times (anywhere from 30 minutes up to 2 hours) to create a small pastry (usual cookies or small cakes). The person who wins the first round gets an advantage going into the next round, and aren't told until after the second round is announced (and sometimes they're not told until the middle of cooking in the second round). The advantage varies by episode (''Ex'': exclusive use of a certain baking mold/ingredient or first choice of a specific theme).\n\nThe second round is called the \"Main Heat\" and the contestants get a considerably longer time to bake than the \"pre-heat\" (in the final round of the final episode they're given several hours to make a large confection). This larger dessert must fit a new theme presented (usually in the same vein as the pre-heat theme). One baker is eliminated every episode except for the last one. In the finale it's down to the final three or four contestants competing in a winner-take-all final round. The winner gets $25,000.\n\n==Host & Judges==\nUnlike its sister show, [[Holiday Baking Championship]], the panel of judges has changed each of the first three seasons (with the exception of Carla Hall). In each episode, the judges come out dressed in costume for the Main Heat, to keep with the spirit of Halloween.\n\nThe first season was hosted by Richard Blais with chefs Carla Hall, Ron Ben-Israel and Sherry Yard serving as judges. The second season saw Carla Hall as the only returning chef/judge. She was joined by Food Network personality Sandra Lee and Damiano Carrara to help judge, and Comedian Jeff Dunham was the host. Since season three, show has been hosted by John Henson. Lorraine Pascale and Zac Young joined Carla Hall as judges for the third and fourth seasons, while Katie Lee replaced Pascale for season five. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.multivu.com/players/English/79699512-food-network-halloween-baking-new-season/|title=Spellbinding Sweets Fill The New Season Of Halloween Baking Championship Hosted By John Henson}}</ref> \n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main| List of Halloween Baking Championship episodes}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\"|Originally aired\n|-\n!First aired\n!Last aired\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF7E00;

Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]].

With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first]] [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956, and the Governor-General was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent Governor-General, [[Iskander Mirza]], became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|suspended the]] first Constitution in 1958, and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Army Commander-in-Chief]] General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] as the first [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|chief martial law administrator]]. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|223x223px|[[Iskander Mirza]] became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956. ]]\nThe [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second]] Constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a [[presidential republic]] without [[Elections in Pakistan|direct elections]]. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, [[Fatima Jinnah]], for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Khan.\n\n[[File:Presidential standard of Pakistan (1974\u20131998).svg|thumb|left|200px|Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)]]\nControversy regarding the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]] (1960), [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]] (1963), and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|war]] with [[India]] (1965), fueled a fierce [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] opposition movement led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from [[paralysis]] and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General [[Yahya Khan]], [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|who imposed martial law]] and announced that nationwide elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in 1970 which saw the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) and the [[Awami League]] gaining a majority in [[East Pakistan]] (current day Bangladesh).\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited [[Nurul Amin]] of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], and also appointed him as the first [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice President]]. The growing instigated violence against [[Pakistanis]] in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use [[Operation Searchlight|force]] in order to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|order]] there, which further escalated [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bengali resistance]] (1970).  [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Preemptive strikes]] against [[India]] led to another [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war]] in 1971, which [[Independence of Bangladesh|freed]] [[East Pakistan]] and created [[Bangladesh]].\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of [[Pakistan]] after the [[Fall of Dhaka|fall]] of [[East Pakistan]], President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. President Bhutto created the current [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1973, transforming [[Pakistan]] into a [[parliamentary democracy]], and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]].\n\n===Past Interventions===\nThe [[1977 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|right-wing]] alliance, the [[Pakistan National Alliance]]. The events leading to it resulted in [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]]. Suspending the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] in 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's [[Zia regime|presidency]] oversaw the modern growth of [[Islamic fundamentalism|far-right ideas]] in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] held a [[1984 Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum|referendum]] (1984) and called for [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1985. President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] appointed [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Mohammad Junejo]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and assumed more [[Political power|powers]] through the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]]. After dismissing [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Junejo]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] announced that new [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] would be held, but President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|died in a plane crash]] in 1988.\n\nThe [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1988 witnessed the victory of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] in 1988, and appointed [[Chairman Senate]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] to the presidency. Conflict between [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] repeatedly intervened in government matters and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|leveled charges]] against [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]; thus [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1990. After holding [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1990, [[Nawaz Sharif]] brought up an ideologically [[First Sharif ministry|conservative government]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Allam]], President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] tendered resignations in 1993.\n\nFollowing the [[1993 Pakistani general election|new elections]] held in 1993, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] established a strong government after appointing loyalist [[Farooq Leghari]] to the presidency. However, the [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corruption charges]] and the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]] in 1996 resulted in President [[Farooq Leghari]] [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In 1997, President [[Farooq Leghari]] could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] by the public in [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997]].  President [[Farooq Leghari|Leghari]] unsuccessfully supported [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]]\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Executive]], and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. After appointing [[Rafiq Tarar]], the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] successfully passed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|self coup]] in 1999, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and President [[Rafiq Tarar]] in 2001 while assuming more [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|powers to the presidency]].  In January 2004, the [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] [[2004 Pakistani presidential election|elected]] Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Amy|title=Pakistan Gives Musharraf Confidence Vote as President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515004758/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|archivedate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary,]] and declared a [[2007 Pakistani martial law|state of emergency]] in 2007, after dismissing the [[List of Justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].

With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first]] [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956, and the Governor-General was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent Governor-General, [[Iskander Mirza]], became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|suspended the]] first Constitution in 1958, and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Army Commander-in-Chief]] General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] as the first [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|chief martial law administrator]]. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|223x223px|[[Iskander Mirza]] became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956. ]]\nThe [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second]] Constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a [[presidential republic]] without [[Elections in Pakistan|direct elections]]. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, [[Fatima Jinnah]], for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Khan.\n\n[[File:Presidential standard of Pakistan (1974\u20131998).svg|thumb|left|200px|Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)]]\nControversy regarding the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]] (1960), [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]] (1963), and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|war]] with [[India]] (1965), fueled a fierce [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] opposition movement led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from [[paralysis]] and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General [[Yahya Khan]], [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|who imposed martial law]] and announced that nationwide elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in 1970 which saw the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) and the [[Awami League]] gaining a majority in [[East Pakistan]] (current day Bangladesh).\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited [[Nurul Amin]] of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], and also appointed him as the first [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice President]]. The growing instigated violence against [[Pakistanis]] in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use [[Operation Searchlight|force]] in order to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|order]] there, which further escalated [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bengali resistance]] (1970).  [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Preemptive strikes]] against [[India]] led to another [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war]] in 1971, which [[Independence of Bangladesh|freed]] [[East Pakistan]] and created [[Bangladesh]].\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of [[Pakistan]] after the [[Fall of Dhaka|fall]] of [[East Pakistan]], President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. President Bhutto created the current [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1973, transforming [[Pakistan]] into a [[parliamentary democracy]], and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]].\n\n===Past Interventions===\nThe [[1977 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|right-wing]] alliance, the [[Pakistan National Alliance]]. The events leading to it resulted in [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]]. Suspending the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] in 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's [[Zia regime|presidency]] oversaw the modern growth of [[Islamic fundamentalism|far-right ideas]] in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] held a [[1984 Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum|referendum]] (1984) and called for [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1985. President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] appointed [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Mohammad Junejo]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and assumed more [[Political power|powers]] through the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]]. After dismissing [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Junejo]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] announced that new [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] would be held, but President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|died in a plane crash]] in 1988.\n\nThe [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1988 witnessed the victory of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] in 1988, and appointed [[Chairman Senate]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] to the presidency. Conflict between [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] repeatedly intervened in government matters and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|leveled charges]] against [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]; thus [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1990. After holding [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1990, [[Nawaz Sharif]] brought up an ideologically [[First Sharif ministry|conservative government]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Allam]], President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] tendered resignations in 1993.\n\nFollowing the [[1993 Pakistani general election|new elections]] held in 1993, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] established a strong government after appointing loyalist [[Farooq Leghari]] to the presidency. However, the [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corruption charges]] and the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]] in 1996 resulted in President [[Farooq Leghari]] [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In 1997, President [[Farooq Leghari]] could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] by the public in [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997]].  President [[Farooq Leghari|Leghari]] unsuccessfully supported [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]]\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Executive]], and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. After appointing [[Rafiq Tarar]], the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] successfully passed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|self coup]] in 1999, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and President [[Rafiq Tarar]] in 2001 while assuming more [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|powers to the presidency]].  In January 2004, the [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] [[2004 Pakistani presidential election|elected]] Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Amy|title=Pakistan Gives Musharraf Confidence Vote as President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515004758/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|archivedate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary,]] and declared a [[2007 Pakistani martial law|state of emergency]] in 2007, after dismissing the [[List of Justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].

National selectors in Switzerland though overlooked him and did not chose him to represent [[Switzerland at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|Switzerland at the 2008 Games]].  Despite being the top ranked sportsperson in his event, he was passed over with two lower ranked athletes chosen instead.  With unclear explanations as to why Gobe was overlooked, following the Beijing Games, he contacted the Cameroon National Paralympic Committee about potentially representing Cameroon in international competitions.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nGobe was selected to represent [[Cameroon at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]], but issues with nationality meant he could not compete.  This situation was not made clear until shortly before the start of the London Games.  Gobe had taken Swiss citizenship in order to represent [[Switzerland men's national wheelchair basketball team|Switzerland in wheelchair basketball]].  Cameroon does not allow dual nationality, and gaining Swiss nationality nullified his Cameroon passport.  The lack of a Cameroon passport meant he could not represent Cameroon in London.

National selectors in Switzerland though overlooked him and did not chose him to represent [[Switzerland at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|Switzerland at the 2008 Games]].  Despite being the top ranked sportsperson in his event, he was passed over with two lower ranked athletes chosen instead.  With unclear explanations as to why Gobe was overlooked, following the Beijing Games, he contacted the Cameroon National Paralympic Committee about potentially representing Cameroon in international competitions.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nGobe was selected to represent [[Cameroon at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]], but issues with nationality meant he could not compete.  This situation was not made clear until shortly before the start of the London Games.  Gobe had taken Swiss citizenship in order to represent [[Switzerland men's national wheelchair basketball team|Switzerland in wheelchair basketball]].  Cameroon does not allow dual nationality, and gaining Swiss nationality nullified his Cameroon passport.  The lack of a Cameroon passport meant he could not represent Cameroon in London.

He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R. Chopra]] over the production of the series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' based on [[Mahabharata|another epic of the same name]], and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=S.

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R.

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!
