These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most [[tropical cyclones]] form in the Atlantic basin. It was a slightly below average season, with 10 tropical cyclones developing and reaching tropical storm intensity. Four of the storms strengthened into hurricanes. One system reached major hurricane intensity &ndash; Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale]]. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed during the month of June in the Pacific Ocean, while located south of [[Guatemala]]. The storm moved northward across [[Central America]], but caused no known impact in the region. It struck the [[Florida Panhandle]] and caused minor impact across much of the [[Southern United States]]. [[Tropical cyclogenesis]] halted for over two months, until Anna formed on August&nbsp;21. The storm remained well away from land in the far North Atlantic Ocean and caused no impact.\n\n[[Hurricane Betsy]] was the strongest and most devastating storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was reported in [[the Bahamas]], Florida, and [[Louisiana]], particularly the [[New Orleans]] area. It was the first hurricane in the history of the United States to result in at least $1&nbsp;billion (1965&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, [[Tropical Storm Debbie (1965)|Tropical Storm Debbie]] developed in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October&nbsp;12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965&nbsp;Atlantic hurricane season caused 76&nbsp;fatalities and $1.45&nbsp;billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/06/1965 till:31/12/1965\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1965\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_&lt;39_mph_(0\u201362_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117 km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(119\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013130_mph_(178\u2013209-km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_131\u2013155_mph_(210\u2013249_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_&gt;=156_mph_(&gt;=250_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:11/06/1965 till:15/06/1965 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:21/08/1965 till:28/08/1965 color:C2 text:\"Anna (C2)\"\n  from:27/08/1965 till:12/09/1965 color:C4 text:\"[[Hurricane Betsy|Betsy]] (C4)\"\n  from:07/09/1965 till:09/09/1965 color:TS text:\"Four (TS)\"\n  from:16/09/1965 till:01/10/1965 color:C1 text:\"Carol (C1)\"\n  from:24/09/1965 till:30/09/1965 color:TS text:\"[[Tropical Storm Debbie (1965)|Debbie]] (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/1965 till:03/10/1965 color:TS text:\"Seven (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:15/10/1965 till:18/10/1965 color:C2 text:\"Elena (C2)\"\n  from:16/10/1965 till:19/10/1965 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:29/11/1965 till:02/12/1965 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/06/1965 till:01/07/1965 text:June\n  from:01/07/1965 till:01/08/1965 text:July\n  from:01/08/1965 till:01/09/1965 text:August\n  from:01/09/1965 till:01/10/1965 text:September\n  from:01/10/1965 till:01/11/1965 text:October\n  from:01/11/1965 till:01/12/1965 text:November\n  from:01/12/1965 till:31/12/1965 text:December\n\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(617,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1965.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most [[tropical cyclones]] form in the Atlantic basin. It was a slightly below average season, with 10 tropical cyclones developing and reaching tropical storm intensity. Four of the storms strengthened into hurricanes. One system reached major hurricane intensity &ndash; Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale]]. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed during the month of June in the Pacific Ocean, while located south of [[Guatemala]]. The storm moved northward across [[Central America]], but caused no known impact in the region. It struck the [[Florida Panhandle]] and caused minor impact across much of the [[Southern United States]]. [[Tropical cyclogenesis]] halted for over two months, until Anna formed on August&nbsp;21. The storm remained well away from land in the far North Atlantic Ocean and caused no impact.\n\n[[Hurricane Betsy]] was the strongest and most devastating storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was reported in [[the Bahamas]], Florida, and [[Louisiana]], particularly the [[New Orleans]] area. It was the first hurricane in the history of the United States to result in at least $1&nbsp;billion (1965&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, [[Tropical Storm Debbie (1965)|Tropical Storm Debbie]] developed in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October&nbsp;12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965&nbsp;Atlantic hurricane season caused 76&nbsp;fatalities and $1.45&nbsp;billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/06/1965 till:31/12/1965\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1965\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_&lt;39_mph_(0\u201362_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117 km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(119\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013130_mph_(178\u2013209-km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_131\u2013155_mph_(210\u2013249_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_&gt;=156_mph_(&gt;=250_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:11/06/1965 till:15/06/1965 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:21/08/1965 till:28/08/1965 color:C2 text:\"Anna (C2)\"\n  from:27/08/1965 till:12/09/1965 color:C4 text:\"[[Hurricane Betsy|Betsy]] (C4)\"\n  from:07/09/1965 till:09/09/1965 color:TS text:\"Four (TS)\"\n  from:16/09/1965 till:01/10/1965 color:C1 text:\"Carol (C1)\"\n  from:24/09/1965 till:30/09/1965 color:TS text:\"[[Tropical Storm Debbie (1965)|Debbie]] (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/1965 till:03/10/1965 color:TS text:\"Seven (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:15/10/1965 till:18/10/1965 color:C2 text:\"Elena (C2)\"\n  from:16/10/1965 till:19/10/1965 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:29/11/1965 till:02/12/1965 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/06/1965 till:01/07/1965 text:June\n  from:01/07/1965 till:01/08/1965 text:July\n  from:01/08/1965 till:01/09/1965 text:August\n  from:01/09/1965 till:01/10/1965 text:September\n  from:01/10/1965 till:01/11/1965 text:October\n  from:01/11/1965 till:01/12/1965 text:November\n  from:01/12/1965 till:31/12/1965 text:December\n\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(617,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1965.

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decides on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes <ref>{{cite web|title=Abkommen zur friedlichen Erledigung internationaler Streitf\u00e4lle|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1995185000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Internationale Gerichtshof|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1950006002|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK).\n\nStates do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.\n\nFor example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK are euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint / summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations.

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decides on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes <ref>{{cite web|title=Abkommen zur friedlichen Erledigung internationaler Streitf\u00e4lle|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1995185000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Internationale Gerichtshof|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1950006002|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK).\n\nStates do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.\n\nFor example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK are euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint / summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2).

Owned by the [[Hearst Television]] subsidiary of [[Hearst Communications]], it is the second-oldest television station to remain with the company in all of its various iterations behind [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. WISN's studios are located on North 19th Street on the west end of the [[Marquette University]] campus, and its transmitter is located at [[Parks of Milwaukee|Lincoln Park]] in the northeastern part of Milwaukee (next to the [[Weigel Broadcasting]] tower, which is used by [[CBS]] affiliate [[WDJT-TV]], channel 58, and its [[sister station]]s).\n\n==History==\n===First tenure with ABC===\nThe station first signed on the air on October 27, 1954 as '''WTVW''' (for its on-air slogan \"<u>W</u>isconsin's <u>T</u>ele<u>V</u>ision <u>W</u>indow\"). WTVW's transmitter building was built under a tent, as rain had threatened to delay construction. After the building was finished, a second tent was erected, and used for live automobile commercials, until it collapsed one day in early 1955.

The ''Journal'' also competed with the ''Sentinel'' (both of which were eventually consolidated into the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' in 1995) in broadcasting as owners of [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ radio]] (620 AM) and [[WTMJ-TV]] (channel 4), which Journal operated until April 1, 2015, when Journal and [[E.

In November 2014, the station unveiled their current logo with the call letters beneath the long-used \"12\" logo form and the ABC logo on the right side of the \"12\" number mark, the first with the ABC logo blended in for all uses, including for news and entertainment programming, and ending a long run where the station's call letters were rendered in [[Bank Gothic]] font.

The station utilizes two [[Doppler weather radar|weather radars]] as part of its \"Doppler 12 Radar Network\", using radar sites based at the [[National Weather Service]] forecast office in [[Sullivan, Wisconsin|Sullivan]], and atop [[Froedtert Hospital|Froedtert]]'s Community Memorial Hospital in [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]], which is operated by the station.\n\nLongtime anchor Jerry Taff retired in May 2005, as WISN's newscasts began to climb in the ratings. Its success stems from hiring popular local anchors and reporters released from other stations, a stronger ABC schedule, and a period of change at rival WTMJ-TV due to NBC's weaker ratings and changes in its newsroom staff. The station's biggest hire came when longtime WTMJ anchor Mike Gousha joined channel 12 in 2007, a year after he retired as WTMJ's evening news anchor in order to focus on his new position as a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?10905&userID=4126|title=Michael R.

The format was repeated in October 2010 between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican nominees for governor and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].\n\nWISN has gradually expanded its newscast schedule since 2007, and is unusual in programming hour-long newscasts, starting that year with a Sunday at 10 p.m. broadcast and for a time, an hour-long Saturday 6 p.m. newscast (the 6:30&nbsp;p.m. half-hour currently features either ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]'' or ''12 Sports Saturday''). On July 30, 2010, WISN, like most of its ABC-affiliated sister stations under Hearst did on that date, added a one-hour extension of its weekend morning newscast from 8 to 9&nbsp;a.m. On September 6, 2010, WISN expanded its weekday morning newscast a half-hour early to 4:30&nbsp;a.m., extending the program to {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.<ref>http://www.tvnewscheck.com/link/2010/08/31/44873/wisn-expands-am-newscast-to-430{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2009, the station began using full-time pillarboxing with the station logo and callsign on the respective sides of the screen for newscasts and other standard-definition programming.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720090850/http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Afterwards, the station began to slowly implement [[16:9]] graphical elements; in March 2010, WISN-TV unveiled 16:9-optimized weather alert graphics to allow programs to continue to be shown in HD rather than force a downscale to a modified [[4:3]] mode in which the program was displayed in 3:3 (to much viewer complaint over the years, especially with ABC prime time programming), with the weather warnings taking up the remainder of the screen. [[News ticker]]s and logo bugs were also later upgraded; the only HD news segments until late June 2011 aired on its newscasts the day of the Summerfest \"Big Bang\" fireworks show, usually scenic and human interest pieces, along with Milwaukee Public Television co-productions. On October 10, 2010, the station began broadcasting its newscasts in 16:9 [[widescreen]] [[standard definition television|standard definition]], with the pillarboxes being removed. Then on June 28, 2011, WISN-TV became the third station in Milwaukee (behind WTMJ-TV and WITI) to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. Footage shot in-studio is broadcast in HD, while all news video from on-remote locations was initially upconverted to widescreen standard definition for broadcast. Since 2012, the station has upgraded its mobile units and field cameras to HD as equipment has needed replacement. In May 2013, the station unveiled its first HD skycam, overlooking the downtown [[Cathedral Square Park]].\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WISN-TV expanded its 10 p.m. newscast to one hour (becoming the third Hearst-owned station with an hour-long late local newscast, along with [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]'s [[KOAT]] and [[Honolulu]]'s [[KITV]]).<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/111873334.html/ WISN-TV expands 10 p.m. news to one hour], ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'', December 14, 2010.

The station utilizes two [[Doppler weather radar|weather radars]] as part of its \"Doppler 12 Radar Network\", using radar sites based at the [[National Weather Service]] forecast office in [[Sullivan, Wisconsin|Sullivan]], and atop [[Froedtert Hospital|Froedtert]]'s Community Memorial Hospital in [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]], which is operated by the station.\n\nLongtime anchor Jerry Taff retired in May 2005, as WISN's newscasts began to climb in the ratings. Its success stems from hiring popular local anchors and reporters released from other stations, a stronger ABC schedule, and a period of change at rival WTMJ-TV due to NBC's weaker ratings and changes in its newsroom staff. The station's biggest hire came when longtime WTMJ anchor Mike Gousha joined channel 12 in 2007, a year after he retired as WTMJ's evening news anchor in order to focus on his new position as a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?10905&userID=4126|title=Michael R.

The format was repeated in October 2010 between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican nominees for governor and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].\n\nWISN has gradually expanded its newscast schedule since 2007, and is unusual in programming hour-long newscasts, starting that year with a Sunday at 10 p.m. broadcast and for a time, an hour-long Saturday 6 p.m. newscast (the 6:30&nbsp;p.m. half-hour currently features either ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]'' or ''12 Sports Saturday''). On July 30, 2010, WISN, like most of its ABC-affiliated sister stations under Hearst did on that date, added a one-hour extension of its weekend morning newscast from 8 to 9&nbsp;a.m. On September 6, 2010, WISN expanded its weekday morning newscast a half-hour early to 4:30&nbsp;a.m., extending the program to {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.<ref>http://www.tvnewscheck.com/link/2010/08/31/44873/wisn-expands-am-newscast-to-430{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2009, the station began using full-time pillarboxing with the station logo and callsign on the respective sides of the screen for newscasts and other standard definition programming.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720090850/http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Afterwards, the station began to slowly implement [[16:9]] graphical elements; in March 2010, WISN-TV unveiled 16:9-optimized weather alert graphics to allow programs to continue to be shown in HD rather than force a downscale to a modified [[4:3]] mode in which the program was displayed in 3:3 (to much viewer complaint over the years, especially with ABC prime time programming), with the weather warnings taking up the remainder of the screen. [[News ticker]]s and logo bugs were also later upgraded; the only HD news segments until late June 2011 aired on its newscasts the day of the Summerfest \"Big Bang\" fireworks show, usually scenic and human interest pieces, along with Milwaukee Public Television co-productions. On October 10, 2010, the station began broadcasting its newscasts in 16:9 [[widescreen]] [[standard definition television|standard definition]], with the pillarboxes being removed. Then on June 28, 2011, WISN-TV became the third station in Milwaukee (behind WTMJ-TV and WITI) to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. Footage shot in-studio is broadcast in HD, while all news video from on-remote locations was initially upconverted to widescreen standard definition for broadcast.
