Ingram]] in 1964.  It is chambered in either [[.45 ACP]] or [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]]. A two-stage suppressor by Sionics was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic (although it also made the gun far less compact and concealable).<ref>{{cite book |title=Modern Warfare |editor1-last=Dartford |editor1-first=Mark |year=1985 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Books |location=London |isbn=0-86307-325-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/modernwarfare0000unse }}</ref> For a decade, the semi-automatic pistol version of the weapon was forbidden in the U.S. under the assault weapons ban enacted by Congress in 1994.\n\n==Design==\nThe M10 was built predominantly from steel stampings.  A notched cocking handle protrudes from the top of the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]], and by turning the handle 90\u00b0 would lock the bolt, and act as an indicator the weapon is unable to fire. The M10 has a [[telescoping bolt]], which wraps around the rear face of the barrel. This allows a more compact weapon and balances the weight of the weapon over the pistol grip, where the magazine is located. The M10 fires from an [[open bolt]], and the light weight of the bolt results in a rapid rate of fire. In addition, this design incorporates a built in feed ramp as part of the trigger guard (a new concept at the time) and to save on cost the magazine was recycled from the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Gun]]. The barrel is threaded to accept a [[suppressor]], which worked by reducing the discharge's sound, without attempting to reduce the velocity of the [[bullet]]. This worked well with the .45 ACP versions, as most loads are subsonic already, as opposed to special, low-powered subsonic loads usually required for suppressed 9mm weapons. At the suggestion of the [[United States Army]], the suppressor also acted as a foregrip to inhibit muzzle rise when fired. Ingram added a small bracket with a small strap beneath the muzzle to aid in controlling recoil during [[fully automatic]] fire. The original rate of fire for the M10 in .45 ACP is approximately 1090 rounds per minute. That of the 9mm is approximately 1250 rounds per minute, and that of the smaller [[MAC-11]] in [[.380 ACP]] is 1380 rounds per minute.<ref name=\"McNab2011\">{{cite book|last=McNab|first=Chris|title=The Uzi Submachine Gun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWbTl02k5jYC&pg=PA69|date=20 November 2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-906-7|page=69}}</ref>\n\nNoting the weapon's poor precision, in the 1970s International Association of Police Chiefs weapons researcher David Steele described the MAC series as \"fit only for combat in a phone booth\".<ref name=\"Lewis2011\">{{cite book|author=Jack Lewis|title=Assault Weapons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2AbzqChZBYC&pg=PA79|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=1-4402-2400-5|pages=79\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== Suppressor ==\nThe primary reason for the original M10 finding recognition was its revolutionary sound [[suppressor]] designed by [[Mitchell WerBell III]] of [[Sionics]]. This suppressor had a two-stage design, with the first stage being larger than the second.  This uniquely shaped suppressor gave the MAC-10 a very distinctive look. It was also very quiet, to the point that the bolt could be heard cycling, along with the suppressed report of the weapon's discharge; however, only if subsonic rounds were used (standard .45 ACP rounds are subsonic). The suppressor when used with a Nomex cover created a place to hold the firearm with the secondary hand, making it easier to control. During the 1970s the United States placed restrictions on the export of suppressors, and a number of countries canceled their orders as the effectiveness of the MAC-10's suppressor was one of its main selling points.  This was one factor that led to the bankruptcy of Military Armament Corporation, another being the company's failure to recognize the private market. The original Sionics suppressor is 11.44&nbsp;inches in length, 2.13&nbsp;inches in overall diameter, and weighs 1.20 pounds.<ref name=\"Walker2012\">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Robert E.|title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJYjP_tJ9_wC&pg=PA210|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-0206-2|pages=210, 436}}</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe term \"MAC-10\" is commonly used in unofficial parlance.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Military Armament Corporation never used the nomenclature MAC-10 on any of its catalogs or sales literature, but because \"MAC-10\" became so frequently used by [[Title II weapons|Title II]] dealers, gun writers, and collectors, it is used more frequently than \"M10\" to identify the gun.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Shooting demonstration of sound suppressed Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol by US marshal.jpg|thumb|upright|Firing the suppressed Ingram MAC 10]]\n\n== Calibers and variants ==\nWhile the original M10 was available chambered for either .45 [[Automatic Colt Pistol|ACP]] or 9mm, the M10 is part of a series of machine pistols, the others being: the [[MAC-11]]/ M-11A1, which is a scaled-down version of the M10 chambered in [[.380 ACP]] (9x17mm); and the M-11/9, which is a modified version of the M-11 with a longer receiver chambered in 9x19mm, later made by SWD (Sylvia and Wayne Daniel), [[Cobray Company|Leinad]] and Vulcan Armament.\n\nIn the United States, machine guns are [[National Firearms Act]] items. As the Military Armament Corporation was in bankruptcy, a large number of incomplete sheet metal frame flats were given serial numbers and then bought by a new company, RPB Industries. Some of the previously completed guns which were already stamped with MAC, were then stamped with RPB on the reverse side, making it a \"double stamp\" gun.\n\nRPB Industries made many open-bolt semi-automatic and sub-machine guns before the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) seized roughly 200 open bolt semi-autos during the drug wars of 1981. The BATFE insisted that all future semiautomatic firearms were to be manufactured with a closed-bolt design as the open-bolt semi-automatics were considered too easy to illegally convert to full automatic operation.<ref name=\"Walker2012\"/>\n\nWayne Daniel, a former RPB machine operator, purchased much of their remaining inventory and formed SWD, designing a new weapon which was more balanced, available either fully or semi-automatic with his new BATFE-approved closed bolt design.<ref name=\"Larson2011\">{{cite book|last=Larson|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Larson (author)|title=Lethal Passage: The Story of a Gun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzV82AD3GlQC&pg=PA253|date=27 July 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-80331-3|page=253}}</ref>\n\nThere are several carbine versions of the M-11/9 and Cobray and SWD manufactured a smaller version chambered in .380 ACP as a semiautomatic pistol called the M-12.<ref name=\"Shideler2011\">{{cite book|last=Shideler|first=Dan|title=Gun Digest 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HEjWeu2XJlEC&pg=PA54|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1447-6|page=54}}</ref>\n\nToday, while the civilian manufacture, sale and possession of post-1986 select-fire MAC-10 and variants is prohibited, it is still legal to sell templates, tooling and manuals to complete such conversions.

The MAC-10 was named directly in the ban,<ref name=\"clintongunban.com\">http://clintongunban.com/FactSheets.aspx?i=80&a=Fact%20Sheet</ref> and it failed three of the requirements: \n#A semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm,\n#A manufactured weight of 50 ounces (1.4&nbsp;kg) or more when the pistol is unloaded.<ref name=\"clintongunban.com\"/> The MAC-10 weighed 100.16 oz (2.84&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"Spitzer2001\">{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Robert J.|title=The Right to Bear Arms: Rights and Liberties Under the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYKrIwceQ1UC&pg=PA96|date=1 January 2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-347-6|pages=96\u201397}}</ref>, and\n#A threaded barrel to attach barrel extender, flash suppressor, handgrip, or suppressor\n\nAdditionally, the magazine capacity was 32 rounds. In response, Wayne Daniel redesigned the M-11 by eliminating the threaded barrel and creating a new magazine release that would only allow the firearm to accept a new 10-round magazine as the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban mandated.

Ingram]] in 1964.  It is chambered in either [[.45 ACP]] or [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]]. A two-stage suppressor by Sionics was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic (although it also made the gun far less compact and concealable).<ref>{{cite book |title=Modern Warfare |editor1-last=Dartford |editor1-first=Mark |year=1985 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Books |location=London |isbn=0-86307-325-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/modernwarfare0000unse }}</ref> For a decade, the semi-automatic pistol version of the weapon was forbidden in the U.S. under the assault weapons ban enacted by Congress in 1994.\n\n==Design==\nThe M10 was built predominantly from steel stampings.  A notched cocking handle protrudes from the top of the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]], and by turning the handle 90\u00b0 would lock the bolt, and act as an indicator the weapon is unable to fire. The M10 has a [[telescoping bolt]], which wraps around the rear face of the barrel. This allows a more compact weapon and balances the weight of the weapon over the pistol grip, where the magazine is located. The M10 fires from an [[open bolt]], and the light weight of the bolt results in a rapid rate of fire. In addition, this design incorporates a built in feed ramp as part of the trigger guard (a new concept at the time) and to save on cost the magazine was recycled from the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Gun]]. The barrel is threaded to accept a [[suppressor]], which worked by reducing the discharge's sound, without attempting to reduce the velocity of the [[bullet]]. This worked well with the .45 ACP versions, as most loads are subsonic already, as opposed to special, low-powered subsonic loads usually required for suppressed 9mm weapons. At the suggestion of the [[United States Army]], the suppressor also acted as a foregrip to inhibit muzzle rise when fired. Ingram added a small bracket with a small strap beneath the muzzle to aid in controlling recoil during [[fully automatic]] fire. The original rate of fire for the M10 in .45 ACP is approximately 1090 rounds per minute. That of the 9mm is approximately 1250 rounds per minute, and that of the smaller [[MAC-11]] in [[.380 ACP]] is 1380 rounds per minute.<ref name=\"McNab2011\">{{cite book|last=McNab|first=Chris|title=The Uzi Submachine Gun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWbTl02k5jYC&pg=PA69|date=20 November 2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-906-7|page=69}}</ref>\n\nNoting the weapon's poor precision, in the 1970s International Association of Police Chiefs weapons researcher David Steele described the MAC series as \"fit only for combat in a phone booth\".<ref name=\"Lewis2011\">{{cite book|author=Jack Lewis|title=Assault Weapons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2AbzqChZBYC&pg=PA79|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=1-4402-2400-5|pages=79\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== Suppressor ==\nThe primary reason for the original M10 finding recognition was its revolutionary sound [[suppressor]] designed by [[Mitchell WerBell III]] of [[Sionics]]. This suppressor had a two-stage design, with the first stage being larger than the second.  This uniquely shaped suppressor gave the MAC-10 a very distinctive look. It was also very quiet, to the point that the bolt could be heard cycling, along with the suppressed report of the weapon's discharge; however, only if subsonic rounds were used (standard .45 ACP rounds are subsonic). The suppressor when used with a Nomex cover created a place to hold the firearm with the secondary hand, making it easier to control. During the 1970s the United States placed restrictions on the export of suppressors, and a number of countries canceled their orders as the effectiveness of the MAC-10's suppressor was one of its main selling points.  This was one factor that led to the bankruptcy of Military Armament Corporation, another being the company's failure to recognize the private market. The original Sionics suppressor is 11.44&nbsp;inches in length, 2.13&nbsp;inches in overall diameter, and weighs 1.20 pounds.<ref name=\"Walker2012\">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Robert E.|title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJYjP_tJ9_wC&pg=PA210|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-0206-2|pages=210, 436}}</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe term \"MAC-10\" is commonly used in unofficial parlance.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Military Armament Corporation never used the nomenclature MAC-10 on any of its catalogs or sales literature, but because \"MAC-10\" became so frequently used by [[Title II weapons|Title II]] dealers, gun writers, and collectors, it is used more frequently than \"M10\" to identify the gun.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Shooting demonstration of sound suppressed Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol by US marshal.jpg|thumb|upright|Firing the suppressed Ingram MAC 10]]\n\n== Calibers and variants ==\nWhile the original M10 was available chambered for either .45 [[Automatic Colt Pistol|ACP]] or 9mm, the M10 is part of a series of machine pistols, the others being: the [[MAC-11]]/ M-11A1, which is a scaled-down version of the M10 chambered in [[.380 ACP]] (9x17mm); and the M-11/9, which is a modified version of the M-11 with a longer receiver chambered in 9x19mm, later made by SWD (Sylvia and Wayne Daniel), [[Cobray Company|Leinad]] and Vulcan Armament.\n\nIn the United States, machine guns are [[National Firearms Act]] items. As the Military Armament Corporation was in bankruptcy, a large number of incomplete sheet metal frame flats were given serial numbers and then bought by a new company, RPB Industries. Some of the previously completed guns which were already stamped with MAC, were then stamped with RPB on the reverse side, making it a \"double stamp\" gun.\n\nRPB Industries made many open-bolt semi-automatic and sub-machine guns before the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) seized roughly 200 open bolt semi-autos during the drug wars of 1981. The BATFE insisted that all future semiautomatic firearms were to be manufactured with a closed-bolt design as the open-bolt semi-automatics were considered too easy to illegally convert to full automatic operation.<ref name=\"Walker2012\"/>\n\nWayne Daniel, a former RPB machine operator, purchased much of their remaining inventory and formed SWD, designing a new weapon which was more balanced, available either fully or semi-automatic with his new BATFE-approved closed bolt design.<ref name=\"Larson2011\">{{cite book|last=Larson|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Larson (author)|title=Lethal Passage: The Story of a Gun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzV82AD3GlQC&pg=PA253|date=27 July 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-80331-3|page=253}}</ref>\n\nThere are several carbine versions of the M-11/9 and Cobray and SWD manufactured a smaller version chambered in .380 ACP as a semiautomatic pistol called the M-12.<ref name=\"Shideler2011\">{{cite book|last=Shideler|first=Dan|title=Gun Digest 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HEjWeu2XJlEC&pg=PA54|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1447-6|page=54}}</ref>\n\nToday, while the civilian manufacture, sale and possession of post-1986 select-fire MAC-10 and variants is prohibited, it is still legal to sell templates, tooling and manuals to complete such conversions.

The ban enacted various requirements that defined an assault weapon. The MAC-10 was named directly in the ban,<ref name=\"clintongunban.com\">http://clintongunban.com/FactSheets.aspx?i=80&a=Fact%20Sheet</ref> and it failed three of the requirements: \n#A semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm,\n#A manufactured weight of 50 ounces (1.4&nbsp;kg) or more when the pistol is unloaded.<ref name=\"clintongunban.com\"/> The MAC-10 weighed 100.16 oz (2.84&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"Spitzer2001\">{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Robert J.|title=The Right to Bear Arms: Rights and Liberties Under the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYKrIwceQ1UC&pg=PA96|date=1 January 2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-347-6|pages=96\u201397}}</ref>, and\n#A Threaded barrel to attach barrel extender, flash suppressor, handgrip, or suppressor\n\nAdditionally, the magazine capacity was 32 rounds. In response, Wayne Daniel redesigned the M-11 by eliminating the threaded barrel and creating a new magazine release that would only allow the firearm to accept a new 10-round magazine as the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban mandated. The new firearm was called the PM11/9.<ref name=\"RothKoper1999\">{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Jeffrey A.|last2=Koper|first2=Christopher S.|title=Impacts of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, 1994\u201396|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pb2RAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice|page=3}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign copies and derivatives==\n\n===BXP===\nThe [[Milkor BXP|BXP]] is 9&nbsp;mm submachine gun developed in the mid-1980s by the South African company Mechem (currently a division of Denel, formerly under ARMSCOR) and brought into production in 1984. Due to international arms embargoes of Apartheid South Africa, the country was forced to design and manufacture their own weapons. The weapon was intended for use by security forces. The manufacturing rights shifted from hand to hand several times during the years, passing from Mechem to Milkor Marketing and later to Truvelo Armoury, the current manufacturer (as for 2009).\n\n===Cobra carbine===\nThe Cobra carbine is a semi-automatic firearm of Rhodesian origin manufactured during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] Era as a self-defense weapon for farmers and is chambered for the  9\u00d719mm Parabellum round.
