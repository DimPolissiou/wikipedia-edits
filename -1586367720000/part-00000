Fuxin is known as China's 'Agate City', with 50% of the nation's known deposits of the mineral being located there. The city also accounts for more than 90% of the country's agate products.\n\nThe city suffers from the over-mining of coal, which is low in supply while fundamental to Fuxin's economy.  As the coal mines run dry, Fuxin is trying to find other industries to keep its economy going. Measures taken have included the development of a part of the city as a 'Special Economic Zone', by which the city hopes to attract international investment.\n\nProblems due to the widespread shutdown of Fuxin coalmines include an increase in membership of the Fuxin Rebels, a group known for petty crimes\n\n===Foreign Investment in 2009===\n\nIn 2009, Fuxin approved 25 foreign funded enterprises and 2 joint-venture projects. The total value of the contracted funds in these investments exceeded US$143 million.  and the foreign direct investment for that year reached US$64.12 million, up 24% over the previous year. This sum exceeded the Liaoning provincial target for foreign investment by 17%.  In addition, in 7 of the projects, contracted funds were in excess of ten million dollars.\n\n[[Foreign Direct Investment]] has enabled the development of new key industries to replace mining. The key industries have made new breakthroughs in foreign direct investment. The Wind Power Industry, which accounted for more than 70% of the total amount of FDI in 2009, has become the main focus of the whole city\u2019s FDI.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Investment in 2009|url=http://english.fuxin.gov.cn/center01/basicF/dP/fI/2010/05/26/111692.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714121501/http://english.fuxin.gov.cn/center01/basicF/dP/fI/2010/05/26/111692.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2012|publisher=Fuxin, China|date=26 May 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n*[[Liaoning Technical University]]\n* Fuxin College\n\n==Transportation==\n\nFuxin is served by the [[China National Highway 101]], which connects [[Beijing]] to Shenyang.

Fuxin is known as China's 'Agate City', with 50% of the nation's known deposits of the mineral being located there. The city also accounts for more than 90% of the country's agate products.\n\nThe city suffers from the over-mining of coal, which is low in supply while fundamental to Fuxin's economy.  As the coal mines run dry, Fuxin is trying to find other industries to keep its economy going. Measures taken have included the development of a part of the city as a 'Special Economic Zone', by which the city hopes to attract international investment.\n\nProblems due to the widespread shutdown of Fuxin coalmines include an increase in membership of the Fuxin Rebels, a group known for petty crimes\n\n===Foreign Investment in 2009===\n\nIn 2009, Fuxin approved 25 foreign funded enterprises and 2 joint-venture projects. The total value of the contracted funds in these investments exceeded US\uff04143 million.  and the foreign direct investment for that year reached US\uff0464.12 million, up 24% over the previous year. This sum exceeded the Liaoning provincial target for foreign investment by 17%.  In addition, in 7 of the projects, contracted funds were in excess of ten million dollars.\n\n[[Foreign Direct Investment]] has enabled the development of new key industries to replace mining. The key industries have made new breakthroughs in foreign direct investment. The Wind Power Industry, which accounted for more than 70% of the total amount of FDI in 2009, has become the main focus of the whole city\u2019s FDI.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Investment in 2009|url=http://english.fuxin.gov.cn/center01/basicF/dP/fI/2010/05/26/111692.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714121501/http://english.fuxin.gov.cn/center01/basicF/dP/fI/2010/05/26/111692.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2012|publisher=Fuxin, China|date=26 May 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n*[[Liaoning Technical University]]\n* Fuxin College\n\n==Transportation==\n\nFuxin is served by the [[China National Highway 101]], which connects [[Beijing]] to Shenyang.

It is [[endemic]] to six of the [[Visayan Islands]] ([[Cebu]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], [[Panay]], [[Masbate]], [[Guimaras]], and [[Siquijor]]) in the central [[Philippines]]. It is known by many names in the region (depending on the island and linguistic group) with most translating into 'wild pig': ''baboy ihalas'' ('wild pig' in Cebuano and Hiligaynon), ''baboy talonon'' ('forest pig' in Hiligaynon), and ''baboy sulop'' ('dark pig' in Cebuano)\n\nThe Visayan warty pig is critically endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. It is believed to be extinct in four of the islands in its original native range, with only small surviving populations in [[Negros Island|Negros]] and [[Panay]]. Due to the small numbers of remaining Visayan warty pigs in the wild, little is known of their behaviors or characteristics outside of captivity.

At the age of 16, Greg moved to [[San Diego]] where he lived with his older cousin David Long who surfed with Greg and helped progress his skills. Greg surfed the waves at [[Trestles, California]] at an early age and was highly regarded throughout the community as an up-and-coming star.{{cn|date=May 2016}} At 17, Greg won the NSSA National Men's Open Title in 2001, and looked to have a promising career in competitive surfing.

After surfing Todos for a couple years, Long took his big wave act to spots such as [[Mavericks, California|Mavericks]], in Northern California, and Dungeon's, in [[Cape Town, South Africa]]. He won the Red Bull Big Wave Africa at Dungeon's in 2003 at age 19.
