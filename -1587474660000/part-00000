He reigned from 1146 to 1174.\n\nHe was a Turkish warlord, an early champion of Islam.\n\n'''Minbar of Nour Ad-Din Zengi / Nour Ad-Din Zinki\u2019s Pulpit''' \n\nNour Ad-Din Zinki prepared a pulpit in 1168 to be placed inside Al-Aqsa Mosque after liberation from the Crusaders. However, it was completed after his death. Then, when Salahaddin liberated Islamicjerusalem, he shipped this pulpit from Aleppo and placed it in Al-Qibly Mosque in 1187. The pulpit is made of cedar wood which is decorated with ivory and sea shells. It has a gate that is topped with a magnificent crown believed to be the slogan of the Tankaziyah State, most probably added to its structure by Governor Tankz An-Nasiri in 1330. This pulpit also has a staircase that is topped with an arch and a wooden porch. \n\nIn 1969, Dennis Michael Rohan, an Australian Christian Zionist, set Al-Qibly Mosque on fire; the historical pulpit was destroyed completely. It was temporarily replaced with a simpler one until an identical pulpit was built in Jordan using the same original materials, which was brought to Islamicjerusalem in 2007 to be placed inside Al-Qibly Mosque. \n\n==War against Crusaders==\n\nNur ad-Din was the second son of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], the Turkish ''[[atabeg]]'' of [[Aleppo]] and [[Mosul]], who was a devoted enemy of the [[crusade]]r presence in Syria. After the assassination of his father in 1146, Nur ad-Din and his older brother [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] divided the kingdom between themselves, with Nur ad-Din governing [[Aleppo]] and Saif ad-Din Ghazi establishing himself in [[Mosul]]. The border between the two new kingdoms was formed by the Nahr al-Khabur River. Almost as soon as he began his rule, Nur ad-Din attacked the [[Principality of Antioch]], seizing several castles in the north of Syria, while at the same time he defeated an attempt by [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] to recover the [[County of Edessa]], which had been conquered by Zengi in 1144. (See [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Siege of Edessa]].) In 1146, after the Frankish attempt to reoccupy Edessa, Nur ad-Din massacred the local [[Armenians|Armenian]] Christian population of the city and destroyed its fortifications,{{efn|A Frankish attempt to take advantage of the situation by reoccupying Edessa in November 1146, led by Joscelin II and Baldwin of Marasch, failed utterly, the count fleeing ignominiously, Baldwin meeting a heroic death,  the city's walls being levelled and the local Armenian Christians suffering the massacre they had avoided two years earlier.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=268}}}}{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=268}} in punishment for assisting Joscelin in this attempt. According to [[Thomas Asbridge]], the women and children of Edessa were enslaved.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=1140}} He secured his hold on Antioch after crushing [[Raymond of Poitiers]] at the [[Battle of Inab]] in 1149, even presenting to the caliph, Raymond's severed head and arms.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=195}}\n\nNur ad-Din sought to make alliances with his Muslim neighbours in northern [[Iraq]] and Syria in order to strengthen the Muslim front against their Crusader enemies. In 1147 he signed a bilateral treaty with [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], governor of [[Damascus]]. As part of this agreement, he also married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter [[Ismat ad-Din Khatun]]. Together Mu'in ad-Din and Nur ad-Din besieged the cities of [[Bozrah|Bosra]] (see [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Battle of Bosra]]) and Salkhad, which had been captured by a rebellious vassal of Mu'in ad-Din named Altuntash, but Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's intentions and did not want to offend his former crusader allies in [[Jerusalem]], who had helped defend Damascus against Zengi. To reassure Mu'in ad-Din, Nur ad-Din curtailed his stay in Damascus and turned instead towards the Principality of Antioch, where he was able to seize [[Artah]], [[Kafr Latah|Kafar Latha]], Basarfut, and Balat.\n\nIn 1148, the [[Second Crusade]] arrived in Syria, led by [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]]. Nur ad-Din's victories and the Crusader's losses in Asia Minor however had made the recovery of Edessa \u2013 their original goal \u2013 practically impossible. Given that Aleppo was too far off from Jerusalem for an attack and Damascus, recently allied with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] against Zengi, had entered into an alliance with Nur ad-Din, the Crusaders decided to attack Damascus, the conquest of which would preclude a combination of Jerusalem's enemies. Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly called for help from Nur ad-Din, but the [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|crusader siege]] collapsed after only four days.\n\nNur ad-Din took advantage of the failure of the Crusade to prepare another attack against Antioch. In 1149, he launched an offensive against the territories dominated by the castle of Harim, situated on the eastern bank of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]], after which he besieged the castle of [[Inab]]. The Prince of Antioch, [[Raymond of Poitiers]], quickly came to the aid of the besieged citadel. The Muslim army destroyed the Crusader army at the [[Battle of Inab]], during which Raymond was killed. Raymond's head was sent to Nur ad-Din, who sent it along to the [[Caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]. Nur ad-Din marched all the way to the coast and expressed his dominance of Syria by symbolically bathing in the Mediterranean. He did not, however, attack Antioch itself; he was content with capturing all Antiochene territory east of the Orontes and leaving a rump state around the city, which in any case soon fell under the suzerainty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 1150, he defeated Joscelin II for a final time, after allying with the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of R\u00fcm]], [[Mas'ud of R\u00fcm|Mas'ud]] (whose daughter he also married). Joscelin was blinded and died in his prison in Aleppo in 1159. In the [[Battle of Aintab]], Nur ad-Din tried but failed to prevent King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]'s evacuation of the Latin Christian residents of [[Turbessel]]. In 1152 Nur ad-Din captured and burned [[Tartus|Tortosa]],{{sfn|Barber|1994|p=81}} briefly occupying the town.\n\n==Unification of sultanate==\n[[File:Zengid_Dynasty_1127_-_1250_(AD).PNG|thumb|250px|Map of Zengid Sultanate dominion]]\nIt was Nur ad-Din's dream to unite the various Muslim forces between the [[Euphrates]] and the [[Nile]] to make a common front against the crusaders. In 1149 Saif ad-Din Ghazi died, and a younger brother, [[Qutb ad-Din Mawdud]], succeeded him. Qutb ad-Din recognized Nur ad-Din as overlord of Mosul, so that the major cities of Mosul and Aleppo were united under one man. Damascus was all that remained as an obstacle to the unification of Syria.\n\nAfter the failure of the Second Crusade, Mu'in ad-Din had renewed his treaty with the crusaders, and after his death in 1149 his successor [[Mujir ad-Din]] followed the same policy. In 1150 and 1151 Nur ad-Din besieged the city, but retreated each time with no success, aside from empty recognition of his suzerainty. When [[Siege of Ascalon|Ascalon was captured]] by the crusaders in 1153, Mujir ad-Din forbade Nur ad-Din from travelling across his territory. Mujir ad-Din, however, was a weaker ruler than his predecessor, and he also agreed to pay an annual tribute to the crusaders in exchange for their protection. The growing weakness of Damascus under Mujir ad-Din allowed Nur ad-Din to overthrow him in 1154, with help from the population of the city. Damascus was annexed to Zengid territory, and all of Syria was unified under the authority of Nur ad-Din, from [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in the north to the [[Hauran]] in the south. He was cautious not to attack Jerusalem right away, and even continued to send the yearly tribute established by Mujir ad-Din; meanwhile he briefly became involved in affairs to the north of Mosul, where a succession dispute in the Sultanate of Rum threatened Edessa and other cities.\n\nIn 1157 Nur ad-Din besieged the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in the crusader fortress of [[Banias]], routed a relief army from Jerusalem led by King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], and captured [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Bertrand de Blanquefort]]. However, he fell ill that year and the crusaders were given a brief respite from his attacks. In 1159 the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] arrived to assert his authority in Antioch, and the crusaders hoped he would send an expedition against Aleppo. However, Nur ad-Din sent ambassadors and negotiated an alliance with the emperor against the Seljuks, much to the crusaders' dismay. Nur ad-Din, along with the [[Danishmends]] of eastern [[Anatolia]], attacked the Seljuk sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]] from the east the next year, while Manuel attacked from the west. Later in 1160, Nur ad-Din captured the Prince of Antioch, [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] after a raid in the Anti-Taurus mountains; Raynald remained in captivity for the next sixteen years. By 1162, with Antioch under nominal Byzantine control and the crusader states further south powerless to make any further attacks on Syria, Nur ad-Din made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. Soon after he returned, he learned of the death of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], and out of respect for such a formidable opponent he refrained from attacking the crusader kingdom: [[William of Tyre]] reports that Nur ad-Din said \"We should sympathize with their grief and in pity spare them, because they have lost a prince such as the rest of the world does not possess today.\"\n\n===The problem of Egypt===\n{{main|Crusader invasion of Egypt}}\nAs there was now nothing the crusaders could do in Syria, they were forced to look to the south if they wanted to expand their territory. The capture of Ascalon had already succeeded in cutting off Egypt from Syria, and Egypt had been politically weakened by a series of very young [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]s. By 1163, the caliph was the young [[al-Adid]], but the country was ruled by the vizier [[Shawar]]. That year, Shawar was overthrown by [[Dirgham]]; soon afterwards, the [[King of Jerusalem]], [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], led an offensive against Egypt, on the pretext that the Fatimids were not paying the tribute they had promised to pay during the reign of Baldwin III. This campaign failed and he was forced to return to [[Jerusalem]], but it provoked Nur ad-Din to lead a campaign of his own against the crusaders in Syria in order to turn their attention away from Egypt. His attack on Tripoli was unsuccessful, but he was soon visited by the exiled Shawar, who begged him to send an army and restore him to the vizierate. Nur ad-Din did not want to spare his own army for a defense of Egypt, but his [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general [[Shirkuh]] convinced him to invade in 1164. In response, Dirgham allied with Amalric, but the king could not mobilize in time to save him. Dirgham was killed during Shirkuh's invasion and Shawar was restored as vizier.\n\nShawar immediately expelled Shirkuh and allied with Amalric, who arrived to besiege Shirkuh at [[Bilbeis]]. Shirkuh agreed to abandon Egypt when Amalric was forced to return home, after Nur ad-Din attacked Antioch and [[Battle of Harim|besieged the castle of Harenc]]. There, Nur ad-Din routed the combined armies of Antioch and Tripoli, but refused to attack Antioch itself, fearing reprisals from the Byzantines. Instead he besieged and captured Banias, and for the next two years continually raided the frontiers of the crusader states. In 1166 Shirkuh was sent again to Egypt. Amalric followed him at the beginning of 1167, and a formal treaty was established between Amalric and Shawar, with the nominal support of the caliph. The crusaders occupied [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]] and made Egypt a tributary state, but Amalric could not hold the country while Nur ad-Din still held Syria, and he was forced to return to Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1168 Amalric sought an alliance with Emperor Manuel and invaded Egypt once more. Shawar's son Khalil had had enough, and with support from Caliph al-Adid requested help from Nur ad-Din and Shirkuh.  At the beginning of 1169 Shirkuh arrived and the crusaders once more were forced to retreat. This time Nur ad-Din gained full control of Egypt. Shawar was executed and Shirkuh was named vizier of the newly conquered territory, later succeeded by his nephew [[Saladin]]. One last invasion of Egypt was launched by Amalric and Manuel, but it was disorganized and came to nothing.\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:Kuppel Nur ad-Din Madrasa.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Domes of Nur al-Din Mahmud's madrasa complex in Damascus (his burial place)]]\nDuring this time Nur ad-Din was busy in the north, fighting the [[Ortoqid]]s, and in 1170 he had to settle a dispute between his nephews when his brother Qutb ad-Din died. After conquering Egypt, Nur ad-Din believed that he had accomplished his goal of uniting the Muslim states, but [[Saladin]] did not wish to be subject to his authority. He did not participate in the invasions led by Nur ad-Din against Jerusalem in 1171 and 1173, hoping that the crusader kingdom would act as a buffer state between Egypt and Syria. Nur ad-Din realized that he had created a dangerous opponent in Saladin, and the two rulers assembled their armies for what seemed to be the inevitable war.\n\nHowever, when Nur ad-Din was on the verge of invading Egypt, he was seized by a fever due to complications from a [[peritonsillar abscess]].{{sfn|Elisseeff|1995|p=132}} He died at the age of 56 on 15 May 1174 in the [[Citadel of Damascus]]. He was initially buried there, before being reburied in the [[Nur al-Din Madrasa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gabrieli|1984|p=68}}</ref> His young son [[As-Salih Ismail al-Malik]] became his legitimate heir, and [[Saladin]] declared himself his vassal,  Syria and Egypt under his own rule.  defeated the other claimants to the throne and took power in Syria in 1185, finally realizing Nur ad-Din's dream.\n\n==Legacy==\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], although Nur ad-Din was \"a mighty persecutor of the Christian name and faith,\" he was also \"a just prince, valiant and wise, and according to the traditions of his race, a religious man.\" Nur ad-Din was especially religious after his illness and his [[hajj|pilgrimage]]. He considered the crusaders foreigners in Muslim territory, who had come to [[Outremer]] to plunder the land and profane its sacred places. Nevertheless, he tolerated the Christians who lived under his authority, aside from the Armenians of Edessa, and regarded the Emperor Manuel with deep respect. In contrast to Nur ad-Din's respectful reaction to the death of Baldwin III, Amalric I immediately besieged Banias upon learning of the emir's death, and extorted a vast amount of money from his widow.\n\nDuring Nur ad-Din's reign, forty-two [[madrasa]]s were built in Syria, of which half he personally sponsored.{{sfn|Jotischky|2017|p=121}} Through the construction of these madrasas Nur ad-Din was ensuring the creation of Sunni Islamic [[qadi]]s and [[imam]]s.{{sfn|Jotischky|2017|p=121}} Nur ad-Din himself enjoyed to have specialists read to him from the Hadith, and his professors even awarded him a diploma in Hadith narration. He had [[bimaristan]]s(hospitals){{sfn|Raby|2004|p=300}} constructed in his cities as well, and built [[caravanserai]]s on the roads for travellers and pilgrims. He held court several times a week so that people could seek justice from him against his generals, governors, or other employees who had committed some crime.\n\nNur ad-Din's Sunni orthodoxy can be seen in his public works.{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=299}} His repair of the Roman aqueduct in Aleppo insinuated an anti-Shia polemic,{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=296}} and the conversion of two Shia mosques into madrasas, one [[Shafi'i]] another [[Hanafi]], reinforce his insistence of promoting Sunni Islam.{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=296-297}} Consequently, in November 1148, he forbade the Shia call to prayer in Aleppo and any public displays of [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]].{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=297}}\n\nIn the Muslim world he remains a legendary figure of military courage, piety, and modesty. Sir Steven Runciman said that he loved, above all else, justice.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=398}}\n\nThe Damascene chronicler [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] generally speaks of Nur ad-Din in majestic terms, although he himself died in 1160, and unfortunately did not witness the later events of Nur ad-Din's reign.\n\nThe [[Islamist]] group [[Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki]], active in the [[Syrian Civil War]] in [[Aleppo]] since 2011, is named after Nur ad-Din.\n\nNur ad-Din, or known as Nourn Dinh, is one of the martyrs venerated by the syncretistic Vietnamese religion of [[Cao Dai]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Asbridge |title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2012 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple |last=Barber |first=Malcolm |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Nur al-Din Mahmud b.

He reigned from 1146 to 1174.\n\nHe was a Turkish warlord, an early champion of Islam.\n\n==War against Crusaders==\n\nNur ad-Din was the second son of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], the Turkish ''[[atabeg]]'' of [[Aleppo]] and [[Mosul]], who was a devoted enemy of the [[crusade]]r presence in Syria. After the assassination of his father in 1146, Nur ad-Din and his older brother [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] divided the kingdom between themselves, with Nur ad-Din governing [[Aleppo]] and Saif ad-Din Ghazi establishing himself in [[Mosul]]. The border between the two new kingdoms was formed by the Nahr al-Khabur River. Almost as soon as he began his rule, Nur ad-Din attacked the [[Principality of Antioch]], seizing several castles in the north of Syria, while at the same time he defeated an attempt by [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] to recover the [[County of Edessa]], which had been conquered by Zengi in 1144. (See [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Siege of Edessa]].) In 1146, after the Frankish attempt to reoccupy Edessa, Nur ad-Din massacred the local [[Armenians|Armenian]] Christian population of the city and destroyed its fortifications,{{efn|A Frankish attempt to take advantage of the situation by reoccupying Edessa in November 1146, led by Joscelin II and Baldwin of Marasch, failed utterly, the count fleeing ignominiously, Baldwin meeting a heroic death,  the city's walls being levelled and the local Armenian Christians suffering the massacre they had avoided two years earlier.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=268}}}}{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=268}} in punishment for assisting Joscelin in this attempt. According to [[Thomas Asbridge]], the women and children of Edessa were enslaved.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=1140}} He secured his hold on Antioch after crushing [[Raymond of Poitiers]] at the [[Battle of Inab]] in 1149, even presenting to the caliph, Raymond's severed head and arms.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=195}}\n\nNur ad-Din sought to make alliances with his Muslim neighbours in northern [[Iraq]] and Syria in order to strengthen the Muslim front against their Crusader enemies. In 1147 he signed a bilateral treaty with [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], governor of [[Damascus]]. As part of this agreement, he also married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter [[Ismat ad-Din Khatun]]. Together Mu'in ad-Din and Nur ad-Din besieged the cities of [[Bozrah|Bosra]] (see [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Battle of Bosra]]) and Salkhad, which had been captured by a rebellious vassal of Mu'in ad-Din named Altuntash, but Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's intentions and did not want to offend his former crusader allies in [[Jerusalem]], who had helped defend Damascus against Zengi. To reassure Mu'in ad-Din, Nur ad-Din curtailed his stay in Damascus and turned instead towards the Principality of Antioch, where he was able to seize [[Artah]], [[Kafr Latah|Kafar Latha]], Basarfut, and Balat.\n\nIn 1148, the [[Second Crusade]] arrived in Syria, led by [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]]. Nur ad-Din's victories and the Crusader's losses in Asia Minor however had made the recovery of Edessa \u2013 their original goal \u2013 practically impossible. Given that Aleppo was too far off from Jerusalem for an attack and Damascus, recently allied with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] against Zengi, had entered into an alliance with Nur ad-Din, the Crusaders decided to attack Damascus, the conquest of which would preclude a combination of Jerusalem's enemies. Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly called for help from Nur ad-Din, but the [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|crusader siege]] collapsed after only four days.\n\nNur ad-Din took advantage of the failure of the Crusade to prepare another attack against Antioch. In 1149, he launched an offensive against the territories dominated by the castle of Harim, situated on the eastern bank of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]], after which he besieged the castle of [[Inab]]. The Prince of Antioch, [[Raymond of Poitiers]], quickly came to the aid of the besieged citadel. The Muslim army destroyed the Crusader army at the [[Battle of Inab]], during which Raymond was killed. Raymond's head was sent to Nur ad-Din, who sent it along to the [[Caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]. Nur ad-Din marched all the way to the coast and expressed his dominance of Syria by symbolically bathing in the Mediterranean. He did not, however, attack Antioch itself; he was content with capturing all Antiochene territory east of the Orontes and leaving a rump state around the city, which in any case soon fell under the suzerainty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 1150, he defeated Joscelin II for a final time, after allying with the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of R\u00fcm]], [[Mas'ud of R\u00fcm|Mas'ud]] (whose daughter he also married). Joscelin was blinded and died in his prison in Aleppo in 1159. In the [[Battle of Aintab]], Nur ad-Din tried but failed to prevent King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]'s evacuation of the Latin Christian residents of [[Turbessel]]. In 1152 Nur ad-Din captured and burned [[Tartus|Tortosa]],{{sfn|Barber|1994|p=81}} briefly occupying the town.\n\n==Unification of sultanate==\n[[File:Zengid_Dynasty_1127_-_1250_(AD).PNG|thumb|250px|Map of Zengid Sultanate dominion]]\nIt was Nur ad-Din's dream to unite the various Muslim forces between the [[Euphrates]] and the [[Nile]] to make a common front against the crusaders. In 1149 Saif ad-Din Ghazi died, and a younger brother, [[Qutb ad-Din Mawdud]], succeeded him. Qutb ad-Din recognized Nur ad-Din as overlord of Mosul, so that the major cities of Mosul and Aleppo were united under one man. Damascus was all that remained as an obstacle to the unification of Syria.\n\nAfter the failure of the Second Crusade, Mu'in ad-Din had renewed his treaty with the crusaders, and after his death in 1149 his successor [[Mujir ad-Din]] followed the same policy. In 1150 and 1151 Nur ad-Din besieged the city, but retreated each time with no success, aside from empty recognition of his suzerainty. When [[Siege of Ascalon|Ascalon was captured]] by the crusaders in 1153, Mujir ad-Din forbade Nur ad-Din from travelling across his territory. Mujir ad-Din, however, was a weaker ruler than his predecessor, and he also agreed to pay an annual tribute to the crusaders in exchange for their protection. The growing weakness of Damascus under Mujir ad-Din allowed Nur ad-Din to overthrow him in 1154, with help from the population of the city. Damascus was annexed to Zengid territory, and all of Syria was unified under the authority of Nur ad-Din, from [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in the north to the [[Hauran]] in the south. He was cautious not to attack Jerusalem right away, and even continued to send the yearly tribute established by Mujir ad-Din; meanwhile he briefly became involved in affairs to the north of Mosul, where a succession dispute in the Sultanate of Rum threatened Edessa and other cities.\n\nIn 1157 Nur ad-Din besieged the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in the crusader fortress of [[Banias]], routed a relief army from Jerusalem led by King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], and captured [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Bertrand de Blanquefort]]. However, he fell ill that year and the crusaders were given a brief respite from his attacks. In 1159 the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] arrived to assert his authority in Antioch, and the crusaders hoped he would send an expedition against Aleppo. However, Nur ad-Din sent ambassadors and negotiated an alliance with the emperor against the Seljuks, much to the crusaders' dismay. Nur ad-Din, along with the [[Danishmends]] of eastern [[Anatolia]], attacked the Seljuk sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]] from the east the next year, while Manuel attacked from the west. Later in 1160, Nur ad-Din captured the Prince of Antioch, [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] after a raid in the Anti-Taurus mountains; Raynald remained in captivity for the next sixteen years. By 1162, with Antioch under nominal Byzantine control and the crusader states further south powerless to make any further attacks on Syria, Nur ad-Din made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. Soon after he returned, he learned of the death of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], and out of respect for such a formidable opponent he refrained from attacking the crusader kingdom: [[William of Tyre]] reports that Nur ad-Din said \"We should sympathize with their grief and in pity spare them, because they have lost a prince such as the rest of the world does not possess today.\"\n\n===The problem of Egypt===\n{{main|Crusader invasion of Egypt}}\nAs there was now nothing the crusaders could do in Syria, they were forced to look to the south if they wanted to expand their territory. The capture of Ascalon had already succeeded in cutting off Egypt from Syria, and Egypt had been politically weakened by a series of very young [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]s. By 1163, the caliph was the young [[al-Adid]], but the country was ruled by the vizier [[Shawar]]. That year, Shawar was overthrown by [[Dirgham]]; soon afterwards, the [[King of Jerusalem]], [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], led an offensive against Egypt, on the pretext that the Fatimids were not paying the tribute they had promised to pay during the reign of Baldwin III. This campaign failed and he was forced to return to [[Jerusalem]], but it provoked Nur ad-Din to lead a campaign of his own against the crusaders in Syria in order to turn their attention away from Egypt. His attack on Tripoli was unsuccessful, but he was soon visited by the exiled Shawar, who begged him to send an army and restore him to the vizierate. Nur ad-Din did not want to spare his own army for a defense of Egypt, but his [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general [[Shirkuh]] convinced him to invade in 1164. In response, Dirgham allied with Amalric, but the king could not mobilize in time to save him. Dirgham was killed during Shirkuh's invasion and Shawar was restored as vizier.\n\nShawar immediately expelled Shirkuh and allied with Amalric, who arrived to besiege Shirkuh at [[Bilbeis]]. Shirkuh agreed to abandon Egypt when Amalric was forced to return home, after Nur ad-Din attacked Antioch and [[Battle of Harim|besieged the castle of Harenc]]. There, Nur ad-Din routed the combined armies of Antioch and Tripoli, but refused to attack Antioch itself, fearing reprisals from the Byzantines. Instead he besieged and captured Banias, and for the next two years continually raided the frontiers of the crusader states. In 1166 Shirkuh was sent again to Egypt. Amalric followed him at the beginning of 1167, and a formal treaty was established between Amalric and Shawar, with the nominal support of the caliph. The crusaders occupied [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]] and made Egypt a tributary state, but Amalric could not hold the country while Nur ad-Din still held Syria, and he was forced to return to Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1168 Amalric sought an alliance with Emperor Manuel and invaded Egypt once more. Shawar's son Khalil had had enough, and with support from Caliph al-Adid requested help from Nur ad-Din and Shirkuh.  At the beginning of 1169 Shirkuh arrived and the crusaders once more were forced to retreat. This time Nur ad-Din gained full control of Egypt. Shawar was executed and Shirkuh was named vizier of the newly conquered territory, later succeeded by his nephew [[Saladin]]. One last invasion of Egypt was launched by Amalric and Manuel, but it was disorganized and came to nothing.\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:Kuppel Nur ad-Din Madrasa.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Domes of Nur al-Din Mahmud's madrasa complex in Damascus (his burial place)]]\nDuring this time Nur ad-Din was busy in the north, fighting the [[Ortoqid]]s, and in 1170 he had to settle a dispute between his nephews when his brother Qutb ad-Din died. After conquering Egypt, Nur ad-Din believed that he had accomplished his goal of uniting the Muslim states, but [[Saladin]] did not wish to be subject to his authority. He did not participate in the invasions led by Nur ad-Din against Jerusalem in 1171 and 1173, hoping that the crusader kingdom would act as a buffer state between Egypt and Syria. Nur ad-Din realized that he had created a dangerous opponent in Saladin, and the two rulers assembled their armies for what seemed to be the inevitable war.\n\nHowever, when Nur ad-Din was on the verge of invading Egypt, he was seized by a fever due to complications from a [[peritonsillar abscess]].{{sfn|Elisseeff|1995|p=132}} He died at the age of 56 on 15 May 1174 in the [[Citadel of Damascus]]. He was initially buried there, before being reburied in the [[Nur al-Din Madrasa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gabrieli|1984|p=68}}</ref> His young son [[As-Salih Ismail al-Malik]] became his legitimate heir, and [[Saladin]] declared himself his vassal,  Syria and Egypt under his own rule.  defeated the other claimants to the throne and took power in Syria in 1185, finally realizing Nur ad-Din's dream.\n\n==Legacy==\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], although Nur ad-Din was \"a mighty persecutor of the Christian name and faith,\" he was also \"a just prince, valiant and wise, and according to the traditions of his race, a religious man.\" Nur ad-Din was especially religious after his illness and his [[hajj|pilgrimage]]. He considered the crusaders foreigners in Muslim territory, who had come to [[Outremer]] to plunder the land and profane its sacred places. Nevertheless, he tolerated the Christians who lived under his authority, aside from the Armenians of Edessa, and regarded the Emperor Manuel with deep respect. In contrast to Nur ad-Din's respectful reaction to the death of Baldwin III, Amalric I immediately besieged Banias upon learning of the emir's death, and extorted a vast amount of money from his widow.\n\nDuring Nur ad-Din's reign, forty-two [[madrasa]]s were built in Syria, of which half he personally sponsored.{{sfn|Jotischky|2017|p=121}} Through the construction of these madrasas Nur ad-Din was ensuring the creation of Sunni Islamic [[qadi]]s and [[imam]]s.{{sfn|Jotischky|2017|p=121}} Nur ad-Din himself enjoyed to have specialists read to him from the Hadith, and his professors even awarded him a diploma in Hadith narration. He had [[bimaristan]]s(hospitals){{sfn|Raby|2004|p=300}} constructed in his cities as well, and built [[caravanserai]]s on the roads for travellers and pilgrims. He held court several times a week so that people could seek justice from him against his generals, governors, or other employees who had committed some crime.\n\nNur ad-Din's Sunni orthodoxy can be seen in his public works.{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=299}} His repair of the Roman aqueduct in Aleppo insinuated an anti-Shia polemic,{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=296}} and the conversion of two Shia mosques into madrasas, one [[Shafi'i]] another [[Hanafi]], reinforce his insistence of promoting Sunni Islam.{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=296-297}} Consequently, in November 1148, he forbade the Shia call to prayer in Aleppo and any public displays of [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]].{{sfn|Raby|2004|p=297}}\n\nIn the Muslim world he remains a legendary figure of military courage, piety, and modesty. Sir Steven Runciman said that he loved, above all else, justice.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=398}}\n\nThe Damascene chronicler [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] generally speaks of Nur ad-Din in majestic terms, although he himself died in 1160, and unfortunately did not witness the later events of Nur ad-Din's reign.\n\nThe [[Islamist]] group [[Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki]], active in the [[Syrian Civil War]] in [[Aleppo]] since 2011, is named after Nur ad-Din.\n\nNur ad-Din, or known as Nourn Dinh, is one of the martyrs venerated by the syncretistic Vietnamese religion of [[Cao Dai]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Asbridge |title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2012 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple |last=Barber |first=Malcolm |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Nur al-Din Mahmud b.

The episode aired on April 20, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\nKim and Jimmy watch Lalo leave. Jimmy asks Mike for details about why Mike has been protecting him, but Mike hangs up. Jimmy tells Kim the truth about his desert trek with Mike. Kim and Jimmy check into a downtown hotel for their safety.\n\nMike tells Gus that Lalo and Nacho went to Lalo's [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] home. Gus tells Mike he has sent assassins after Lalo and suggests Nacho can help them. Lalo and Nacho arrive at Lalo's house and are warmly greeted by family and friends. Nacho receives a call telling him to open Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m.\n\nKim ignores Jimmy's request to remain at the hotel and visits the courthouse. She meets with the public defender and accepts 20 pending felony cases ''pro bono''. She tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely. Howard warns Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment and suggests Kim should stop following his lead. Kim laughs at Howard and says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself. As she leaves, Howard tells her that Chuck best understood Jimmy.\n\nLalo prepares Nacho for his first meeting with Don Eladio. At the meeting, Lalo explains that Nacho is associated with Tuco and will manage the Salamanca drug business while Lalo is in Mexico. Eladio is impressed with Nacho's plans to expand the Salamanca territory and gives his blessing.\n\nJimmy goes to Mike's house and demands that Mike explain why Mike has been aiding him. Mike reveals that Lalo will be killed that night, and Jimmy informs Kim. Kim, still angered by Howard's comments, proposes a forced resolution of the Sandpiper case by sabotaging Howard, which would enable Jimmy to receive his seven-figure share of the settlement. Jimmy counsels against it, but Kim makes use of the same finger pointing gesture Jimmy previously used to show that she is serious about undermining Howard.{{efn|This is a reversal of the roles from the final scene of the fourth season finale episode \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\", when Jimmy reveals to Kim he plans to practice law under the name \"Saul Goodman\" and gives her the same gesture as he walks off.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-recap-something-unforgivable-984335/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale Recap: Survival Skills |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-bob-odenkirk-rhea-seehorn/ |title=Better Call Saul finale: Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn break down Kim's shocking pitch to Jimmy |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n\nLalo is awake at 3 a.m, so Nacho sets a fire as a distraction that enables him to open the gate.

It is also the name of the commune of the island, a part of the [[province of Latina]] in the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ChiaiaDiLuna Wiki.jpg|thumb|The most popular beach at Ponza, Chiaia di Luna.]]\n[[File:Ponza.jpg|thumb|View of the harbor.]]\nThe island was inhabited from [[neolithic]] through [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. According to local legends, Ponza was named after [[Pontius Pilate]], Roman governor of [[Judea]] who tried [[Jesus of Nazareth]] for [[sedition]] against Roman rule. Pontius Pilate's family owned a grotto on Ponza, which is still named after him. The Pontius Pilate legend of Ponza's name has recently come into dispute amongst historians, because the name \"Pontia\" appears in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography''. This pre-dates the birth of Pilate. <ref>This only excludes the possibility that the name is derived from ''that particular'' Pontius. Since names were, generally, repeatedly applied in Roman families -- even to the point of  having several sons with the same ''nomen'' but differing ''cognomina'' -- it remains plausible that an earlier ''Pontius'' inspired the name.</ref> It is not known if this is the same name as Ponza or a similar name. Also, ''Pontia'' means \"Land of Bridges\" in Latin, a name which could have been applied for Ponza's many naturally occurring arches and bridge-like landforms. Another theory is that the name is of Greek origin, from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pontos'', ''\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'', sea (see also [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]]).\n\n===Greek and Roman periods===\nIn ancient times the island was called ''Tyrrhenia''. Legend says that Ponza is what is left of the lost island of Tyrrhenia. Ponza is said to have been connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land, which sank into the sea with most of the island below the water, with the parts remaining above [[sea level]]. The same exact phenomenon happened at [[Capri]]. According to legend, there was a large city on the ancient island. There has been significant archaeological progress recently that shows this may be true. For example, it was discovered that the harbor floor of nearby [[Pozzuoli]] had sunk and risen several times in the last 5,000 years, revealing sunken Roman [[temple]]s.\n\nPonza was first colonised by [[Etruscans]]. The island was heavily forested with giant trees in ancient times, but the forest is gone and the hills are covered with man-made [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]s. Most of these terraces are no longer being used to grow food and grapes and are falling apart, due to lack of maintenance. The tallest hill on the island, called Monte Guardia, still has the rotting stumps of the extinct giant trees over eight feet wide. Crops are grown on these terraces like [[grape]]s for wine and [[opuntia|cactus pears]] and [[ficus|fig]] trees.\n\nPonza is also suspected to be the island of [[Aeaea]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', as the island of [[Circe]] the sorceress, where her cave or grotto was. Today it is known as Grotta della Maga Circe on the west side of the island, between [[Capo Bianco]] and [[Chaia di Luna]] beach. She was said to have lived in this cave in the winter months, spending the summer atop nearby Mount Circe on the mainland of Italy. This is where the Circe turned [[Odysseus]]' men into animals and cast her spell on and seduced him and lived with him for over a year. On the west side of Ponza is the Grotta di Ulisse O Del Sangue, which means Cave of Ulysses or the Blood. The [[Grotto]] or cave is almost directly underneath the hill/peninsula called Il [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]], which has the [[Giardino Botanico Ponziano]] a [[botanical garden]] with a villa and the remains of a castle.  These caves or grottoes are popular destinations to visit by boat only.\n[[File:Ponza cala fonte20.JPG|190px|right|View of Cala Fonte harbour in Le Forna area]]\n[[File:Ponza cala feola3.JPG|190px|right|view of one of the most beautiful bays located in Le Forna area]]\n\nDuring Roman times, [[Nero Julius Caesar|Nero Caesar]], eldest brother of [[Caligula]], was deported to Ponza in AD 29, where he was put to death the following year. Two of his sisters, Agrippina the Younger (mother of the emperor Nero) and [[Julia Livilla]], were exiled to Ponza in AD 39 for their complicity in a plot to overthrow Caligula. They were recalled to Rome in AD 41. Julia Livilla had a mansion named Palazzo Giulia (Julia's Palace) built specially for her on Ponza. The ruins are still visible. A similar mansion with the same name was also built on nearby [[Ventotene]] for Emperor Augustus' exiled daughter, [[Julia the Elder]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nPonza was abandoned during the [[Middle Ages]] due to constant raids by [[Saracens]] and [[pirate]]s. In 1552, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet under the command of [[Turgut Reis]] (known as [[Dragut]] in the West) defeated the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] fleet of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] under the command of the famous [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] admiral [[Andrea Doria]] near Ponza.\n\n===1700\u2013present===\nDuring the 18th century, the [[Kingdom of Naples]] re-colonized the island. In 1813 it was captured by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] naval captain [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The annual register or a view of the history, politics and literature for the year 1813|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkHLaP_RROIC|year=1823|publisher=Baldwin|page=161}}</ref>\n\nThe island became part of the Kingdom of Italy in the mid-19th century and it is now part of the Republic of Italy. The island's isolation destined it to serve as a [[penal colony]] by various regimes. During the two decades of [[fascism]], Ponza and nearby [[Ventotene]] served as a prison for political opponents of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime. The Ethiopian Prince Regent and military leader, [[Imru Haile Selassie|Ras Immiru]], who was captured by the Italian Army in 1936, was imprisoned in a house in Santa Maria. Mussolini himself was imprisoned on the island for several weeks after being overthrown and arrested in 1943.\n\nThe island is well known for the tragic story of [[Lucia Rosa]] who threw herself into the Tyrrhenian Sea rather than being forced to marry a man against her wishes. She is viewed by many women around the world as a [[martyr]] for women's rights and symbol for human rights.\n\nA few years ago{{when|date=May 2015}}, engineers working on an ancient Roman tunnel that connected the harbour part of Ponza to the neighborhood of [[Santa Maria (Ponza)|Santa Maria]] used explosives to dig a conduit nearby &mdash; they were supposed to use a [[chisel]]. The explosive shock shattered and destroyed a 2,100-year-old Roman gallery tunnel. The tunnel that connects Ponza with Santa Maria is now repaired, but many residents{{who|date=May 2015}} complain that it does not look like it used to, with steel reinforced concrete in place of Roman bricks.\n\nToday, the island is a [[tourist attraction]] with sandy beaches like Chiaia di Luna or Half Moon Beach, now permanently closed due to falling rocks from the huge collapsing cliff above. Several tourists were killed a few years ago{{when|date=May 2015}} while sunbathing on the beach. The Italian National Park Service has installed steel cable netting to prevent further rock falls and deaths. The Roman Galleria or Roman Tunnel that connected the beach to the road is now closed because of collapsing Roman brickwork. Many beaches that were very popular are now permanently closed because falling rocks from overhead cliffs have killed vacationers.\n\nIn the late summer/early fall of 2007, six \"aquanauts\" spent two weeks living underwater off the coast of Ponza, breaking all other records.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Geography==\nPonza and Gavi are the remains of a caldera rim of an extinct [[volcano]], with a surface area of {{convert|7.3|km2|1|abbr=off}}. Ponza is approximately {{convert|5.5|mi|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} at its widest. It is a crescent shaped island with one large beach called Spiaggia di Chiaia di Luna (Half Moon Beach) and a few small beaches and has a mostly rocky coast made of [[kaolin]] and [[tuff]] rock. The island has layers of Kaolinite and Bentonite which used to be mined. It has many odd natural rock formations, one looks like a [[monk]], another looks like a giant pair of work pants, [[Spaccapurpo]] (Arco Naturale O Spaccapolpi), another looks like a patch of flowers and another one looks like mushrooms, another looks like a horseman. It has the Fantasy Rock Castle and several natural bridges and arches. It also has Faragliones or giant sea [[stack (geology)|stacks]] made of solid rock. It has several small villages, among them are Commune di Ponza, Santa Maria and Le Forna. Ponza is often confused with nearby islands like [[Ischia]] and [[Capri]], except Ponza has no active volcanism.\n\n===Climate===\nPonza has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer mediterranean climate|mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csa'') with hot and dry summers combined with mild and rainy winters.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ponza (1971\u20132000, extremes 1946\u2013present)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 17.4\n|Feb record high C = 20.0\n|Mar record high C = 22.0\n|Apr record high C = 22.4\n|May record high C = 28.2\n|Jun record high C = 31.8\n|Jul record high C = 37.2\n|Aug record high C = 35.6\n|Sep record high C = 32.6\n|Oct record high C = 27.3\n|Nov record high C = 23.4\n|Dec record high C = 19.6\n|year record high C = 37.2\n|Jan high C = 12.1\n|Feb high C = 12.1\n|Mar high C = 13.5\n|Apr high C = 15.7\n|May high C = 20.3\n|Jun high C = 24.5\n|Jul high C = 27.4\n|Aug high C = 28.0\n|Sep high C = 24.6\n|Oct high C = 20.3\n|Nov high C = 16.0\n|Dec high C = 13.2\n|year high C = 19.0\n|Jan mean C = 10.4\n|Feb mean C = 10.3\n|Mar mean C = 11.4\n|Apr mean C = 13.3\n|May mean C = 17.5\n|Jun mean C = 21.4\n|Jul mean C = 24.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.0\n|Sep mean C = 22.0\n|Oct mean C = 18.3\n|Nov mean C = 14.2\n|Dec mean C = 11.7\n|year mean C = 16.6\n|Jan low C = 8.8\n|Feb low C = 8.4\n|Mar low C = 9.3\n|Apr low C = 11.0\n|May low C = 14.8\n|Jun low C = 18.4\n|Jul low C = 21.1\n|Aug low C = 21.9\n|Sep low C = 19.4\n|Oct low C = 16.2\n|Nov low C = 12.5\n|Dec low C = 10.0\n|year low C = 14.3\n|Jan record low C = -2.0\n|Feb record low C = -0.5\n|Mar record low C = -2.6\n|Apr record low C = 2.8\n|May record low C = 7.8\n|Jun record low C = 10.2\n|Jul record low C = 13.4\n|Aug record low C = 15.0\n|Sep record low C = 11.5\n|Oct record low C = 7.0\n|Nov record low C = 2.2\n|Dec record low C = 0.6\n|year record low C = -2.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 64.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 63.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 40.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 40.4\n|May precipitation mm = 20.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 17.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 18.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 65.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 109.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 111.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 76.2\n|year precipitation mm = 639.3\n|Jan humidity = 75\n|Feb humidity = 74\n|Mar humidity = 75\n|Apr humidity = 77\n|May humidity = 77\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 73\n|Aug humidity = 75\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 77\n|Nov humidity = 73\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|year humidity = 75\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 7.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 6.2\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.6\n|May precipitation days = 3.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.0\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 5.1\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.0\n|Nov precipitation days = 9.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.7\n|year precipitation days = 67.2\n|source 1 = Servizio Meteorologico (humidity 1961\u20131990)<ref name=SM>{{cite web\n| url = http://clima.meteoam.it/AtlanteClim2/pdf/(280)Ponza.pdf\n| title = Ponza/Isola Di (LT)\n| work = Atlante climatico\n| publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n| accessdate = 19 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=SMsun>{{cite web\n| url = http://clima.meteoam.it/web_clima_sysman/Clino6190/CLINO280.txt\n| title = STAZIONE  280  Ponza: medie mensili periodo  61 - 90\n| publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n| accessdate = 19 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=extremes>{{cite web\n| url = http://climaintoscana.altervista.org/italia/stazioni-wmo/ponza/\n| title = Ponza: Record mensili dal 1946\n| publisher = Servizio Meteorologico dell\u2019Aeronautica Militare\n| language = Italian\n| accessdate = 19 May 2015}}</ref>\n|date=May 2015\n}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe island is famed for its Blue Grottoes, which were created by the Etruscans. Among them are Serpents Grotto and the Roman Gallery, a Roman tunnel that connects the town of Ponza to the (now closed) large sandy beach called Chiaia di Luna on the west side. The island has many [[archeology|archeological]] [[ruins]] visible everywhere, including [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], Canaanite, Greek, and Phoenician necropoli ruins in the middle of the island.  There are [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] ruins on parts of the island jumbled with Roman ruins. A large statue called ''Il Mamozio'' (\"The Mummy\") or ''Il Mitreo'', meaning miter or priest's hat, is a 3,000-year-old [[marble]] [[statue]] and was found in the harbor. Depicting a local Etrurian consul, it is now displayed in a museum in [[Naples]] behind protective plastic, where it was reunited with its head. It is the oldest known Etruscan statue of its kind and extremely rare.\n\n==Economy==\nThe town of Ponza is a fishing and boating port with several large [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s that can accommodate large ships. Its biggest industry is [[tourism]] followed by boatbuilding, boat repair and fishing.\n\nThe four [[mining|mine]]s at the northern end \u2014 the most beautiful area of the island \u2014 were closed down in 1975 by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency because the mining operation was destroying the wildlife and flora, which are [[Endangered species]]. The mines produced [[kaolinite|kaolin]]  and [[Bentonite]]. Kaolin is used in making Kaolin-Pectin medicine and the manufacture of porcellain.\n\nPonza has a two lane road that goes from north to south, but can accommodate small cars only. An airstrip planned for the north of the island was canceled due to environmental concerns. Because there is no airstrip, seaplanes visit the island instead.\n\nCelebrities who have vacationed on Ponza include [[Kirk Douglas]], his son [[Michael Douglas]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Elsa Martinelli]] and [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and his son, [[Philippe Cousteau]], who filmed several documentaries in the area.\n\nFederico Fellini's ''[[Satyricon]]'' (1969) was filmed on Ponza. Some scenes in Wes Anderson's film ''[[The Life Aquatic]]'' were filmed on the island; Ponza was instead called in the movie, \"Port-au-Patois\". [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/] [http://www.thefilmfactory.co.uk/lifeaquatic/] [https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Ponza%20Island,%20Ponziane%20Islands,%20Latina,%20Lazio,%20Italy&&heading=18;with+locations+including;Ponza%20Island,%20Ponziane%20Islands,%20Latina,%20Lazio,%20Italy]\n\nThe [[Rai Fiction]] television series, \"Un'altra Vita\" (2014), was largely filmed on Ponza. [http://www.unaltravita.rai.it/dl/portali/site/page/Page-cfcc3091-754e-40c8-beb3-4b890ba647b9.html] Many of the scenes showcase the hilly landscape and rugged shoreline of the island.\n\nMost of the people who live there raise rabbits and chickens and other animals in coops for meat to make [[cacciatore]]. Other farmed animals include goats, [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and [[pigeon]]s.\n\nMany of the original inhabitants of Ponza are now leaving the island. They are steadily being replaced by other Italians from the mainland. Many local children simply move away after becoming adults and never return.\n\nThe local economy is in a downturn partly due to the severe restrictions on commercial fishing.\n\n==Transportation==\nFerries reach Ponza from [[Naples]], [[Terracina]], [[Formia]] and [[Anzio]]; there are also [[hydrofoil]]s (aliscafo) from Anzio and Formia that take about 75&nbsp;minutes. The ferries and hydrofoils may not depart to and from Ponza during severe weather conditions.

These caves or grottoes are popular destinations to visit by boat only.\n[[File:Ponza cala fonte20.JPG|190px|right|View of Cala Fonte harbour in Le Forna area]]\n[[File:Ponza cala feola3.JPG|190px|right|view of one of the most beautiful bays located in Le Forna area]]\n\nDuring Roman times, [[Nero Julius Caesar|Nero Caesar]], eldest brother of [[Caligula]], was deported to Ponza in AD 29, where he was put to death the following year. Two of his sisters, Agrippina the Younger (mother of the emperor Nero) and [[Julia Livilla]], were exiled to Ponza in AD 39 for their complicity in a plot to overthrow Caligula. They were recalled to Rome in AD 41. Julia Livilla had a mansion named Palazzo Giulia (Julia's Palace) built specially for her on Ponza. The ruins are still visible. A similar mansion with the same name was also built on nearby [[Ventotene]] for Emperor Augustus' exiled daughter, [[Julia the Elder]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nPonza was abandoned during the [[Middle Ages]] due to constant raids by [[Saracens]] and [[pirate]]s. In 1552, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet under the command of [[Turgut Reis]] (known as [[Dragut]] in the West) defeated the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] fleet of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] under the command of the famous [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] admiral [[Andrea Doria]] near Ponza.\n\n===1700\u2013present===\nDuring the 18th century, the [[Kingdom of Naples]] re-colonized the island. In 1813 it was captured by [[Great Britain|British]] naval captain [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The annual register or a view of the history, politics and literature for the year 1813|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkHLaP_RROIC|year=1823|publisher=Baldwin|page=161}}</ref>\n\nThe island became part of the Kingdom of Italy in the mid-19th century and it is now part of the Republic of Italy. The island's isolation destined it to serve as a [[penal colony]] by various regimes. During the two decades of [[fascism]], Ponza and nearby [[Ventotene]] served as a prison for political opponents of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime. The Ethiopian Prince Regent and military leader, [[Imru Haile Selassie|Ras Immiru]], who was captured by the Italian Army in 1936, was imprisoned in a house in Santa Maria. Mussolini himself was imprisoned on the island for several weeks after being overthrown and arrested in 1943.\n\nThe island is well known for the tragic story of [[Lucia Rosa]] who threw herself into the Tyrrhenian Sea rather than being forced to marry a man against her wishes. She is viewed by many women around the world as a [[martyr]] for women's rights and symbol for human rights.\n\nA few years ago{{when|date=May 2015}}, engineers working on an ancient Roman tunnel that connected the harbour part of Ponza to the neighborhood of [[Santa Maria (Ponza)|Santa Maria]] used explosives to dig a conduit nearby &mdash; they were supposed to use a [[chisel]]. The explosive shock shattered and destroyed a 2,100-year-old Roman gallery tunnel. The tunnel that connects Ponza with Santa Maria is now repaired, but many residents{{who|date=May 2015}} complain that it does not look like it used to, with steel reinforced concrete in place of Roman bricks.\n\nToday, the island is a [[tourist attraction]] with sandy beaches like Chiaia di Luna or Half Moon Beach, now permanently closed due to falling rocks from the huge collapsing cliff above. Several tourists were killed a few years ago{{when|date=May 2015}} while sunbathing on the beach. The Italian National Park Service has installed steel cable netting to prevent further rock falls and deaths. The Roman Galleria or Roman Tunnel that connected the beach to the road is now closed because of collapsing Roman brickwork. Many beaches that were very popular are now permanently closed because falling rocks from overhead cliffs have killed vacationers.\n\nIn the late summer/early fall of 2007, six \"aquanauts\" spent two weeks living underwater off the coast of Ponza, breaking all other records.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Geography==\nPonza and Gavi are the remains of a caldera rim of an extinct [[volcano]], with a surface area of {{convert|7.3|km2|1|abbr=off}}. Ponza is approximately {{convert|5.5|mi|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} at its widest. It is a crescent shaped island with one large beach called Spiaggia di Chiaia di Luna (Half Moon Beach) and a few small beaches and has a mostly rocky coast made of [[kaolin]] and [[tuff]] rock. The island has layers of Kaolinite and Bentonite which used to be mined. It has many odd natural rock formations, one looks like a [[monk]], another looks like a giant pair of work pants, [[Spaccapurpo]] (Arco Naturale O Spaccapolpi), another looks like a patch of flowers and another one looks like mushrooms, another looks like a horseman. It has the Fantasy Rock Castle and several natural bridges and arches. It also has Faragliones or giant sea [[stack (geology)|stacks]] made of solid rock. It has several small villages, among them are Commune di Ponza, Santa Maria and Le Forna. Ponza is often confused with nearby islands like [[Ischia]] and [[Capri]], except Ponza has no active volcanism.\n\n===Climate===\nPonza has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer mediterranean climate|mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csa'') with hot and dry summers combined with mild and rainy winters.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ponza (1971\u20132000, extremes 1946\u2013present)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 17.4\n|Feb record high C = 20.0\n|Mar record high C = 22.0\n|Apr record high C = 22.4\n|May record high C = 28.2\n|Jun record high C = 31.8\n|Jul record high C = 37.2\n|Aug record high C = 35.6\n|Sep record high C = 32.6\n|Oct record high C = 27.3\n|Nov record high C = 23.4\n|Dec record high C = 19.6\n|year record high C = 37.2\n|Jan high C = 12.1\n|Feb high C = 12.1\n|Mar high C = 13.5\n|Apr high C = 15.7\n|May high C = 20.3\n|Jun high C = 24.5\n|Jul high C = 27.4\n|Aug high C = 28.0\n|Sep high C = 24.6\n|Oct high C = 20.3\n|Nov high C = 16.0\n|Dec high C = 13.2\n|year high C = 19.0\n|Jan mean C = 10.4\n|Feb mean C = 10.3\n|Mar mean C = 11.4\n|Apr mean C = 13.3\n|May mean C = 17.5\n|Jun mean C = 21.4\n|Jul mean C = 24.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.0\n|Sep mean C = 22.0\n|Oct mean C = 18.3\n|Nov mean C = 14.2\n|Dec mean C = 11.7\n|year mean C = 16.6\n|Jan low C = 8.8\n|Feb low C = 8.4\n|Mar low C = 9.3\n|Apr low C = 11.0\n|May low C = 14.8\n|Jun low C = 18.4\n|Jul low C = 21.1\n|Aug low C = 21.9\n|Sep low C = 19.4\n|Oct low C = 16.2\n|Nov low C = 12.5\n|Dec low C = 10.0\n|year low C = 14.3\n|Jan record low C = -2.0\n|Feb record low C = -0.5\n|Mar record low C = -2.6\n|Apr record low C = 2.8\n|May record low C = 7.8\n|Jun record low C = 10.2\n|Jul record low C = 13.4\n|Aug record low C = 15.0\n|Sep record low C = 11.5\n|Oct record low C = 7.0\n|Nov record low C = 2.2\n|Dec record low C = 0.6\n|year record low C = -2.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 64.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 63.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 40.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 40.4\n|May precipitation mm = 20.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 17.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 18.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 65.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 109.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 111.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 76.2\n|year precipitation mm = 639.3\n|Jan humidity = 75\n|Feb humidity = 74\n|Mar humidity = 75\n|Apr humidity = 77\n|May humidity = 77\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 73\n|Aug humidity = 75\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 77\n|Nov humidity = 73\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|year humidity = 75\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 7.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 6.2\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.6\n|May precipitation days = 3.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.0\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 5.1\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.0\n|Nov precipitation days = 9.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.7\n|year precipitation days = 67.2\n|source 1 = Servizio Meteorologico (humidity 1961\u20131990)<ref name=SM>{{cite web\n| url = http://clima.meteoam.it/AtlanteClim2/pdf/(280)Ponza.pdf\n| title = Ponza/Isola Di (LT)\n| work = Atlante climatico\n| publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n| accessdate = 19 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=SMsun>{{cite web\n| url = http://clima.meteoam.it/web_clima_sysman/Clino6190/CLINO280.txt\n| title = STAZIONE  280  Ponza: medie mensili periodo  61 - 90\n| publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n| accessdate = 19 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=extremes>{{cite web\n| url = http://climaintoscana.altervista.org/italia/stazioni-wmo/ponza/\n| title = Ponza: Record mensili dal 1946\n| publisher = Servizio Meteorologico dell\u2019Aeronautica Militare\n| language = Italian\n| accessdate = 19 May 2015}}</ref>\n|date=May 2015\n}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe island is famed for its Blue Grottoes, which were created by the Etruscans. Among them are Serpents Grotto and the Roman Gallery, a Roman tunnel that connects the town of Ponza to the (now closed) large sandy beach called Chiaia di Luna on the west side. The island has many [[archeology|archeological]] [[ruins]] visible everywhere, including [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], Canaanite, Greek, and Phoenician necropoli ruins in the middle of the island.  There are [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] ruins on parts of the island jumbled with Roman ruins. A large statue called ''Il Mamozio'' (\"The Mummy\") or ''Il Mitreo'', meaning miter or priest's hat, is a 3,000-year-old [[marble]] [[statue]] and was found in the harbor. Depicting a local Etrurian consul, it is now displayed in a museum in [[Naples]] behind protective plastic, where it was reunited with its head. It is the oldest known Etruscan statue of its kind and extremely rare.\n\n==Economy==\nThe town of Ponza is a fishing and boating port with several large [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s that can accommodate large ships. Its biggest industry is [[tourism]] followed by boatbuilding, boat repair and fishing.\n\nThe four [[mining|mine]]s at the northern end \u2014 the most beautiful area of the island \u2014 were closed down in 1975 by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency because the mining operation was destroying the wildlife and flora, which are [[Endangered species]]. The mines produced [[kaolinite|kaolin]]  and [[Bentonite]]. Kaolin is used in making Kaolin-Pectin medicine and the manufacture of porcellain.\n\nPonza has a two lane road that goes from north to south, but can accommodate small cars only. An airstrip planned for the north of the island was canceled due to environmental concerns. Because there is no airstrip, seaplanes visit the island instead.\n\nCelebrities who have vacationed on Ponza include [[Kirk Douglas]], his son [[Michael Douglas]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Elsa Martinelli]] and [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and his son, [[Philippe Cousteau]], who filmed several documentaries in the area.\n\nFederico Fellini's ''[[Satyricon]]'' (1969) was filmed on Ponza. Some scenes in Wes Anderson's film ''[[The Life Aquatic]]'' were filmed on the island; Ponza was instead called in the movie, \"Port-au-Patois\". [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/] [http://www.thefilmfactory.co.uk/lifeaquatic/] [https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Ponza%20Island,%20Ponziane%20Islands,%20Latina,%20Lazio,%20Italy&&heading=18;with+locations+including;Ponza%20Island,%20Ponziane%20Islands,%20Latina,%20Lazio,%20Italy]\n\nThe [[Rai Fiction]] television series, \"Un'altra Vita\" (2014), was largely filmed on Ponza. [http://www.unaltravita.rai.it/dl/portali/site/page/Page-cfcc3091-754e-40c8-beb3-4b890ba647b9.html] Many of the scenes showcase the hilly landscape and rugged shoreline of the island.\n\nMost of the people who live there raise rabbits and chickens and other animals in coops for meat to make [[cacciatore]]. Other farmed animals include goats, [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and [[pigeon]]s.\n\nMany of the original inhabitants of Ponza are now leaving the island. They are steadily being replaced by other Italians from the mainland. Many local children simply move away after becoming adults and never return.\n\nThe local economy is in a downturn partly due to the severe restrictions on commercial fishing.\n\n==Transportation==\nFerries reach Ponza from [[Naples]], [[Terracina]], [[Formia]] and [[Anzio]]; there are also [[hydrofoil]]s (aliscafo) from Anzio and Formia that take about 75&nbsp;minutes. The ferries and hydrofoils may not depart to and from Ponza during severe weather conditions. Much of Ponza is accessible by car and a bus runs the length of the island.\n\n== Main sights ==\n* [[Giardino Botanico Ponziano]] \"Ponza's Botanical Garden\"\n* [[Capo Bianco]] \"Cape White\" Italian National Natural Monument\n* [[Spiaggia di Chaia di Luna]] (\"Moon Gravel Beach\")\n* [[Grotta della Maga Circe]] (\"Cave of the Sorceress [[Circe]]\")\n* [[Grotta di Ulisse o del Sangue]] \"Cave of Ulysses ([[Odysseus]]) of the Blood\" \n* [[Monte Guardia]] (\"Watchout Hill\"), Ponza's tallest hill\n* [[Arco Naturale o Spaccapolpi]], a natural arch standing in deep water looks like giant pants\n* [[Grotta Azzurra (Ponza)|Grotta Azzurra]], a [[sea cave]] complex \n* [[Spiaggia delle Felci]], a beach\n* [[Grotta di Serpent]] an underground maze of tunnels built by the Romans, much of it blocked off for safety reasons.\n* [[Grotte di Pilato]], built by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n* [[Spiaggia Di Le Forna]], a smaller and tourist beach.\n* natural saltwater swimming pool in Le Forna.\n* [[Faraglioni di Lucia Rosa]] (Rocky shoals) named in honor of [[Lucia Rosa]]\n* [[Spiaggia di Frontone]], a beach\n* [[Spiaggia di Santa Maria]], a beach\n* [[Cala Fonte]] Natural fisherman's harbor, swimming on the north side is interesting.\n* [[Bue marino cave]] a cave where the seals were used to find cover.\n* [[cala Gaetano]] Beautiful sea colors, nice variety of fish during the spring time are visible.\n* [[La Caletta]] Also called the sunset coast where is possible to admire some beautiful sunsets.\n* [[Forte Papa]] An ancient fortress used to defend the island from Saracens attacks from the sea.\n\n== Feasts ==\n* June 20 feast of St [[Pope Silverius|Silverius]]\n* August 15 feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of islands of Italy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book|first=Greg|last=Annussek|year=2005|title=Hitler's Raid to Save Mussolini: The Most Infamous Commando Operation of World War II|location=Cambridge|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-81396-3|pages=106\u2013107}}\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0151q7j/ \"In Our Time\" Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Etruscan civilization], With: Phil Perkins, professor of Archaeology at the Open University; David Ridgway, senior research fellow at the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of London; and Corinna Riva, lecturer in Mediterranean Archaeology at University College London.\n\n== External links==\n{{Commons|Ponza}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Ponza}}\n*[http://www.comune.ponza.lt.it/ Comune di Ponza website] {{in lang|it}}\n*[http://www.ponza.com/ Ponza website] {{in lang|it}}\n*[http://www.giardinoponza.it/ Giardino Botanico Ponziano]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311212458/http://www.ponziane.com/ Ponza's Encyclopaedia] {{in lang|it}}\n\n{{coord|40|54|27|N|12|57|9|E|region:IT_type:isle|display=title}}\n \n{{Portalbar|Geography|Islands|Italy}}\n{{ Pontine Islands}}\n\n[[Category:Calderas of Italy]]\n[[Category:Inactive volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Islands of Lazio]]\n[[Category:Italian fascist internment camps in Italy]]\n[[Category:Mediterranean islands]]\n[[Category:Pontius Pilate]]\n[[Category:Province of Latina]]\n[[Category:Submarine calderas]]\n[[Category:Tyrrhenian Sea]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponza"}
