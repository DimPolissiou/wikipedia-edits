Co-written with [[Mark D. Sanders]], the song is a re-telling of the murderous bluegrass standard \"[[Little Sadie]]\" told from the victim's point of view.\n\n== Recordings ==\n\n\"[[Little Sadie]]\" featured prominently on her first [[CD]], ''[[Plow to the End of the Row]]'', produced with another [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based musician, [[Will Kimbrough]], and released on her own [[AddieBelle]] [[record label]].  (The label takes its name from a nickname Young was given while working as a tour guide at Nashville's [[Belle Meade Mansion]].)  The [[CD]], which includes a packet of wildflower seeds along with artwork based on the ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Album Package.\n\nAn early version of ''Plow to the End of the Row'', released in 2003, has become a sought-after collectible.  That version included several tracks with Young backed by [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and was a top pick for 2003 Debut Artist by the Freeform American Roots DJ Chart.  The nationally-released version, featuring different sequencing, new tracks, and re-recorded versions of several songs, was released on April 13, 2004, one day before an interview with Young aired on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  The [[Americana Music Association]] included Young and her band in their nominees for Emerging Artist of the Year, and the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' named \"Home Remedy\" as Best Country Single of the year.  The CD went on to place at or near the top of numerous \"best of\" lists for the year and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Young \"the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music find of the year.\"\n\n[[Image:Adrienne Young Andy Thacker Little Sadie Little Grill Collective Harrisonburg VA June 2008.jpg|left|thumb|250px|With Andy Thacker of Little Sadie<br>[[Little Grill Collective]], June 27, 2008.]]\nYoung and her band Little Sadie (at the time, Tyler Grant on guitar, Clayton Campbell on fiddle and mandolin, Amanda Kowalski on bass, and Steven Sandifer on percussion) toured extensively across the U.S. and in England.  The members of the band left to pursue other projects prior to the recording of Young's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]''.\n\nThat disc, released on June 28, 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Benjamin Franklin#Thirteen Virtues|Thirteen Virtues]]''.  A copy of Franklin's pamphlet is included with the CD.  Will Kimbrough co-produced the CD and co-wrote several tracks.  Alongside original songs and traditional tunes, the disc featured a cover of the [[Grateful Dead]] song \"Brokedown Palace\".  Young's AddieBelle label struck a distribution deal with [[Ryko Records]] which insured that her music got placed in more record stores.  She also continued to receive support from [[public radio]] and was invited to appear on ''[[World Cafe]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', and ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''.  With a new incarnation of Little Sadie (fiddler and banjoist Eric Merrill, guitarist Hans Holzen, bassist Kyle Kegerreis, and percussionist Eric Platz), Young toured even more extensively in 2005.\n\n''The Art of Virtue'' placed third in [[Amazon.com]]'s list of the best folk recordings of the year.  Young was invited to sing in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on January 17, 2006, as part of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday celebration.\n\nIn May 2006 Young took her band to [[Levon Helm]]'s studio in [[Woodstock, New York]] to record tracks for a third album, titled ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]],'' which was released May 22, 2007.\n\n== Social and environmental action ==\n\nYoung's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' released in 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''Thirteen Virtues'' and included copy of Franklin's pamphlet inside.

The money will provide non-genetically modified seeds to community gardens across North America.\n\nYoung has toured with help from the organization Buy Fresh Buy Local and each of the 49 FoodRoutes chapters. Along with her performances, each tour stop offered sustainable living workshops with local sponsors in each community. \"Preserving cultural genetics and agricultural heritage is the key to true security and self-reliance\", she says.\n\nYoung says her music has influenced her activism because she feels at peace in nature and wants to communicate those feelings through her music.\n\nAs of 2010, Adrienne Young has hosted and organized the Backyard Revolution, a group of people sharing and demonstrating unique skills of the past and present to help educate people in self sustainability.  The Backyard Revolution was present at Floyd Fest 9 (2010) and the Heritage Harvest Festival at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello.

Meanwhile, Susan Murphy of [[Modesto, California]] is going to be married to news weatherman, Derek Dietl. Just before the ceremony, she is struck by the meteorite and its energy causes her to glow green and grow to an enormous size with her hair turning white during the wedding. A U.S. military detachment tranquilizes and captures her. She awakens in a top-secret [[Area 51|government facility]] that houses monsters of which the public are ignorant. She meets General W.R. Monger, the [[U.S. Army|Army]] officer in charge of the facility, and her fellow monster inmates: Dr. Cockroach P.H.D., a [[scientist]] who became half-human, half-cockroach after an experiment; B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), a brainless, living mass of blue goo as a result of a food flavoring mutation; Insectosaurus, a massive bug mutated by nuclear radiation standing 350 feet in height, and the Missing Link, a prehistoric 20,000-year-old fish-ape hybrid who was thawed from deep ice by scientists. Susan, herself renamed to \"Ginormica\", is forbidden any contact with her friends and family, leaving her feeling increasingly isolated.\n\nOn a mysterious spaceship in deep space, an alien overlord named Gallaxhar is alerted to the presence of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a robotic probe to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth where the [[President of the United States]] attempts to make the first contact with it. However, the attempt fails and the probe goes on a destructive rampage, headed straight for [[San Francisco]]. Monger convinces the President to grant the monsters their freedom if they can stop the probe. In San Francisco, the robot detects the quantonium radiating through Susan's body and tries to take it from her, putting many lives at risk. At the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the monsters work together and manage to defeat the probe.\n\nGallaxhar sets a course for Earth to obtain the quantonium in person while the now-free Susan returns home with her new friends and reunites with her family. However, the monsters alienate themselves from humans due to their inexperience with social situations. Derek breaks off his engagement with Susan, claiming that he cannot marry someone who would overshadow him and his career. Heartbroken, the monsters reunite, but Susan finally realizes that her life is better as a monster and promises not to sell herself ''short'' to anyone again. Suddenly, Susan is pulled into Gallaxhar's spaceship. Insectosaurus tries to save her, but he is shot down by the ship's plasma cannons, seemingly killing him.\n\nOnboard the ship, Susan breaks free from her prison cell and furiously chases down Gallaxhar, but is trapped by a machine that extracts the quantonium from her body, shrinking her back to her normal size. Gallaxhar then uses the extracted quantonium to create [[cloning|clones]] of himself in order to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth. Monger manages to get the monsters on board the ship. They rescue Susan and make their way to the main power core where Dr. Cockroach sets the ship to self-destruct to prevent the invasion. All but Susan are trapped as the blast doors close and she personally confronts Gallaxhar on the bridge. With time running out, she sends the ball of stored quantonium down on herself, restoring her monstrous size and strength. After rescuing her friends, they flee the ship and meet with Monger and Insectosaurus, who has morphed into a giant butterfly. The ship self-destructs, killing Gallaxhar and his army.\n\nReturning to Modesto, Susan and the monsters receive a hero's welcome. Hoping to take advantage of Susan's fame for his own career, Derek tries to get back together with her, but she rejects him. Monger then arrives to tell the monsters about a new monstrous [[snail]] called \"Escargantua\" slowly making its way to [[Paris]], and the film ends with the monsters taking off to confront the new menace.\n<!-- Do not add any reference to the post-credits scene. -->\n\n==Voice cast==\n===Monsters===\n<!-- DO NOT add unsourced material and speculation (such as \"apparently\", \"evidently\", \"probably\", etc).

Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall monster, is a nod to the 1961 Kaiju film ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]''. According to Vernon, the Missing Link has no direct inspiration. He \"just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people.\"<ref name=NYTInspired /> For the San Francisco sequence, the producers researched lots of films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city, and filmed animator Line Andersen, who had a similar body type to Ginormica&mdash;tall, thin, and athletic-looking&mdash;walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco, to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an environment would walk around it.<ref name=MvADVD>\"Modern Movie Monster-Making\", ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' DVD</ref>\n\nEd Leonard, CTO of DreamWorks Animation, says it took approximately 45.6 million computing hours to make ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', more than eight times as many as the original ''[[Shrek]]''.

Meanwhile, Susan Murphy of [[Modesto, California]] is going to be married to news weatherman, Derek Dietl. Just before the ceremony, she is struck by the meteorite and its energy causes her to glow green and grow to an enormous size with her hair turning white during the wedding. A U.S. military detachment tranquilizes and captures her. She awakens in a top-secret [[Area 51|government facility]] that houses monsters of which the public are ignorant. She meets General W.R. Monger, the [[U.S. Army|Army]] officer in charge of the facility, and her fellow monster inmates: Dr. Cockroach P.H.D., a [[scientist]] who became half-human, half-cockroach after an experiment; B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), a brainless, living mass of blue goo as a result of a food flavoring mutation; Insectosaurus, a massive bug mutated by nuclear radiation standing 350 feet in height, and the Missing Link, a prehistoric 20,000-year-old fish-ape hybrid who was thawed from deep ice by scientists. Susan, herself renamed to \"Ginormica\", is forbidden any contact with her friends and family, leaving her feeling increasingly isolated.\n\nOn a mysterious spaceship in deep space, an alien overlord named Gallaxhar is alerted to the presence of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a robotic probe to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth where the [[President of the United States]] attempts to make the first contact with it. However, the attempt fails and the probe goes on a destructive rampage, headed straight for [[San Francisco]]. Monger convinces the President to grant the monsters their freedom if they can stop the probe. In San Francisco, the robot detects the quantonium radiating through Susan's body and tries to take it from her, putting many lives at risk. At the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the monsters work together and manage to defeat the probe.\n\nGallaxhar sets a course for Earth to obtain the quantonium in person while the now-free Susan returns home with her new friends and reunites with her family. However, the monsters alienate themselves from humans due to their inexperience with social situations. Derek breaks off his engagement with Susan, claiming that he cannot marry someone who would overshadow him and his career. Heartbroken, the monsters reunite, but Susan finally realizes that her life is better as a monster and promises not to sell herself ''short'' to anyone again. Suddenly, Susan is pulled into Gallaxhar's spaceship. Insectosaurus tries to save her, but he is shot down by the ship's plasma cannons, seemingly killing him.\n\nOnboard the ship, Susan breaks free from her prison cell and furiously chases down Gallaxhar, but is trapped by a machine that extracts the quantonium from her body, shrinking her back to her normal size. Gallaxhar then uses the extracted quantonium to create [[cloning|clones]] of himself in order to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth. Monger manages to get the monsters on board the ship. They rescue Susan and make their way to the main power core where Dr. Cockroach sets the ship to self-destruct to prevent the invasion. All but Susan are trapped as the blast doors close and she personally confronts Gallaxhar on the bridge. With time running out, she sends the ball of stored quantonium down on herself, restoring her monstrous size and strength. After rescuing her friends, they flee the ship and meet with Monger and Insectosaurus, who has morphed into a giant butterfly. The ship self-destructs, killing Gallaxhar and his army.\n\nReturning to Modesto, Susan and the monsters receive a hero's welcome. Hoping to take advantage of Susan's fame for his own career, Derek tries to get back together with her, but she rejects him. Monger then arrives to tell the monsters about a new monstrous [[snail]] called \"Escargantua\" slowly making its way to [[Paris]], and the film ends with the monsters taking off to confront the new menace.\n<!-- Do not add any reference to the post-credits scene. -->\n\n==Voice cast==\n===Monsters===\n<!-- DO NOT add unsourced material and speculation (such as \"apparently\", \"evidently\", \"probably\", etc).

[[Susan Murphy]], a woman from [[Modesto, California]] who is hit by a radioactive quantonium on her wedding day, causing her to mutate and grow to a height of {{convert|49|ft|11.5|in}}. Her exposure to quantonium also makes her hair turn white and gives her super strength. <!-- Do not make a guess as to what film this character references without a cite to back it up. -->\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as B.O.B., an indestructible gelatinous mass-created when a genetically-altered tomato was injected with a chemically-altered ranch dessert topping.

He claims to have suffered several traumas in his youth, driving him to destroy his own homeworld, and plans to make a new one on Earth. \n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Gallaxhar's computer.\n\n===Humans===\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as General Warren R. Monger: A military leader who runs a top secret facility where monsters are kept, it is his plan to fight the invading aliens with the imprisoned monsters.

Not wanting to be remembered as \"the President in office when the world came to an end\", he agrees with General Monger's \"monsters vs aliens\" plan.\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Derek Dietl: A local weatherman and Susan's ex-fianc\u00e9. He jumps at whatever opportunity he has to boost his career, which causes him to place his job (and himself) before his relationship with Susan, cancelling their plans to have a romantic [[honeymoon]] in Paris to land an [[anchorman]] job in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]].\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Carl Murphy: Susan's over-emotional father.\n* [[Julie White]] as Wendy Murphy: Susan's loving mother.\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Katie: A typical human girl.

Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall monster, is a nod to the 1961 Kaiju film ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]''. According to Vernon, the Missing Link has no direct inspiration. He \"just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people.\"<ref name=NYTInspired /> For the San Francisco sequence, the producers researched lots of films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city, and filmed animator Line Andersen, who had a similar body type to Ginormica&mdash;tall, thin, and athletic-looking&mdash;walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco, to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an environment would walk around it.<ref name=MvADVD>\"Modern Movie Monster-Making\", ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' DVD</ref>\n\nEd Leonard, CTO of DreamWorks Animation, says it took approximately 45.6 million computing hours to make ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', more than eight times as many as the original ''[[Shrek]]''.
