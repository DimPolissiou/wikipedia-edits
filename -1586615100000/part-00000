The outbreak mostly took place across the [[Mississippi River Valley]]. Over the course of roughly two days, 127&nbsp;tornadoes touched down across the region, resulting in widespread damage. Nine people were killed by the tornadoes. The outbreak is best known for an F3 that struck [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], killing three people.\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nOn January 21, the [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) issued a [[Storm Prediction Center#Categories|High risk]] of severe weather across much of central and eastern Arkansas, southwestern Tennessee, northeastern Louisiana, and much of northern and western Mississippi. The organization warned of the potential for a widespread severe weather outbreak, including several long-tracked and intense tornadoes.<ref name=\"06zSPC\">{{cite web|author=John Hart|title=SPC 06z Day-1 Convective Outlook|url=http://www.convectiveoutlook.com/highrisk/19801999/99012106_spc.htm|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=Convective Outlook|date=January 21, 1999|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}</ref> The meteorological setup unfolded as a broad [[Trough (meteorology)|upper-level trough]], with its axis across the Central United States, rapidly amplified in conjunction with a 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) jet streak across the southern Rockies. Substantial height falls\u2014implying cooling in the mid layers of the atmosphere\u2014coupled with the sharpening trough allowed for strong [[Troposphere#Divergence and convergence|divergence]] to overspread the highest risk area. At the surface, a deepening [[Low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] initially centered near the Texas\u2013Oklahoma border early on January 21 deepened and accelerated eastward, reaching the Arkansas\u2013Missouri border during the overnight hours. A [[dry line]] extended southward across eastern Texas, providing increased mechanisms for rising air as it combined with a cold front and pushed eastward into Arkansas.<ref name=\"15zSPC\">{{cite web|author=Joseph A.

Substantial height falls\u2014implying cooling in the mid layers of the atmosphere\u2014coupled with the sharpening trough allowed for strong [[Troposphere#Divergence and convergence|divergence]] to overspread the highest risk area. At the surface, a deepening [[Low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] initially centered near the Texas\u2013Oklahoma border early on January 21 deepened and accelerated eastward, reaching the Arkansas\u2013Missouri border during the overnight hours.

Fauzia's older sister Nazia is married and she constantly keeps getting beaten by her husband. Fauzia keeps telling Nazia to not allow her husband to hit her which keeps enraging her brother-in-law (Nazia's husband) Fauzia is the apple of her father's eye; Fauzia's mother also loves her, however, she punishes Fauzia as Fauzia is outspoken and rebellious.\n\nFauzia's sister-in-law (Asma) is manipulative and has the complete control over her husband. Asma's brother Sajid falls in love with Fauzia and compels Asma to ask for her hand. Asma is strongly against the marriage as she does not want her brother to marry such a 'sharp' woman. Sajid manages  to convince his sister who, in turn, convinces Rahim, and that too very easily. Rahim and Asma talk to Fauzia's parents about the proposal, who are initially reluctant but finally succumb to the pressure exerted by the couple, and Sajids mother, and, eventually confirm the proposal. However, Fauzia rejects the relation firstly because Sajid was a lazy jobless person who would sit on the road all day doing nothing and also because  she has dreams of becoming famous and independent - creating a social career. Hence marrying Sajid would derail her dreams. But Fauzia's family tells her that it is too late to refuse to the marriage as the whole village has been told about it and calling off the engagement just before the wedding would ruin their reputation.\n\nFauzia, however falls in love with Abid, the owner of a cosmetic shop in her neighbourhood who recently returned from Dubai. Abid has promised to allow and help her to accomplish all her dreams and gives her many magazines of models. Fauzia tries her best to marry him and he even sends his proposal through is mother but Fauzia's mother rejects. Her wedding day with Sajid arrives but she escapes right before the ceremony.\n\nHaving no other option left, she goes to the Chaudhry and Chaudrani of the village, who help and tell her father to get Fauzia married to Abid. Fauzia and Abid, in due course, get married. However, Abid loses interest in Fauzia after their marriage. Soon, they have a son. Soon, Fauzia discovers that Abid is having an affair with Ruby, leading to conflict between Fauzia and Abid, but they reunite, but occasionally continue to fight. Fauzia wants to be a model as Abid had promised to allow her to, but after the marriage he insists her to sit at home and raise their child. Abid, also physically abuses Fauzia. Amidst his outrageous fighting he divorced Fauzia and throws her out of his house. Devastated, she leaves the village and travels to Karachi to be a model and make a career and provide for her initial family. The company she works for sends her a beautician Gogi/Rehaan (Khalid Malik) who gives her a makeover, improves her English and gives her lessons of speaking English with an accent. Meanwhile, Abid, who has divorced Fauzia, marries Ruby and gives legal custody of his child to his sister to take care for. After hearing of this news, Fauzia become depressed - and is, now, desperate to get a job and reclaim her child. Meanwhile, the company owner/boss, Gauhar introduced Fauzia to the party life of elite class. Enraged, Fauzia leaves the company as soon as she realizes this and decides to go to a woman's hostel. The caretaker of the hostel is an evil woman and seeing Fauzia for how she was, she decides to send her as an escort to a rich man's house. Fauzia realizes this when she reaches the house and meets with the rich man. Fauzia runs from there and goes back to Gogi/Rehaan [((Khalid Malik))] and starts living with him. But for many months, she does not get work. So, although reluctantly but given the circumstances, she desperately returns to the company that she was initially in, by apologizing to the boss, Gauhar. Gradually, she starts refining herself and agrees to work on Gauhar's terms, earning money. She started uploading her videos on social media and gained a lot of fan following as well as bashing and haters. After many episodes, the entry of Shehryar (Osman Khalid Butt) takes place and Fauzia and Shehryar start getting closer. Shehryar is a widower who lost his first wife and daughter in an accident few years ago and he starts falling for Fauzia's true real innocent nature. However she does not reveal about her marriage, divorce or son. Meanwhile, Fauzia's father, faces an accident which results in the cutting of one of his legs. So, Fauzia meets her family in the hospital after a very long time and pays off for all her father's hospital expenses by working however and whatever way she can. She even takes a house in the city (on rent) and shifts her family (excluding her elder brother and his wife) to the city for some days until her father gets a new leg fixed at a private hospital in the city. Meanwhile, she gets close to her family and also provides them with all the amenities which were not available in the village. She also lends money to her elder brother, just to pay - off his rent and other debts and to maintain a cordial relationship with him. Moreover, Shehryar gives a diamond ring to Fauzia and proposes to her in an indirect manner. Initially she agrees but she refuses when she thinks herself as unworthy of his love. However, she gradually realizes that agreeing to marry him would result in her getting a safe exit from the world of glamour. She agrees to marry him. Overjoyed, Shehryar takes Fauzia to his house and makes his mother meet Fauzia. Her life seemed to get calm when all of a sudden a breaking news is shared on television channels which mentions her real name (Fauzia, instead of Kanwal) and reveals the details of her past including her marriage and child. The TV channels also showed interview of her ex-husband who twisted the facts and stated that she ran away from his house on the pretext of working in media and did n0t even care about her infant son. The son who was now a few years of age, had completely no memory of his mother and hence agreed to what his father had fed him against his mother. This broke Fauzia's heart very badly since she did not expect to be hated by her own son and that, too on baseless lies. On the other hand, Sheheryar feels hurt on finding out the truth in this way. However his mother tells him to give Fauzia at least a chance to tell her side of the story. On hearing the truth from her own mouth, Shehryar's affection and respect for Fauzia increases and he promises to never leave her and assured her that one day he will help her bring back her son because his daughter was dead but her son was alive. They happily decide to start the wedding preparations and she meanwhile decides to pay a final visit to her parents' house.\n\nThe media breaking her past story also became the cause of her own family including her parents and siblings finding out her job and they were all extremely angry at her since Fauzia had previously told them that she earned her money by working on a boutique. However, when she visits them and informs them of her decision to marry Shehryar, their anger starts to subside. However, her younger brother, who now had become a drug addict, was mocked by his friends and peers for having such a reckless sister who was bringing shame to the name of their family. He drugs her and then strangles her in her semi- conscious state. Fauzia's whole life flashes in front of her eyes as she makes frail attempts to free herself. Eventually she dies and her brother runs away. Next morning her younger sister finds her dead body in the room. The news soon spreads like wildfire and media breaks the news which ultimately reaches Sheheryar as well who is numb with grief. Fauzia's brother is arrested by police and Fauzia's father cried helplessly on his daughter's murder. He initially did not want to forgive his son however he reluctantly had to give in to his elder son and Fauzia's mother's plea. A woman is shown visiting Fauzia's father who, after paying condolences, asks for his permission to make a documentary on Fauzia's life. He gives the permission and as a token of thanks, the lady hands him over an envelope containing money which he later hands over to Fauzia's mother saying Fauzia sent that money. The last scene of the drama shows Shehryar sitting on Fauzia's grave and recalling all the good times he had spent with her since the time he had first met her. He remembers how once, she had mentioned to him about her love for red roses, adding as a joke to bring two dozen red flowers to her grave in case she dies. He had hushed away her joke but she in her carefree mood, had made him promise to do that. Pulling himself out of the flashback, a teary eyed Shehryar puts a bouquet of two dozen red roses on her grave and leaves.\nThe end of the drama shows a burning candle with Fauzia's voice in the background, addressing society, stating that she had left the world, however good or bad she was. She adds that the society snatched away her any chances of redemption. She questions in the end whether the society was pure now, after killing her.

Fauzia's older sister Nazia is married and she constantly keeps getting beaten by her husband. Fauzia keeps telling Nazia to not allow her husband to hit her which keeps enraging her brother-in-law (Nazia's husband) Fauzia is the apple of her father's eye; Fauzia's mother also loves her, however, she punishes Fauzia as Fauzia is outspoken and rebellious.\n\nFauzia's sister-in-law (Asma) is manipulative and has the complete control over her husband. Asma's brother Sajid falls in love with Fauzia and compels Asma to ask for her hand. Asma is strongly against the marriage as she does not want her brother to marry such a 'sharp' woman. Sajid manages  to convince his sister who, in turn, convinces Rahim, and that too very easily. Rahim and Asma talk to Fauzia's parents about the proposal, who are initially reluctant but finally succumb to the pressure exerted by the couple, and Sajids mother, and, eventually confirm the proposal. However, Fauzia rejects the relation firstly because Sajid was a lazy jobless person who would sit on the road all day doing nothing and also because  she has dreams of becoming famous and independent - creating a social career. Hence marrying Sajid would derail her dreams. But Fauzia's family tells her that it is too late to refuse to the marriage as the whole village has been told about it and calling off the engagement just before the wedding would ruin their reputation.\n\nFauzia, however falls in love with Abid, the owner of a cosmetic shop in her neighbourhood who recently returned from Dubai. Abid has promised to allow and help her to accomplish all her dreams and gives her many magazines of models. Fauzia tries her best to marry him and he even sends his proposal through is mother but Fauzia's mother rejects. Her wedding day with Sajid arrives but she escapes right before the ceremony.\n\nHaving no other option left, she goes to the Chaudhry and Chaudrani of the village, who help and tell her father to get Fauzia married to Abid. Fauzia and Abid, in due course, get married. However, Abid loses interest in Fauzia after their marriage. Soon, they have a son. Soon, Fauzia discovers that Abid is having an affair with Ruby, leading to conflict between Fauzia and Abid, but they reunite, but occasionally continue to fight. Fauzia wants to be a model as Abid had promised to allow her to, but after the marriage he insists her to sit at home and raise their child. Abid, also physically abuses Fauzia. Amidst his outrageous fighting he divorced Fauzia and throws her out of his house. Devastated, she leaves the village and travels to Karachi to be a model and make a career and provide for her initial family. The company she works for sends her a beautician Gogi/Rehaan (Khalid Malik) who gives her a makeover, improves her English and gives her lessons of speaking English with an accent. Meanwhile, Abid, who has divorced Fauzia, marries Ruby and gives legal custody of his child to his sister to take care for. After hearing of this news, Fauzia become depressed - and is, now, desperate to get a job and reclaim her child. Meanwhile, the company owner/boss, Gauhar introduced Fauzia to the party life of elite class. Enraged, Fauzia leaves the company as soon as she realizes this and decides to go to a woman's hostel. The caretaker of the hostel is an evil woman and seeing Fauzia for how she was, she decides to send her as an escort to a rich man's house. Fauzia realizes this when she reaches the house and meets with the rich man. Fauzia runs from there and goes back to Gogi/Rehaan [((Khalid Malik))] and starts living with him. But for many months, she does not get work. So, although reluctantly but given the circumstances, she desperately returns to the company that she was initially in, by apologizing to the boss, Gauhar. Gradually, she starts refining herself and agrees to work on Gauhar's terms, earning money. She started uploading her videos on social media and gained a lot of fan following as well as bashing and haters. After many episodes, the entry of Shehryar (Osman Khalid Butt) takes place and Fauzia and Shehryar start getting closer. Shehryar is a widower who lost his first wife and daughter in an accident few years ago and he starts falling for Fauzia's true real innocent nature. However she does not reveal about her marriage, divorce or son. Meanwhile, Fauzia's father, faces an accident which results in the cutting of one of his legs. So, Fauzia meets her family in the hospital after a very long time and pays off for all her father's hospital expenses by working however and whatever way she can. She even takes a house in the city (on rent) and shifts her family (excluding her elder brother and his wife) to the city for some days until her father gets a new leg fixed at a private hospital in the city. Meanwhile, she gets close to her family and also provides them with all the amenities which were not available in the village. She also lends money to her elder brother, just to pay - off his rent and other debts and to maintain a cordial relationship with him. Moreover, Shehryar gives a diamond ring to Fauzia and proposes to her in an indirect manner. Initially she agrees but she refuses when she thinks herself as unworthy of his love. However, she gradually realizes that agreeing to marry him would result in her getting a safe exit from the world of glamour. She agrees to marry him. Overjoyed, Shehryar takes Fauzia to his house and makes his mother meet Fauzia. Her life seemed to get calm when all of a sudden a breaking news is shared on television channels which mentions her real name (Fauzia, instead of Kanwal) and reveals the details of her past including her marriage and child. The TV channels also showed interview of her ex-husband who twisted the facts and stated that she ran away from his house on the pretext of working in media and did n0t even care about her infant son. The son who was now a few years of age, had completely no memory of his mother and hence agreed to what his father had fed him against his mother. This broke Fauzia's heart very badly since she did not expect to be hated by her own son and that, too on baseless lies. On the other hand, Sheheryar feels hurt on finding out the truth in this way. However his mother tells him to give Fauzia at least a chance to tell her side of the story. On hearing the truth from her own mouth, Shehryar's affection and respect for Fauzia increases and he promises to never leave her and assured her that one day he will help her bring back her son because his daughter was dead but her son was alive. They happily decide to start the wedding preparations and she meanwhile decides to pay a final visit to her parents' house.\n\nThe media breaking her past story also became the cause of her own family including her parents and siblings finding out her job and they were all extremely angry at her since Fauzia had previously told them that she earned her money by working on a boutique. However, when she visits them and informs them of her decision to marry Shehryar, their anger starts to subside. However, her younger brother, who now had become a drug addict, was mocked by his friends and peers for having such a reckless sister who was bringing shame to the name of their family. He drugs her and then strangles her in her semi- conscious state. Fauzia's whole life flashes in front of her eyes as she makes frail attempts to free herself. Eventually she dies and her brother runs away. Next morning her younger sister finds her dead body in the room. The news soon spreads like wildfire and media breaks the news which ultimately reaches Sheheryar as well who is numb with grief. Fauzia's brother is arrested by police and Fauzia's father cried helplessly on his daughter's murder. He initially did not want to forgive his son however he reluctantly had to give in to his elder son and Fauzia's mother's plea. A woman is shown visiting Fauzia's father who, after paying condolences, asks for his permission to make a documentary on Fauzia's life. He gives the permission and as a token of thanks, the lady hands him over an envelope containing money which he later hands over to Fauzia's mother saying Fauzia sent that money. The last scene of the drama shows Shehryar sitting on Fauzia's grave and recalling all the good times he had spent with her since the time he had first met her. He remembers how once, she had mentioned to him about her love for red roses, adding as a joke to bring two dozen red flowers to her grave in case she dies. He had hushed away her joke but she in her carefree mood, had made him promise to do that. Pulling himself out of the flashback, a teary eyed Shehryar puts a bouquet of two dozen red roses on her grave and leaves.\nThe end of the drama shows a burning candle with Fauzia's voice in the background, addressing society, stating that she had left the world, however good or bad she was. She adds that the society snatched away her any chances of redemption. She questions in the end whether the society was pure now, after killing her. The candle is blown off.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Saba Qamar]] as Fauzia Batool/Kanwal Baloch\n*[[Osman Khalid Butt]] as Shehreyar (Kanwal's love interest)\n*[[Khalid Malik]] as Rehaan (Kanwal's best friend)\n*[[Ali Kazmi]] as Abid (Fauzia's husband) \n*[[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Raheem (Fauzia's elder brother)\n*[[Irfan Khoosat]] as Fauzia's father\n*[[Saba Faisal (actress)|Saba Faisal]] as Fauzia's mother\n*[[Nimra Khan]] as Munni Fauzia's younger sister \n*[[Nadia Afgan]] as Asma (Fauzia's sister-in-law)\n*[[Seemi Raheel]] as Abid's mother\n*Syed Tabrez Ali Shah as Munna Fauzia's younger brother\n*Syed Babrik Shah\n*[[Laila Zuberi]] as Shehreyar's mother\n*[[Mani (actor)|Mani]]\n*Tahir Jatoi\n*Sophia Mirza\n*Tahir Latif Saqi\n*Nishoo\n*Farhana Maqsood as Abid's second wife\n*Farah Tufail\n*Muskan Jay as Abid's sister\n*Rabia Abid Ali (Noreen)\n*Imran Ali Sheikh\n*Raja Matloob\n*Fahad Sherwani\n*Usman Mazhar\n*Ali Deswali\n*Amna Karim\n*Mahrukh Rizvi\n*Wahaj Khan\n*Salma Shaheen\n*Mehboob Sultan\n*Urooj Abbas\n*Anees Alam\n*Omair Ali Bhutto\n*Abdullah Malik\n*Meerub Shahid\n*Muhammad Subhan\n*Sunaina Shehzad\n*Ali Saqi\n*Bahawal Tofeeq\n*Ibrahim Tariq \n*Munawar noor\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* [[Yasir Hussain]] as [[Sohail Warraich]]\n* [[Yasir Nawaz]]\n* Ali Saqi \n* [[Hareem Farooq]] as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* [[Goher Mumtaz]] as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* Nomi Ansari as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* [[Hira Tareen]]\n* [[Naeem Tahir]]\n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Chaudhrani Ji\n* Ahmed Godil\n* Hasan Soomro\n* [[Farooq Rind]]\n* Amna Karim\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

It broadcasts 86.5 hours of programmes daily on its national and satellite channels.\n\nThe First channel, Radio Skopje, broadcasts a continuous 24-hour programme. It mainly functions as a [[talk radio]].\n\nThe Second channel, Radio 2, broadcasts a continuous 24-hour programme, too. It is focused on popular music and entertainment.\n\nThe Third channel of Radio Skopje, broadcasts programmes in all the languages of the national minorities in North Macedonia, including [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (since 1948); [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (since 1945) 5 hours; [[Aromanian language|Vlach]] (since 1991); [[Romani language|Romany]] (since 1991); [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (since 2003) and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] (since 2003) all 30 minutes each per day.\n\nThe satellite channel, Radio Macedonia, commenced in July 2003, and broadcasts a 24-hour continual programme, which is a selection of programmes from Macedonian Radio and its original programme \"Radio Macedonia\" with a duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nKanal 103 provides FM broadcasting only for the region of [[Skopje]] with the mission of promoting [[avantgarde music|avant-garde music]] and culture.\n\nMacedonian Radio also broadcasts its programme over the Internet.\n\n==History==\nRadio in Vardar Macedonia began in 1941, when Skopje was administrative capital of [[Vardar Banovina]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. On 27 January 1941 ''Radio Skoplje'' (''\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0459\u0435'') started broadcasting in Serbian and retransmitting some programs from [[Radio Belgrade]]. On 20 April 1941 Radio Skopje was relaunched under [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgarian control]] as ''Radio Skopie'' (''\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0435''), retransmitting some programs from [[Bulgarian National Radio|Radio Sofia]].\n\nBroadcasting in the [[Macedonian language]] began on 28 December 1944 as ''Radio Skopje'' (''\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043fj\u0435'') with the live transmission of the Second Session of [[ASNOM]]. Since 1991 Macedonian Radio and Television is independent radio and television broadcaster. In July 1993, MRT was admitted as a full active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. MRT uses the acronym: MKRTV. With the enactment of the new broadcasting law on 24 April 1997, Macedonian Radio and Television was split into two parts: Macedonian radio-diffusion and Macedonian Radio-Television. According to article 77 of the broadcasting law, 61% of the collected [[television licence|broadcasting tax]] belongs to Macedonian Radio Television.\n\n==Management==\n\nThe process of transformation of MRTV in a [[public service broadcaster]] is not yet completed; it entailed the 1997 Law on Broadcasting Activities and the 2005 Broadcast Law. Editorial independence of MRTV is guaranteed by law but de facto lacking due to lack of independent funding and lack of independence of MRTV managerial bodies.

The station also broadcasts to Australia & New Zealand through the [[Optus D2]] Satellite via [[UBI World TV]].\n*[[MRT 2 Sat]] was introduced in 2012 and broadcasts a continuous 24-hour programme in Albanian language.\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:SkopjeMTV.jpg|thumbnail|Macedonian Radio-Television building in Skopje]]\n\nThe framework of the Macedonian Radio consists of three national channels, a satellite channel and a non-profit regional channel. It broadcasts 86.5 hours of programmes daily on its national and satellite channels.\n\nThe First channel, Radio Skopje, broadcasts a continuous 24-hour programme. It mainly functions as a [[talk radio]].\n\nThe Second channel, Radio 2, broadcasts a continuous 24-hour programme, too. It is focused on popular music and entertainment.\n\nThe Third channel of Radio Skopje, broadcasts programmes in all the languages of the national minorities in North Macedonia, including [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (since 1948); [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (since 1945) 5 hours; [[Aromanian language|Vlach]] (since 1991); [[Romani language|Romany]] (since 1991); [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (since 2003) and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] (since 2003) all 30 minutes each per day.\n\nThe satellite channel, Radio Macedonia, commenced in July 2003, and broadcasts a 24-hour continual programme, which is a selection of programmes from Macedonian Radio and its original programme \"Radio Macedonia\" with a duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nKanal 103 provides FM broadcasting only for the region of [[Skopje]] with the mission of promoting [[avantgarde music|avant-garde music]] and culture.\n\nMacedonian Radio also broadcasts its programme over the Internet.\n\n==History==\nRadio in Vardar Macedonia began in 1941, when Skopje was administrative capital of [[Vardar Banovina]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. On 27 January 1941 ''Radio Skoplje'' (''\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0459\u0435'') started broadcasting in Serbian and retransmitting some programs from [[Radio Belgrade]]. On 20 April 1941 Radio Skopje was relaunched under [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgarian control]] as ''Radio Skopie'' (''\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0435''), retransmitting some programs from [[Bulgarian National Radio|Radio Sofia]].\n\nBroadcasting in the [[Macedonian language]] began on 28 December 1944 as ''Radio Skopje'' (''\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043fj\u0435'') with the live transmission of the Second Session of [[ASNOM]]. Since 1991 Macedonian Radio and Television is independent radio and television broadcaster. In July 1993, MRT was admitted as a full active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. MRT uses the acronym: MKRTV. With the enactment of the new broadcasting law on 24 April 1997, Macedonian Radio and Television was split into two parts: Macedonian radio-diffusion and Macedonian Radio-Television. According to article 77 of the broadcasting law, 61% of the collected [[television licence|broadcasting tax]] belongs to Macedonian Radio Television.\n\n==Management==\n\nThe process of transformation of MRTV in a [[public service broadcaster]] is not yet completed; it entailed the 1997 Law on Broadcasting Activities and the 2005 Broadcast Law. Editorial independence of MRTV is guaranteed by law but de facto lacking due to lack of independent funding and lack of independence of MRTV managerial bodies. MRTV executive directors in the last ten years remained close to the party in power. The network is funded by a license fee as well as by public budget contributions and advertising revenues (limited to 10% of airtime).

Portable stoves can be used in diverse situations, such as for outdoor food service and [[catering]]<ref>S. Shiring, et al., \"Introduction to Catering: Ingredients for Success\", p. 33 (Cengage Learning 2001)</ref> and in [[field hospital]]s.<ref>W. Keen, ed. \"Surgery, Its Principles and Practice\", p.122 (W.B. Saunders 1921)</ref>\n\nSince the invention of the portable stove in the 19th century, a wide variety of designs and models have seen use in a number of different applications. Portable stoves can be broken down into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and stove design: unpressurized stoves that use solid or liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition; stoves that use a volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner; bottled gas stoves; and gravity-fed \"spirit\" stoves.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early example===\n[[File:Japanese Shichirin HIbachi Conro.JPG|thumb|Various Japanese traditional shichirin]]\nThe [[shichirin]], a lightweight charcoal stove, has been used in [[Japan]] in much the same form since at least the [[Edo period]] (1603-1868).<ref>[http://www.city.onojo.fukuoka.jp/library/kyouiku/rekisi/shuppan/minzoku-14.pdf \u300c\u5927\u91ce\u57ce\u5e02\u6b74\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u5c55\u793a\u5ba4\u89e3\u8aac\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u6c11\u4fd7No.14\u3000\u6c11\u5177\uff11\uff08\u98df\u751f\u6d3b\u306b\u304b\u304b\u308f\u308b\u6c11\u5177\uff09\u300d\u5927\u91ce\u57ce\u5e02\u6559\u80b2\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002131505/http://www.city.onojo.fukuoka.jp/library/kyouiku/rekisi/shuppan/minzoku-14.pdf |date=2011-10-02 }}</ref> Old shichirin are mainly [[ceramic]] and many can be found in old houses.

The shape is mainly cylindrical, square, or rectangular, and the size also varies. Many varieties of shichirin are made for different uses. In [[North America]], they are also known as \"[[hibachi]]\" or \"hibachi-style\".<ref>[http://www.excite.co.jp/News/bit/00091117673827.html \u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u300cHibachi\u300d\u306f\u706b\u9262\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f] excite\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 2005\u5e746\u67082\u65e5</ref>\n\nEarly European portable stoves burned animal fat and polar explorers continued to use blubber as a supplement for cooking fuel into the early 20th Century.\n\n===Modern era===\nModern portable stoves emerged from the mid-19th century. French-born [[chef]], [[Alexis Soyer]], became ''chef de cuisine'' at the [[Reform Club]] in London from 1837. He instituted many innovations, including cooking with gas, refrigerators cooled by cold water, and ovens with adjustable temperatures. In 1849 Soyer began to market his portable \"magic stove\" which allowed people to cook food wherever they were. The design of Soyer's \"Magic Stove\" was based on the same principle as a [[kerosene lamp]], in which a wick is used to draw fuel from a tank or reservoir to a burner.<ref>A. Soyer, \"The Modern Housewife Or M\u00e9nag\u00e8re: Comprising Nearly One Thousand Recipes for the Economic and Judicious Preparation of Every Meal of the Day, and Those for the Nursery and Sick Room: with Minute Directions for Family Management in All Its Branches\", pp. 451-52 (Simpkin, Marshall & Co. 1851)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Soyer Stove.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Alexis Soyer]]'s \"Magic Stove\", used by British troops during the [[Crimean War]]<ref>{{cite book | title = The Modern Housewife: Or, M\u00e9nag\u00e8re.

Later he was paid his expenses and wages equivalent to those of a Brigadier-General. He designed his own field stove, the Soyer Stove, and trained and installed in every regiment the \"Regimental cook\" so that soldiers would get an adequate meal and not suffer from malnutrition or die of food poisoning. Catering standards within the [[British Army]] would remain inconsistent, however, and there would not be a single [[Army Catering Corps]] until 1945. This is now part of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]], whose catering HQ is called Soyer's House. His stove, or adaptions of it, remained in British military service into the late 20th century.\n\nIn the 1850s, the famous [[Alps|Alpine]] [[mountaineer]] [[Francis Fox Tuckett]] developed an alcohol stove for campers and mountaineers known as the \"Russian furnace.\" It was also known as the \"Rob Roy,\" after [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]], the renowned canoeist who was nicknamed \"Rob Roy.\" MacGregor's 1866 book, \"A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe\" was an international success and described his camping methods.<ref>Invisible on Everest; Innovation and the Gear Makers, p.75</ref> Tuckett's stove and integral cook kit was designed to hang from a cord in the interior of a tent.<ref>Alpine Journal Vo. 2, 1866, page 10</ref>\n\n[[Fridtjof Nansen]] also developed an alcohol stove in the 1880s based on the work of [[Adolphus Greely]]. This improved on early designs and later became the basis for the [[Trangia]] cooker.<ref>Invisible on Everest; Innovation and the Gear Makers, p.33</ref>\n\n[[File:Svea fotogenk\u00f6k.jpg|thumb|left|Early portable kerosene stove]]\n[[Carl Richard Nyberg]] invented the blowtorch in 1882 and began manufacturing Primus stoves a decade later.<ref>Invisible on Everest; Innovation and the Gear Makers, p.35</ref> The first model, called ''Viktoria'', was not very successful, but the later ''Svea'' did better.<ref name=museet>[http://www.museet.se/historik/persona/nyberg/index.htm Sundbybergs Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529202847/http://www.museet.se/historik/persona/nyberg/index.htm |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>  Other sources credit [[Frans W Lindqvist]] for the same thing at the same time.\n\nThe use of single burner alcohol stoves for camping, similar to the contemporary [[Trangia]] brand, was reported as early as 1919.<ref>E. Morris, \"The Rainy Day in Camp\", in Outing Magazine p. 231 (July 1919)</ref> For many years alcohol-based stoves were used on sailboats rather than stoves using kerosene for safety reasons; these have since been largely replaced by stoves using compressed gas (such as [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[butane]] or propane) in disposable or refillable canisters.<ref>J. Smith, \"Kitchen Afloat: Galley Management and Meal Preparation\", pp.47-49 (Sheridan House 2002)</ref> Stoves designed for [[military]] use, such as the [[World War II]]-era [[G.I. Pocket Stove]], were designed to run on [[gasoline]].  So-called \"[[white gas]]\" or [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]] is commonly used as a fuel for camping and backpacking stoves, such as the compact [[Svea 123]]. Newer camping stoves are capable of burning multiple types of fuel, which makes them well suited for international travel where some particular types of fuel may not be readily available.<ref>M. Mouland, \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Camping and Hiking\", p. 324 (Alpha Books 1999)</ref>\n\nThe use of lightweight portable stoves for camping became commonplace in Britain and Europe in the latter half of the 19th Century. The practice gained acceptance later in North America, and coincided with increased awareness of the environmental impact that campers backpackers had on the areas where they travelled.\n\nPrior to their use, the usual practice when backpacking was to build an open fire for cooking from available materials such as fallen branches. The fire scar left on the ground would remain for two or three years before the vegetation recovered. The accumulation of fire scars in heavily travelled areas detracted from the pristine appearance that backpackers expected, leading to more widespread use of portable stoves.\n\n==Uses==\nStoves differ widely in their size and portability. The smallest models are generally termed ''backpacking stoves''. They are designed for use in [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] and [[bicycle touring]], where light weight and small size are paramount considerations. Backpacking stoves consist only of the burner, fuel tank and pot supports. The legs&nbsp;\u2013 if any&nbsp;\u2013 are often collapsible to minimize the space required. The weight may range from about 1 to 2 [[ounce]]s (30 to 60 g) for simple alcohol stoves, {{convert|11|to|14|oz}} for MSR-type stoves (without fuel weight) and canister stoves (with gas cartridge), and up to {{convert|1|lb}} for larger stoves.<ref>C. Fletcher, \"The Complete Walker III: The Joys and Techniques of Hiking and Backpacking\", p. 229 (Knopf 1984)</ref> Single burner alcohol stoves, beverage can stoves, and small liquid fuel and gas canister stoves are well suited for backpacking.\n\n''Camping stoves'' are designed for use by people travelling by [[automobile|car]], [[boat]], [[canoe]], or on [[horseback riding|horseback]]. They are similar in function and ease of use to kitchen stovetops, usually with two burners set into a table-like surface, and often with a folding lid for stowage and wind protection. This increases the weight accordingly.<ref>B. McKeown, \"Start Camping the Easy Way&nbsp;\u2013 By Car\", in Popular Mechanics Magazine, at p. 102 (March 1976)</ref>\n\n== Unpressurized liquid-fuel stoves ==\n[[File:Trangia-Burner-MJC01.jpg|thumb|[[Trangia]] single-burner alcohol stove with cap and lid]]\n[[File:Canstove.jpg|thumb|left|A homemade soda can stove]]\n\n=== Single burner alcohol stoves{{anchor|alcohol stove}} ===\n\nThe simplest type of stove is an unpressurized single burner design, in which the burner contains the [[fuel]] and which once lit burns until it is either extinguished or the fuel is exhausted. There are both liquid- and solid-fuel stoves of this variety. Because they are extremely small and lightweight, this type of stove tends to be favored by [[ultralight backpacking|ultralight backpackers]] as well as those seeking to minimize weight and bulk, particularly for extended backpacking trips. Solid-fuel stoves are also commonly used in emergency kits both because they are compact and the fuel is very stable over time.<ref>J. McCann, \"Build the Perfect Survival Kit: Custom Kits for Adventure, Sport, Travel\", p.54 (Krause Publications 2005)</ref> These simple stoves are also commonly used when serving [[fondue]].\n\nThe [[Trangia]] stove is a popular commercial [[alcohol]] stove, which is available in many different models, from a single bare burner to an integrated expedition cooking system. Some of these come with a sealing cover, allowing the burner to be packed while still containing fuel, although putting the lid on while the stove is hot can damage the O ring seal (hence it may leak in transit). An even simpler system is the [[Sterno]] heater, in which the can that contains a jellied fuel also serves as the burner. Homemade [[beverage can stove]]s (or \"Pepsi/beer/etc. can stoves\") are similar. These are made from discarded aluminium [[beverage can]]s, and come in a wide variety of different designs.\n\n=== Gravity-fed spirit stoves ===\n[[File:Spirit stove on yacht.jpg|thumb|Two-burner spirit stove, with far burner on low heat]]\n\nThe traditional \"spirit stove\" (alcohol or [[methylated spirits]]) consists of a small reservoir or fuel tank raised above and to the side of the burner. The fuel tank supplies the methylated spirits under gravity to the burner, where it is vaporized and burned.\nThe gravity-fed spirit stove is still found in many pleasure boats, although it has largely been replaced by compressed gas stoves.<ref>G. Buehler, \"The Troller Yacht Book\", p. 99 (W. W. Norton & Co. 1999)</ref>\n\nLighting a gravity-fed spirit stove is similar to lighting a traditional Primus stove. Around each burner is a priming pan used to preheat the burner. To light the stove, the burner is first turned on to allow a small amount of fuel to pass through the burner and collect as a liquid in the priming pan. The burner is then turned off, and the fuel ignited to preheat the burner. When the fuel in the pan is almost all gone, the burner is turned on again, and fuel passes into the burner where it is vaporized and passes through the jets.\n\nThese stoves look and even sound a bit like pressurized burner stoves, but the fuel tank is under no pressure. They remain popular for small boats owing to the minimal fire risk they pose in a confined space.\n\n=== Wicking stoves ===\n{{See also|Kerosene lamp|Kerosene heater}}\nWicking stoves are typically fueled by alcohol or kerosene.\n* ORIGO alcohol stove\n*[[Project Gaia#The CleanCook Stove|Project Gaia\u00a7The CleanCook Stove]]\n*Butterfly 16-Wick Kerosene Cook Stove\n\n==== Platinum Catalysis stove ====\n{{See also|Catalytic heater}}\n[[Humphry Davy]] discovered the use of platinum in [[catalysis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bond|first=Alexander Russell|title=Scientific American Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X803AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA251|year=1921|publisher=Scientific American Publishing Company|pages=251\u2013|quote=Producing Heat by Catalysis (Translated for the ''Scientific American Monthly'' from ''La Nature'' (Paris), December 25, 1920. - Flameless Stove Used by the French Army During the War - By R.

Lindqvist's stove was based on the pressurized [[blowtorch]] but fitted with an upturned burner assembly of his own design. Together with partner J.V. Svensson, Lindqvist established the [[Primus AB|Primus]] brand of stove, which quickly developed into a worldwide market leader.\n\nThe kerosene burning [[Primus stove]]s and their imitators were made of brass and were a significant advance over previous designs, which had used a wick to supply liquid fuel to the burner by capillary action. The Primus burner vaporized the fuel in a loop of pipe which rose up from the fuel tank at the stove's base, and which was pre-heated with alcohol (or \"[[methylated spirits]]\") before being combusted in the burner. Initial pressure is provided by a small, hand-operated pump integrated into the stove's fuel tank. The flame on a Primus stove is adjusted by using the pump to increase the pressure in the tank to make the flame larger, or by venting the tank to reduce the pressure and make the flame smaller. Later models used a separate valve to adjust the flame. Primus-style stoves were made in a variety of sizes and styles, and many were designed to be disassembled for storage and transportation in a separate case.<ref>Primus Catalog, p.8 (1903)</ref>\n\n=== Compact camping and hiking stoves ===\n[[File:MSR Patent Model 9-XGK Stove.jpg|thumb|Patent drawing of MSR XGK stove]]\n[[File:PortableGasolineStove PreHeat.jpg|thumb|Pre-heats MSR WhisperliteInternational]]\n\nSmaller, more compact stoves were developed in the early 20th century that used [[petrol]] (gasoline),<ref>Primus Catalog No. 8126, p. 17 (undated; circa 1935)</ref> which at that time was similar to so-called [[white gas]] and did not have the additives and other constituents contained in [[gasoline additive|modern gasoline]]. Similar in design to the kerosene-burning Primus-style stove, the smaller white gas stove was also made of brass with the fuel tank at the base and the burner assembly at the top. Unlike the Primus-style stove, however, priming both pressurizes the tank and pre-heats the burner assembly in this type of stove. Once lit, the heat from the burner maintains the pressure in the tank until the flame is extinguished. The [[Svea 123]], introduced in 1955, is among the most popular of these \"self pressurizing\" stove designs, and is generally considered to be the first compact camping stove. [[Optimus of Sweden]] manufactures a line of similarly designed stoves in which the stove's components are entirely enclosed in a folding metal case, the most popular of which were the Optimus 8R and 111 (still in production as the [http://www.optimus.se/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=34 Optimus Hiker]).  The [[Coleman Company]] developed a small white gas stove with integral fuel tank for the US Army in [[World War II]], the \"[[GI pocket stove]]\".  Coleman still makes similar stoves, such as the 442, 533 and 550B (the latter of which can also run on kerosene).  These stoves have a pump to build up initial pressure in the fuel tank, but are generally self-pressurising when running (occasional re-pumping may be necessary if the stove is run at full output).\n\nIn the early 1970s [[Mountain Safety Research]] (MSR) designed a pressurized burner stove intended to address performance shortcomings of white gas stoves in cold or adverse conditions, in particular for [[mountaineering]] use.<ref>Backpacker Magazine, p. 138 (May 1998)</ref> First introduced in 1973 and designated the Model 9 (and later as the XGK Expedition), the MSR stove had four main parts: a free-standing burner assembly with integrated pot supports; the fuel bottle, which doubles as the stove's fuel tank; a pump that screws into the bottle; and a flexible tube or pipeline connecting the pump/bottle assembly to the burner assembly.<ref>H. Manning, \"Backpacking: One Step At A Time\", p.274 (Vintage Books 1980)</ref> This type of stove design, with the \"outboard\" fuel tank held away from the burner, is primed in the same manner as other white gas stoves; however, because the tank is not self-pressurizing, the tank must periodically be pumped to maintain pressure to the burner. Most commercial liquid fuel camping stoves on the market today are of this design.\n\nPressurized burner stoves are now available that can burn several different fuels or volatile liquids, including alcohol, gasoline or other motor fuels, kerosene, and jet propellant. Little or no modification is needed; due to variability of the volatility of different fuels, the jets of multi-fuel stoves may need to be changed for the different fuels,<ref>K. Berger & R. Hildebrand, \"Advanced Backpacking: A Trailside Guide\", p. 183 (W. W. Norton & Co. 1998)</ref>, and many others.\n\n=== Coiled burner stoves ===\n\nThe \"coiled burner\" stove is a variant on the pressurized burner design, in which the burner assembly consists of a coiled loop with a small hole in the lower part, through which the vaporized fuel exits and combusts. Generally small, lightweight and cheaply made, these were sold under the brand name \"Stesco\", \"Tay-Kit\",<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA107&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Camp Stove Fits Pocket.\"] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 107, right-top page</ref> \"Handy Camper\" and others. A more substantial version of the coiled burner stove is the Swiss made [[Borde stove]].\n\n=== Gas cartridge stoves ===\n[[File:Primus stove.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A gas cartridge camping stove]]\n\nThe design of most portable gas cartridge stoves is similar to that of many pressurized burner stoves, except the fuel tank or [[EN 417|cartridge]] contains a liquefied gas&nbsp;\u2013 typically [[butane]], [[propane]] or a mixture of hydrocarbons&nbsp;\u2013 that is held under pressure. While the gas in the cartridge is in a liquid state when stored under pressure, it vaporizes immediately as it leaves the storage bottle (i.e., without priming), arriving at the burner as a gas. The principal advantage of gas cartridge stoves is convenience: no priming is required, they are generally maintenance-free and capable of immediate high heat output, the flame is easily adjusted and they are generally considered simpler to operate.<ref>Backpacker Magazine, p. 56 (March 1994)</ref> There are two basic designs for most gas cartridge stoves used for camping: the burner assembly is fitted into the top of the gas cartridge, which serves as the stove's base, or the stove is free-standing and the cartridge is separated from the burner and connected by means of a small hose or pipe.<ref>D. Getchell, \"Gas Pains\", in Backpacker Magazine, p. 101 (April 1994)</ref> Single burner propane stoves commonly used in food service have the gas container integrated into the body of the stove. Butane cartridges are almost exclusively manufactured in [[South Korea]] with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas. Butane canisters manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills canisters with domestic butane.<ref>http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Houston-businessman-overcame-hardships-of-Chinese-8313857.php</ref>\n\n[[File:Iwatani Cassette Feu Tatsujin 01.jpg|thumb|Gas cartridge stove]]\n\nGas cartridges for camping stoves tend to be costly and usually are not refillable. Single-use cartridges are considered objectionable by some on environmental grounds. They perform poorly in cold weather.<ref>C. Townsend, \"The Advanced Backpacker: A Handbook of Year-Round, Long-Distance Hiking\", p. 164 (McGraw-Hill 2000)</ref> Until the approval of [[EN 417|EN 417-specification Lindal valve cartridges]] of 1992 there was little compatibility between different makers and systems, and cartridges for older cartridge stoves were often unobtainable. Outside of camping, single-burner stoves using cans of compressed butane gas are used for catering and other food service applications.<ref>J. Weinberg, \"The Everything Guide to Starting and Running a Catering Business: Insider's Advice on Turning Your Talent Into a Career\", p. 144 (Everything Books 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Coleman stove.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Coleman white gas camp stove]]\n\nRefillable gas bottles are heavier, and tend to be used on larger stoves intended for car camping, expedition base camps, and residential use (as for [[barbecue]]s).\n\n=== Multiple burner stoves ===\n\nStoves with two or more burners that may be operated together or separately are common for use in base camp, car camping and other situations involving cooking for larger groups. The folding \"suitcase\" style by [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] is the best known of this design, and is intended to be used on a flat, stable surface such as a tabletop. This type of stove may have a separate fuel tank for each burner, or more commonly a single tank shared by both burners. Multiple burner stoves generally use compressed gas, alcohol or [[Naphtha]] (also known as [[White gas]] or [[Coleman fuel]]).<ref>M. Rutter, \"Camping Made Easy\", pp. 61-62 (Globe Pequot 2001)</ref>\n\n== Solid-fuel stoves ==\n[[File:Pocket-size collapsible cooker.jpg|thumb|Esbit stove with box of fuel tablets]]\n\nA solid-fuel stove may consist of no more than a metal base plate and container to hold the fuel, a set of legs to keep this assembly out of contact with the ground, and some supports for a [[billycan]] or other cooking vessel. This design is scalable, and may be used for anything from tiny [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] stoves to large portable woodstoves. Fuel may be manufactured, e.g., [[Hexamine fuel tablet|hexamine]], or natural, e.g., woody forest debris.\n\n=== Manufactured fuel ===\n\nAmong compact commercial models, the [[Esbit]] [[hexamine stove]] burns small tablets of [[hexamine]] or [[trioxane]] in a folding stand made of aluminium or other base metal, and is a German design that dates from World War II.<ref>G. Rottman & I. Palmer, \"German Field Fortifications 1939-45\", (Osprey Publishing 2004) p. 37</ref> Generally intended for use by a single person, the fumes will tend to taint food if exposed to the burning tablets, and will also leave a messy residue that may be difficult to remove from cookware.<ref>D.

This native fuel typically consists of twigs and small pine cones the user gathers at their campsite and places in the fuel chamber of their stove. This substitution of natural fuel for artificial fuel can amount to a savings of several ounces or pounds of fuel and their containers not carried in a traveler's pack, depending on length of trip. Issues of plumbing connections, fuel toxicity, leakage, spillage, and stove flareup are also nonexistent when using a solid-fuel portable stove. Contribution to climate change and dependence on fossil fuel is also minimized when using a portable stove powered by a local, renewable [[biomass]] resource (however, carbon dioxide is released no matter what source of fuel you use).\n\nWhile simple, solid-fuel stoves have some disadvantages versus their liquid-fueled counterparts. In most cases, the burn rate may be controlled only by varying the amount of fuel placed on the fire, while fluid fuels may be controlled precisely with [[valve]]s. In addition, no solid fuel burns completely. Solid-fuel stoves produce a small amount of ash, and they can coat the bottoms of cooking vessels with tars and [[soot]]. In addition, because some of the [[chemical energy]] of the fuel remains locked up in the smoke and soot, solid fuel releases less heat, gram for gram.\n\nA simple [[hobo stove]] is constructed out of a discarded tin can of any size by removing the top of the can, punching a number of holes near the upper edge, and punching corresponding holes in the opposite base. Wood or other fuel is placed in the can and ignited. A pot (or larger tin can) is placed on the top of the can for cooking. Stoves of similar design can be made out of materials other than cans, such as discarded duct pipe. More complex stoves may use a double-walled design with a chamber for partial [[biomass gasification]] and additional mixing to increase heat output and provide a cleaner, more complete burn.\n\nAnother type of a solid fuel stove which has been becoming more common is what is called the [[rocket stove]]. It is found more commonly in lesser-developed countries where wood fuel sources are more scarce. There are several different designs that are used but smaller ones are portable and are made of steel and other materials with insulation inside a double-walled design with a chamber for partial [[biomass gasification]] and additional mixing of air and wood gas to increase heat output and provide a cleaner, more-complete burn. The advantage of these rocket stoves is their requiring little fuel, such as wood and dry weeds, to cook a meal, and with this less air pollution.\n\nThe single [[AA battery]] operated, fan-driven Sierra \"Zip\" stove burns small twigs, pinecones, bark, or other small flammable items. The fuel is placed into a small chamber and, with the fan turned on, burns at a high heat output of 15,000 [[BTU]]s/hr (4.40&nbsp;kW), about twice that of typical gasoline stoves.<ref>C. Jacobson & L. Levin, \"Basic Illustrated Camping\", (Globe Pequot 2008) p. 33</ref> Because the wood burns quickly in a Zip stove, it needs to be constantly refueled during cooking. However, because of its ability to take advantage of whatever small bits of wood that can be scrounged from the forest floor, the additional weight and bulk of packing additional fuel supplies is avoided. [[Edward B. Garvey|Ed Garvey]], the noted [[Appalachian trail]] benefactor and multiple A.T. [[thru-hiker]], carried a Zip stove with him when he hiked the A.T. at the age of 75.<ref>E.

Keen, ed. \"Surgery, Its Principles and Practice\", p.122 (W.B. Saunders 1921)</ref>\n\nSince the invention of the portable stove in the 19th century, a wide variety of designs and models have seen use in a number of different applications. Portable stoves can be broken down into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and stove design: unpressurized stoves that use solid or liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition; stoves that use a volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner; bottled gas stoves; and gravity-fed \"spirit\" stoves.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early example===\n[[File:Japanese Shichirin HIbachi Conro.JPG|thumb|Various Japanese traditional shichirin]]\nThe [[shichirin]], a lightweight charcoal stove, has been used in [[Japan]] in much the same form since at least the [[Edo period]] (1603-1868).<ref>[http://www.city.onojo.fukuoka.jp/library/kyouiku/rekisi/shuppan/minzoku-14.pdf \u300c\u5927\u91ce\u57ce\u5e02\u6b74\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u5c55\u793a\u5ba4\u89e3\u8aac\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u6c11\u4fd7No.14\u3000\u6c11\u5177\uff11\uff08\u98df\u751f\u6d3b\u306b\u304b\u304b\u308f\u308b\u6c11\u5177\uff09\u300d\u5927\u91ce\u57ce\u5e02\u6559\u80b2\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002131505/http://www.city.onojo.fukuoka.jp/library/kyouiku/rekisi/shuppan/minzoku-14.pdf |date=2011-10-02 }}</ref> Old shichirin are mainly [[ceramic]] and many can be found in old houses.

French-born [[chef]], [[Alexis Soyer]], became ''chef de cuisine'' at the [[Reform Club]] in London from 1837. He instituted many innovations, including cooking with gas, refrigerators cooled by cold water, and ovens with adjustable temperatures. In 1849 Soyer began to market his portable \"magic stove\" which allowed people to cook food wherever they were. The design of Soyer's \"Magic Stove\" was based on the same principle as a [[kerosene lamp]], in which a wick is used to draw fuel from a tank or reservoir to a burner.<ref>A. Soyer, \"The Modern Housewife Or M\u00e9nag\u00e8re: Comprising Nearly One Thousand Recipes for the Economic and Judicious Preparation of Every Meal of the Day, and Those for the Nursery and Sick Room: with Minute Directions for Family Management in All Its Branches\", pp. 451-52 (Simpkin, Marshall & Co. 1851)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Soyer Stove.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Alexis Soyer]]'s \"Magic Stove\", used by British troops during the [[Crimean War]]<ref>{{cite book | title = The Modern Housewife: Or, M\u00e9nag\u00e8re.

Later he was paid his expenses and wages equivalent to those of a Brigadier-General. He designed his own field stove, the Soyer Stove, and trained and installed in every regiment the \"Regimental cook\" so that soldiers would get an adequate meal and not suffer from malnutrition or die of food poisoning. Catering standards within the [[British Army]] would remain inconsistent, however, and there would not be a single [[Army Catering Corps]] until 1945. This is now part of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]], whose catering HQ is called Soyer's House. His stove, or adaptions of it, remained in British military service into the late 20th century.\n\nIn the 1850s, the famous [[Alps|Alpine]] [[mountaineer]] [[Francis Fox Tuckett]] developed an alcohol stove for campers and mountaineers known as the \"Russian furnace.\" It was also known as the \"Rob Roy,\" after [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]], the renowned canoeist who was nicknamed \"Rob Roy.\" MacGregor's 1866 book, \"A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe\" was an international success and described his camping methods.<ref>Invisible on Everest; Innovation and the Gear Makers, p.75</ref> Tuckett's stove and integral cook kit was designed to hang from a cord in the interior of a tent.<ref>Alpine Journal Vo. 2, 1866, page 10</ref>\n\n[[Fridtjof Nansen]] also developed an alcohol stove in the 1880s based on the work of [[Adolphus Greely]]. This improved on early designs and later became the basis for the [[Trangia]] cooker.<ref>Invisible on Everest; Innovation and the Gear Makers, p.33</ref>\n\n[[File:Svea fotogenk\u00f6k.jpg|thumb|left|Early portable kerosene stove]]\n[[Carl Richard Nyberg]] invented the blowtorch in 1882 and began manufacturing Primus stoves a decade later.<ref>Invisible on Everest; Innovation and the Gear Makers, p.35</ref> The first model, called ''Viktoria'', was not very successful, but the later ''Svea'' did better.<ref name=museet>[http://www.museet.se/historik/persona/nyberg/index.htm Sundbybergs Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529202847/http://www.museet.se/historik/persona/nyberg/index.htm |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>  Other sources credit [[Frans W Lindqvist]] for the same thing at the same time.\n\nThe use of single burner alcohol stoves for camping, similar to the contemporary [[Trangia]] brand, was reported as early as 1919.<ref>E. Morris, \"The Rainy Day in Camp\", in Outing Magazine p. 231 (July 1919)</ref> For many years alcohol-based stoves were used on sailboats rather than stoves using kerosene for safety reasons; these have since been largely replaced by stoves using compressed gas (such as [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[butane]] or propane) in disposable or refillable canisters.<ref>J. Smith, \"Kitchen Afloat: Galley Management and Meal Preparation\", pp.47-49 (Sheridan House 2002)</ref> Stoves designed for [[military]] use, such as the [[World War II]]-era [[G.I. Pocket Stove]], were designed to run on [[gasoline]].  So-called \"[[white gas]]\" or [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]] is commonly used as a fuel for camping and backpacking stoves, such as the compact [[Svea 123]]. Newer camping stoves are capable of burning multiple types of fuel, which makes them well suited for international travel where some particular types of fuel may not be readily available.<ref>M. Mouland, \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Camping and Hiking\", p. 324 (Alpha Books 1999)</ref>\n\nThe use of lightweight portable stoves for camping became commonplace in Britain and Europe in the latter half of the 19th Century. The practice gained acceptance later in North America, and coincided with increased awareness of the environmental impact that campers backpackers had on the areas where they travelled.\n\nPrior to their use, the usual practice when backpacking was to build an open fire for cooking from available materials such as fallen branches. The fire scar left on the ground would remain for two or three years before the vegetation recovered. The accumulation of fire scars in heavily travelled areas detracted from the pristine appearance that backpackers expected, leading to more widespread use of portable stoves.\n\n==Uses==\nStoves differ widely in their size and portability. The smallest models are generally termed ''backpacking stoves''. They are designed for use in [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] and [[bicycle touring]], where light weight and small size are paramount considerations. Backpacking stoves consist only of the burner, fuel tank and pot supports. The legs&nbsp;\u2013 if any&nbsp;\u2013 are often collapsible to minimize the space required. The weight may range from about 1 to 2 [[ounce]]s (30 to 60 g) for simple alcohol stoves, {{convert|11|to|14|oz}} for MSR-type stoves (without fuel weight) and canister stoves (with gas cartridge), and up to {{convert|1|lb}} for larger stoves.<ref>C. Fletcher, \"The Complete Walker III: The Joys and Techniques of Hiking and Backpacking\", p. 229 (Knopf 1984)</ref> Single burner alcohol stoves, beverage can stoves, and small liquid fuel and gas canister stoves are well suited for backpacking.\n\n''Camping stoves'' are designed for use by people travelling by [[automobile|car]], [[boat]], [[canoe]], or on [[horseback riding|horseback]]. They are similar in function and ease of use to kitchen stovetops, usually with two burners set into a table-like surface, and often with a folding lid for stowage and wind protection. This increases the weight accordingly.<ref>B. McKeown, \"Start Camping the Easy Way&nbsp;\u2013 By Car\", in Popular Mechanics Magazine, at p. 102 (March 1976)</ref>\n\n== Unpressurized liquid-fuel stoves ==\n[[File:Trangia-Burner-MJC01.jpg|thumb|[[Trangia]] single-burner alcohol stove with cap and lid]]\n[[File:Canstove.jpg|thumb|left|A homemade soda can stove]]\n\n=== Single burner alcohol stoves{{anchor|alcohol stove}} ===\n\nThe simplest type of stove is an unpressurized single burner design, in which the burner contains the [[fuel]] and which once lit burns until it is either extinguished or the fuel is exhausted. There are both liquid- and solid-fuel stoves of this variety. Because they are extremely small and lightweight, this type of stove tends to be favored by [[ultralight backpacking|ultralight backpackers]] as well as those seeking to minimize weight and bulk, particularly for extended backpacking trips. Solid-fuel stoves are also commonly used in emergency kits both because they are compact and the fuel is very stable over time.<ref>J. McCann, \"Build the Perfect Survival Kit: Custom Kits for Adventure, Sport, Travel\", p.54 (Krause Publications 2005)</ref> These simple stoves are also commonly used when serving [[fondue]].\n\nThe [[Trangia]] stove is a popular commercial [[alcohol]] stove, which is available in many different models, from a single bare burner to an integrated expedition cooking system. Some of these come with a sealing cover, allowing the burner to be packed while still containing fuel, although putting the lid on while the stove is hot can damage the O ring seal (hence it may leak in transit). An even simpler system is the [[Sterno]] heater, in which the can that contains a jellied fuel also serves as the burner. Homemade [[beverage can stove]]s (or \"Pepsi/beer/etc. can stoves\") are similar. These are made from discarded aluminium [[beverage can]]s, and come in a wide variety of different designs.\n\n=== Gravity-fed spirit stoves ===\n[[File:Spirit stove on yacht.jpg|thumb|Two-burner spirit stove, with far burner on low heat]]\n\nThe traditional \"spirit stove\" (alcohol or [[methylated spirits]]) consists of a small reservoir or fuel tank raised above and to the side of the burner. The fuel tank supplies the methylated spirits under gravity to the burner, where it is vaporized and burned.\nThe gravity-fed spirit stove is still found in many pleasure boats, although it has largely been replaced by compressed gas stoves.<ref>G. Buehler, \"The Troller Yacht Book\", p. 99 (W. W. Norton & Co. 1999)</ref>\n\nLighting a gravity-fed spirit stove is similar to lighting a traditional Primus stove. Around each burner is a priming pan used to preheat the burner. To light the stove, the burner is first turned on to allow a small amount of fuel to pass through the burner and collect as a liquid in the priming pan. The burner is then turned off, and the fuel ignited to preheat the burner. When the fuel in the pan is almost all gone, the burner is turned on again, and fuel passes into the burner where it is vaporized and passes through the jets.\n\nThese stoves look and even sound a bit like pressurized burner stoves, but the fuel tank is under no pressure. They remain popular for small boats owing to the minimal fire risk they pose in a confined space.\n\n=== Wicking stoves ===\n{{See also|Kerosene lamp|Kerosene heater}}\nWicking stoves are typically fueled by alcohol or kerosene.\n* ORIGO alcohol stove\n*[[Project Gaia#The CleanCook Stove|Project Gaia\u00a7The CleanCook Stove]]\n*Butterfly 16-Wick Kerosene Cook Stove\n\n==== Platinum Catalysis stove ====\n{{See also|Catalytic heater}}\n[[Humphry Davy]] discovered the use of platinum in [[catalysis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bond|first=Alexander Russell|title=Scientific American Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X803AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA251|year=1921|publisher=Scientific American Publishing Company|pages=251\u2013|quote=Producing Heat by Catalysis (Translated for the ''Scientific American Monthly'' from ''La Nature'' (Paris), December 25, 1920. - Flameless Stove Used by the French Army During the War - By R.

Lindqvist's stove was based on the pressurized [[blowtorch]] but fitted with an upturned burner assembly of his own design. Together with partner J.V. Svensson, Lindqvist established the [[Primus AB|Primus]] brand of stove, which quickly developed into a worldwide market leader.\n\nThe kerosene burning [[Primus stove]]s and their imitators were made of brass and were a significant advance over previous designs, which had used a wick to supply liquid fuel to the burner by capillary action. The Primus burner vaporized the fuel in a loop of pipe which rose up from the fuel tank at the stove's base, and which was pre-heated with alcohol (or \"[[methylated spirits]]\") before being combusted in the burner. Initial pressure is provided by a small, hand-operated pump integrated into the stove's fuel tank. The flame on a Primus stove is adjusted by using the pump to increase the pressure in the tank to make the flame larger, or by venting the tank to reduce the pressure and make the flame smaller. Later models used a separate valve to adjust the flame. Primus-style stoves were made in a variety of sizes and styles, and many were designed to be disassembled for storage and transportation in a separate case.<ref>Primus Catalog, p.8 (1903)</ref>\n\n=== Compact camping and hiking stoves ===\n[[File:MSR Patent Model 9-XGK Stove.jpg|thumb|Patent drawing of MSR XGK stove]]\n[[File:PortableGasolineStove PreHeat.jpg|thumb|Pre-heats MSR WhisperliteInternational]]\n\nSmaller, more compact stoves were developed in the early 20th century that used [[petrol]] (gasoline),<ref>Primus Catalog No. 8126, p. 17 (undated; circa 1935)</ref> which at that time was similar to so-called [[white gas]] and did not have the additives and other constituents contained in [[gasoline additive|modern gasoline]]. Similar in design to the kerosene-burning Primus-style stove, the smaller white gas stove was also made of brass with the fuel tank at the base and the burner assembly at the top. Unlike the Primus-style stove, however, priming both pressurizes the tank and pre-heats the burner assembly in this type of stove. Once lit, the heat from the burner maintains the pressure in the tank until the flame is extinguished. The [[Svea 123]], introduced in 1955, is among the most popular of these \"self pressurizing\" stove designs, and is generally considered to be the first compact camping stove. [[Optimus of Sweden]] manufactures a line of similarly designed stoves in which the stove's components are entirely enclosed in a folding metal case, the most popular of which were the Optimus 8R and 111 (still in production as the [http://www.optimus.se/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=34 Optimus Hiker]).  The [[Coleman Company]] developed a small white gas stove with integral fuel tank for the US Army in [[World War II]], the \"[[GI pocket stove]]\".  Coleman still makes similar stoves, such as the 442, 533 and 550B (the latter of which can also run on kerosene).  These stoves have a pump to build up initial pressure in the fuel tank, but are generally self-pressurising when running (occasional re-pumping may be necessary if the stove is run at full output).\n\nIn the early 1970s [[Mountain Safety Research]] (MSR) designed a pressurized burner stove intended to address performance shortcomings of white gas stoves in cold or adverse conditions, in particular for [[mountaineering]] use.<ref>Backpacker Magazine, p. 138 (May 1998)</ref> First introduced in 1973 and designated the Model 9 (and later as the XGK Expedition), the MSR stove had four main parts: a free-standing burner assembly with integrated pot supports; the fuel bottle, which doubles as the stove's fuel tank; a pump that screws into the bottle; and a flexible tube or pipeline connecting the pump/bottle assembly to the burner assembly.<ref>H. Manning, \"Backpacking: One Step At A Time\", p.274 (Vintage Books 1980)</ref> This type of stove design, with the \"outboard\" fuel tank held away from the burner, is primed in the same manner as other white gas stoves; however, because the tank is not self-pressurizing, the tank must periodically be pumped to maintain pressure to the burner. Most commercial liquid fuel camping stoves on the market today are of this design.\n\nPressurized burner stoves are now available that can burn several different fuels or volatile liquids, including alcohol, gasoline or other motor fuels, kerosene, and jet propellant. Little or no modification is needed; due to variability of the volatility of different fuels, the jets of multi-fuel stoves may need to be changed for the different fuels,<ref>K. Berger & R. Hildebrand, \"Advanced Backpacking: A Trailside Guide\", p. 183 (W. W. Norton & Co. 1998)</ref>, and many others.\n\n=== Coiled burner stoves ===\n\nThe \"coiled burner\" stove is a variant on the pressurized burner design, in which the burner assembly consists of a coiled loop with a small hole in the lower part, through which the vaporized fuel exits and combusts. Generally small, lightweight and cheaply made, these were sold under the brand name \"Stesco\", \"Tay-Kit\",<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA107&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Camp Stove Fits Pocket.\"] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 107, right-top page</ref> \"Handy Camper\" and others. A more substantial version of the coiled burner stove is the Swiss made [[Borde stove]].\n\n=== Gas cartridge stoves ===\n[[File:Primus stove.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A gas cartridge camping stove]]\n\nThe design of most portable gas cartridge stoves is similar to that of many pressurized burner stoves, except the fuel tank or [[EN 417|cartridge]] contains a liquefied gas&nbsp;\u2013 typically [[butane]], [[propane]] or a mixture of hydrocarbons&nbsp;\u2013 that is held under pressure. While the gas in the cartridge is in a liquid state when stored under pressure, it vaporizes immediately as it leaves the storage bottle (i.e., without priming), arriving at the burner as a gas. The principal advantage of gas cartridge stoves is convenience: no priming is required, they are generally maintenance-free and capable of immediate high heat output, the flame is easily adjusted and they are generally considered simpler to operate.<ref>Backpacker Magazine, p. 56 (March 1994)</ref> There are two basic designs for most gas cartridge stoves used for camping: the burner assembly is fitted into the top of the gas cartridge, which serves as the stove's base, or the stove is free-standing and the cartridge is separated from the burner and connected by means of a small hose or pipe.<ref>D. Getchell, \"Gas Pains\", in Backpacker Magazine, p. 101 (April 1994)</ref> Single burner propane stoves commonly used in food service have the gas container integrated into the body of the stove. Butane cartridges are almost exclusively manufactured in [[South Korea]] with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas. Butane canisters manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills canisters with domestic butane.<ref>http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Houston-businessman-overcame-hardships-of-Chinese-8313857.php</ref>\n\n[[File:Iwatani Cassette Feu Tatsujin 01.jpg|thumb|Gas cartridge stove]]\n\nGas cartridges for camping stoves tend to be costly and usually are not refillable. Single-use cartridges are considered objectionable by some on environmental grounds. They perform poorly in cold weather.<ref>C. Townsend, \"The Advanced Backpacker: A Handbook of Year-Round, Long-Distance Hiking\", p. 164 (McGraw-Hill 2000)</ref> Until the approval of [[EN 417|EN 417-specification Lindal valve cartridges]] of 1992 there was little compatibility between different makers and systems, and cartridges for older cartridge stoves were often unobtainable. Outside of camping, single-burner stoves using cans of compressed butane gas are used for catering and other food service applications.<ref>J. Weinberg, \"The Everything Guide to Starting and Running a Catering Business: Insider's Advice on Turning Your Talent Into a Career\", p. 144 (Everything Books 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Coleman stove.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Coleman white gas camp stove]]\n\nRefillable gas bottles are heavier, and tend to be used on larger stoves intended for car camping, expedition base camps, and residential use (as for [[barbecue]]s).\n\n=== Multiple burner stoves ===\n\nStoves with two or more burners that may be operated together or separately are common for use in base camp, car camping and other situations involving cooking for larger groups. The folding \"suitcase\" style by [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] is the best known of this design, and is intended to be used on a flat, stable surface such as a tabletop. This type of stove may have a separate fuel tank for each burner, or more commonly a single tank shared by both burners. Multiple burner stoves generally use compressed gas, alcohol or [[Naphtha]] (also known as [[White gas]] or [[Coleman fuel]]).<ref>M. Rutter, \"Camping Made Easy\", pp. 61-62 (Globe Pequot 2001)</ref>\n\n== Solid-fuel stoves ==\n[[File:Pocket-size collapsible cooker.jpg|thumb|Esbit stove with box of fuel tablets]]\n\nA solid-fuel stove may consist of no more than a metal base plate and container to hold the fuel, a set of legs to keep this assembly out of contact with the ground, and some supports for a [[billycan]] or other cooking vessel. This design is scalable, and may be used for anything from tiny [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] stoves to large portable woodstoves. Fuel may be manufactured, e.g., [[Hexamine fuel tablet|hexamine]], or natural, e.g., woody forest debris.\n\n=== Manufactured fuel ===\n\nAmong compact commercial models, the [[Esbit]] [[hexamine stove]] burns small tablets of [[hexamine]] or [[trioxane]] in a folding stand made of aluminium or other base metal, and is a German design that dates from World War II.<ref>G. Rottman & I. Palmer, \"German Field Fortifications 1939-45\", (Osprey Publishing 2004) p. 37</ref> Generally intended for use by a single person, the fumes will tend to taint food if exposed to the burning tablets, and will also leave a messy residue that may be difficult to remove from cookware.<ref>D. Ladigin & M. Clelland, \"Lighten Up!: A Complete Handbook for Light and Ultralight Backpacking\", pp. 61-62 (Globe Pequot 2005)</ref>\n\n[[File:Grover Rocket Stove.JPG|thumb|A rocket stove]]\n\nOutside of America, [[metaldehyde]] is used as a solid fuel in small portable stoves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/haloxyfop-methylparathion/metaldehyde-ext.html|title=Metaldehyde|publisher= Cornell University|access-date = 13 July 2016|date= September 1993}}</ref> It is a lightweight fuel with little smell that burns leaving no residue. It is however toxic to animals including humans if ingested<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227882976_Part_1_Treatment_of_Snail_Bait_Toxicity_in_Dogs_Literature_Review|title= Treatment of Snail Bait Toxicity in Dogs - Literature Review|access-date=13 July 2016|publisher= researchgate.net|date = 1991}}</ref> and metaldehyde fuel tablets need to be handled with care to avoid inadvertent ingestion.\n\n=== Natural fuel, forest wood debris ===\n\nStoves that use natural solid fuel, e.g., wood and other forest debris, have an obvious advantage: the user need not carry any stove fuel on his or her back. This native fuel typically consists of twigs and small pine cones the user gathers at their campsite and places in the fuel chamber of their stove. This substitution of natural fuel for artificial fuel can amount to a savings of several ounces or pounds of fuel and their containers not carried in a traveler's pack, depending on length of trip. Issues of plumbing connections, fuel toxicity, leakage, spillage, and stove flareup are also nonexistent when using a solid-fuel portable stove. Contribution to climate change and dependence on fossil fuel is also minimized when using a portable stove powered by a local, renewable [[biomass]] resource (however, carbon dioxide is released no matter what source of fuel you use).\n\nWhile simple, solid-fuel stoves have some disadvantages versus their liquid-fueled counterparts. In most cases, the burn rate may be controlled only by varying the amount of fuel placed on the fire, while fluid fuels may be controlled precisely with [[valve]]s. In addition, no solid fuel burns completely. Solid-fuel stoves produce a small amount of ash, and they can coat the bottoms of cooking vessels with tars and [[soot]]. In addition, because some of the [[chemical energy]] of the fuel remains locked up in the smoke and soot, solid fuel releases less heat, gram for gram.\n\nA simple [[hobo stove]] is constructed out of a discarded tin can of any size by removing the top of the can, punching a number of holes near the upper edge, and punching corresponding holes in the opposite base. Wood or other fuel is placed in the can and ignited. A pot (or larger tin can) is placed on the top of the can for cooking. Stoves of similar design can be made out of materials other than cans, such as discarded duct pipe. More complex stoves may use a double-walled design with a chamber for partial [[biomass gasification]] and additional mixing to increase heat output and provide a cleaner, more complete burn.\n\nAnother type of a solid fuel stove which has been becoming more common is what is called the [[rocket stove]]. It is found more commonly in lesser-developed countries where wood fuel sources are more scarce. There are several different designs that are used but smaller ones are portable and are made of steel and other materials with insulation inside a double-walled design with a chamber for partial [[biomass gasification]] and additional mixing of air and wood gas to increase heat output and provide a cleaner, more-complete burn. The advantage of these rocket stoves is their requiring little fuel, such as wood and dry weeds, to cook a meal, and with this less air pollution.\n\nThe single [[AA battery]] operated, fan-driven Sierra \"Zip\" stove burns small twigs, pinecones, bark, or other small flammable items. The fuel is placed into a small chamber and, with the fan turned on, burns at a high heat output of 15,000 [[BTU]]s/hr (4.40&nbsp;kW), about twice that of typical gasoline stoves.<ref>C. Jacobson & L. Levin, \"Basic Illustrated Camping\", (Globe Pequot 2008) p. 33</ref> Because the wood burns quickly in a Zip stove, it needs to be constantly refueled during cooking. However, because of its ability to take advantage of whatever small bits of wood that can be scrounged from the forest floor, the additional weight and bulk of packing additional fuel supplies is avoided. [[Edward B. Garvey|Ed Garvey]], the noted [[Appalachian trail]] benefactor and multiple A.T. [[thru-hiker]], carried a Zip stove with him when he hiked the A.T. at the age of 75.<ref>E.

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953.

After returning to [[California Institute of Technology]] for a short while, Shockley moved to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]], in 1956, and founded [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]]. Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.  Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire.\"\n\nAccording to Arbuckle (p.&nbsp;380\u2013381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E. Allen and C. Burnham led the way to \"build a line from San Francisco to Marysville via San Jose, Stockton, and Sacramento\".  Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, \"\u2026San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.  The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24.\"\n\nThe Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology.

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs.

Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of [[venture capital]] on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3&nbsp;billion [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.<ref name=\"WRichardScott\" />\n\nIn 1971 [[Don Hoefler]] traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]]'s eight co-founders.<ref name=DH-71 /><ref name=\"NetValley\">[http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the \"Golden\" Startups of Silicon Valley] by Gregory Gromov</ref> The key investors in [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] were from the same group, directly leading to ''[[Tech Crunch]]'' 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 Trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.<ref name=Morris-2014>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/ |title=The First Trillion-Dollar Startup | work=[[Tech Crunch]] |first=Rhett |last=Morris |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref>\n{{Wide image|Silicon Vally Venture Capital investment.png|800px|align-cap=center|Silicon Valley [[venture capital]] investment, 2002-2017.|100%|center}}\n\n===Law firms===\nPrior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced [[patent attorney]]s whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property.  During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley.

Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.\n\nUsing money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].\n\nWhile Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.<ref>[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com</ref> Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over [[Stanford University]]'s [[Ethernet]] [[campus network]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John K. |last = Waters |date= 2002 |title= John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility  |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=  9780471273554| page = 28}}</ref>\n\n===Internet age===\n{{main|Internet}}\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.<ref name=N1995>{{cite book|author1=W.
