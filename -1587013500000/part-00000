The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. [[Academic]] definitions of the term ''genre ''itself vary. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', [[Douglass M. Green]] distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period.

Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511| title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2| doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\".<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\">Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\".

Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. \"Musique Savante (Serious Music)\". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\">Arnold, Denis: \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37\u201367, here 41\u201342.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz].

Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\n\n<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\"/></blockquote>\n\nPopular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|'' Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\n\nThe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics.

The [[genealogy of musical genres]] expresses, often in the form of a written chart, how new genres have developed under the influence of older ones.

He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317, are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Form in Tonal Music|last=Green|first=Douglass M.|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc|isbn=978-0-03-020286-5|page=1}}</ref> Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\"<ref name=Pete>{{cite book|title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music|last=van der Merwe|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|year=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-316121-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3}}</ref> Others, such as Allan F.

Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511| title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2| doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\".<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\">Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\".

Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. \"Musique Savante (Serious Music)\". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\">Arnold, Denis: \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37\u201367, here 41\u201342.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz].

Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\n\n<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\"/></blockquote>\n\nPopular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|'' Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\n\nThe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics.

Rooted in [[1960s]] [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of [[mainstream]] 1970s [[rock]]. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, [[anti-establishment]] lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through [[independent record label]]s.\n\nThe term \"punk rock\" was first used by American [[Music criticism|rock critics]] in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors. When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976, acts such as [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in London; and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in Brisbane formed its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].\n\nIn 1977, the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading worldwide, especially in England. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the [[mainstream]]. In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]]), and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Crass]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued other musical directions, giving rise to spinoffs such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]]. By the 1990s, punk re-emerged into the mainstream with the success of punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See also|Punk subculture|List of punk artists and styles}}\n<!-- not combined because a different direction for the reader --><!-- note deorphaning -->\n\n===Philosophy===\nThe first wave of punk rock was \"aggressively modern\" and differed from what came before.<ref name=\"RMB\">Robb (2006), p. xi.</ref> According to [[Ramones]] drummer [[Tommy Ramone]], \"In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting.

[[UK pub rock]] from 1972-1975 contributed to the emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play.<ref name=\"Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18\">Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''. PM Press, 2015. p. 18</ref> Pub rock also introduced the idea of [[independent record label]]s, such as [[Stiff Records]], which put out basic, low-cost records.<ref name=\"Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18\"/> Pub rock bands organized their own small venue tours and put out small pressings of their records. In the early days of punk rock, this DIY ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands.<ref>Rodel (2004), p. 237; Bennett (2001), pp. 49\u201350.</ref> Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was \"rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music\".<ref name=\"MM\"/> In December 1976, the English [[fanzine]] ''Sideburns'' published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned \"This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band\".<ref>Savage (1992), pp. 280\u2013281, including reproduction of the original image. Several sources incorrectly ascribe the illustration to the leading fanzine of the London punk scene, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'' (e.g., Wells [2004], p. 5; Sabin [1999], p. 111). Robb (2006) ascribes it to [[the Stranglers]]' in-house fanzine, ''Strangled'' (p. 311). In fact, ''Strangled'', which only began appearing in 1977, evolved out of ''Sideburns'' (see, e.g., {{cite web|url=http://www.xulucomics.com/strangled.html|title=''Strangled'' |publisher=Xulu Brand Comics|accessdate=2009-03-19}})</ref>\n\nBritish punk rejected contemporary mainstream rock, the broader culture it represented, and their music predecessors: \"No [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]] or [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1977\", declared [[the Clash]] song \"1977\".<ref>Harris (2004), p. 202.</ref> 1976, when the punk revolution began in Britain, became a musical and a cultural \"Year Zero\".<ref name=\"Reynolds p4\">Reynolds (2005), p. 4.</ref> As nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude summed up by the [[Sex Pistols]] slogan \"No Future\";<ref name=\"RMB\"/> in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, \"punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England.\"<ref>Jeffries, Stuart. \"A Right Royal Knees-Up\".

Bassists often use a [[Plectrum|pick]] due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes [[fingerpicking]] impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up.

Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in \"Love Comes in Spurts\", written by [[Richard Hell]] and recorded by him with the Voidoids. [[Anomie]], variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's \"[[Blank Generation (song)|Blank Generation]]\" and the bluntness of the Ramones' \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by [[V. Vale]], founder of San Francisco fanzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'': \"Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way\".<ref>Savage (1991), p. 440.

A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as \"Hollywood punks\" and \"beach punks\", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].<ref>Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217\u201332; Stark (2006), \"Dissolution\" (pp. 91\u201393); see also, [http://flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html \"Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!\"] (Flipsidezine.com article archive).</ref>\n\nAs hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up.<ref>Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274\u201379.</ref> Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between \"classic\" punk, [[post-punk]], and hardcore, San Francisco's [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.<ref>See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208\u201311.</ref> They became \"the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years\".<ref>Dougan, John.

Meanwhile, the [[Oi!]] and [[anarcho-punk]] movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, \"The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&nbsp;...

Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as [[the Queers]] and [[Screeching Weasel]], began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]], who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as [[the Vandals]] and [[Guttermouth]] developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like [[Dillinger Four]] who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as [[Blink-182]] is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"<ref>Di Bella, Christine.

Rooted in 1960s [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, [[anti-establishment]] lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through [[independent record label]]s.\n\nThe term \"punk rock\" was first used by American [[Music criticism|rock critics]] in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors. When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976, acts such as [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in London; and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in Brisbane formed its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].\n\nIn 1977, the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading worldwide, especially in England. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the [[mainstream]]. In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]]), and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Crass]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued other musical directions, giving rise to spinoffs such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]]. By the 1990s, punk re-emerged into the mainstream with the success of punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See also|Punk subculture|List of punk artists and styles}}\n<!-- not combined because a different direction for the reader --><!-- note deorphaning -->\n\n===Philosophy===\nThe first wave of punk rock was \"aggressively modern\" and differed from what came before.<ref name=\"RMB\">Robb (2006), p. xi.</ref> According to [[Ramones]] drummer [[Tommy Ramone]], \"In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting.

[[Anomie]], variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's \"[[Blank Generation (song)|Blank Generation]]\" and the bluntness of the Ramones' \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by [[V. Vale]], founder of San Francisco fanzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'': \"Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way\".<ref>Savage (1991), p. 440.

A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as \"Hollywood punks\" and \"beach punks\", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].<ref>Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217\u201332; Stark (2006), \"Dissolution\" (pp. 91\u201393); see also, [http://flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html \"Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!\"] (Flipsidezine.com article archive).</ref>\n\nAs hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up.<ref>Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274\u201379.</ref> Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between \"classic\" punk, [[post-punk]], and hardcore, San Francisco's [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.<ref>See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208\u201311.</ref> They became \"the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years\".<ref>Dougan, John.

Meanwhile, the [[Oi!]] and [[anarcho-punk]] movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, \"The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&nbsp;...

Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as [[the Queers]] and [[Screeching Weasel]], began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]], who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as [[the Vandals]] and [[Guttermouth]] developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like [[Dillinger Four]] who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as [[Blink-182]] is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"<ref>Di Bella, Christine.

By the 1990s, punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as \"rebels\". Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile, the [[Subaru Impreza]], claimed that the car was \"like punk rock\".<ref>Klein (2000), p. 300.</ref>\n\nIn 1993, California's [[Green Day]] and [[Bad Religion]] were both signed to major labels.

Among the many individuals and organizations that operate in the industry are: the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s who create new songs and musical pieces; the [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[conducting|conductors]] and [[bandleader]]s who perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell [[sound recording|recorded music]] and/or [[sheet music]] (e.g., [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]], [[Record producer|music producers]], [[recording studios]], [[Audio engineering|engineers]], [[record label]]s, retail and [[online music store]]s, [[performance rights organization]]s); and those that help organize and present [[live music]] performances ([[sound engineer]]s, [[talent agent|booking agents]], [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]], [[music venue]]s, [[road crew]]).\n\nThe industry also includes a range of professionals who assist singers and musicians with their music careers ([[talent manager]]s, [[artists and repertoire]] managers, [[business manager]]s, [[entertainment law]]yers); those who broadcast audio or video music content ([[satellite radio|satellite]], [[internet radio|Internet radio stations]], [[radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] and [[television broadcasting|TV stations]]); [[music journalist]]s and [[music critic]]s; [[DJ]]s; [[music education|music educators and teachers]]; [[musical instrument]] manufacturers; as well as many others. In addition to the businesses and artists who work in the music industry to make a profit or income, there is a range of organizations that also play an important role in the music industry, including musician's unions (e.g., [[American Federation of Musicians]]), not-for-profit performance-rights organizations (e.g., [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]) and other associations (e.g., [[International Alliance for Women in Music]], a non-profit organization that advocates for [[Women in music|women composers and musicians]]).\n\nThe modern Western music industry emerged between the 1930s and 1950s, when [[Gramophone record|records]] replaced [[sheet music]] as the most important product in the music business. In the commercial world, \"the recording industry\"\u2014a reference to [[sound recording|recording performances of songs and pieces]] and selling the recordings\u2013began to be used as a loose synonym for \"the music industry\". In the 2000s, a majority of the music market is controlled by three major corporate labels: the French-owned [[Universal Music Group]], the Japanese-owned [[Sony Music Entertainment]],<ref name=\"sonybmg\">Sony Corporation announced October 1, 2008 that it had completed the acquisition of Bertelsmann's 50% stake in Sony BMG, which was originally announced on August 5, 2008.

Pictured is the hand-written music manuscript for a French [[Ars subtilior]] chanson (song) from the late 1300s about love, entitled ''Belle, bonne, sage'', by Baude Cordier. The [[music notation]] is unusual in that it is written in a heart shape, with red notes indicating rhythmic [[#Notational characteristics|alterations]].]]\nMusic publishing using machine-printed [[sheet music]] developed during the [[Renaissance music]] era in the mid-15th century. The development of music publication followed the evolution of [[printing]] technologies that were first developed for printing regular [[book]]s. After the mid-15th century,  mechanical techniques for printing sheet music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg Bible]] was printed. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. To copy music notation by hand was a very costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular (non-religious) music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy aristocrats. Examples include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] of Italian [[Trecento]] music and the [[Chantilly Codex]] of French [[Ars subtilior]] music.\n\nThe use of printing enabled sheet music to reproduced much more quickly and at a much lower cost than hand-copying music notation. This helped musical styles to spread to other cities and countries more quickly, and it also enabled music to be spread to more distant areas. Prior to the invention of music printing, a composer's music might only be known in the city she lived in and its surrounding towns, because only wealthy aristocrats would be able to afford to have hand copies made of her music. With music printing, though, a composer's music could be printed and sold at a relatively low cost to purchasers from a wide geographic area. As sheet music of major composer's pieces and songs began to be printed and distributed in a wider area, this enabled composers and listeners to hear new styles and forms of music. A German composer could buy songs written by an Italian or English composer, and an Italian composer could buy pieces written by Dutch composers and learn how they wrote music. This led to more blending of musical styles from different countries and regions.\n\nThe pioneer of modern music printing was [[Ottaviano Petrucci]]  (born in Fossombrone in 1466 \u2013 died in 1539 in Venice ), a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. [[Venice]] was one of the major business and music centers during this period. His ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', a collection of chansons printed in 1501, is commonly misidentified as the first book of sheet music printed from movable type. Actually that distinction belongs to the Roman printer Ulrich Han's ''Missale Romanum'' of 1476. Nevertheless, Petrucci's later work was extraordinary for the complexity of his white mensural notation and the smallness of his font. He printed the first book of [[polyphony]] (music with two or more independent melodic lines) using movable type. He also published numerous works by the most highly regarded composers of the Renaissance, including [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Antoine Brumel]]. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the [[Renaissance music]] era. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean and readable results, although it was time-consuming and expensive.\n\nUntil the 18th century, the processes of formal composition and of the printing of music took place for the most part with the support of [[patronage]] from [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] and [[Religion|churches]]. In the mid-to-late 18th century, performers and composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] began to seek more commercial opportunities to market their music and performances to the general public. After Mozart's death, his wife ([[Constanze Weber]]) continued the process of commercialization of his music through an unprecedented series of memorial concerts, selling his manuscripts, and collaborating with her second husband, [[Georg Nissen]], on a biography of Mozart.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glover |first=Jane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/02/classicalmusicandopera |title=Dear Constanze &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.png|thumb|right|200px|An example of mechanically printed sheet music.]]\n\nIn the 19th century, [[sheet music|sheet-music]] publishers dominated the music industry. Prior to the invention of [[sound recording]] technologies, the main way for music lovers to hear new symphonies and [[opera]] arias (songs) was to buy the sheet music (often arranged for piano or for a small chamber music group) and perform the music in a living room, using friends who were amateur musicians and singers. In the United States, the music industry arose in tandem with the rise of \"[[black face]]\" [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a [[black people|black person]]. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of negative [[racial stereotype]]s of African-American people.<ref>For the \"darky\"/\"coon\" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E.

Ronald Green (2000), ''Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux'', Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, {{ISBN|0-253-33753-4}}; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific \"coon\" archetype.</ref>\n\nIn the late part of the century the group of music publishers and songwriters which dominated [[popular music]] in the United States became known as [[Tin Pan Alley]]. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], and a plaque (see [[#plaque|below]]) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it. The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of [[Manhattan]]. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear-cut. Some date it to the start of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s when the [[phonograph]] and radio supplanted [[sheet music]] as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of [[rock & roll]].\n\n===Advent of recorded music and radio broadcasting===\n[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief on a cylinder phonograph in 1916.]]\n[[File:Donald Manson working as an employee of the Marconi Company.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A radio broadcasting system from 1906.]]\nAt the dawn of the early 20th century, the development of [[sound recording]] began to function as a [[disruptive technology]] to the commercial interests which published sheet music. During the sheet music era, if a regular person wanted to hear popular new songs, he or she would buy the sheet music and play it at home on a piano, or learn the song at home while playing the [[accompaniment]] part on piano or guitar. Commercially released [[phonograph]] records of musical performances, which became available starting in the late 1880s, and later the onset of widespread [[radio broadcasting]], starting in the 1920s, forever changed the way music was heard and listened to. Opera houses, concert halls, and clubs continued to produce music and musicians and singers continued to perform live, but the power of radio allowed bands, ensembles and singers who had previously performed only in one region to become popular on a nationwide and sometimes even a worldwide scale. Moreover, whereas attendance at the top symphony and opera concerts was formerly restricted to high-income people in a pre-radio world, with [[broadcast radio]], a much larger wider range of people, including lower and middle-income people could hear the best [[orchestra]]s, [[big band]]s, popular singers and opera shows.\n\nThe \"record industry\" eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force. A multitude of record labels came and went. Some noteworthy labels of the earlier decades include the [[Columbia Records]], Crystalate, [[Decca Records]], Edison Bell, [[The Gramophone Company]], Invicta, Kalliope, [[Path\u00e9]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/vintage78rpm/great78/Early_Record_Labels.htm |title=Early Record Label History |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> Many record companies died out as quickly as they had formed, and by the end of the 1980s, the \"Big six\" \u2014 [[EMI]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[PolyGram]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and [[MCA Records|MCA]] \u2014 dominated the industry. [[Sony]] bought [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] in 1987 and changed its name to Sony Music in 1991. In mid-1998, [[PolyGram|PolyGram Music Group]] merged with MCA Music Entertainment creating what we now know as [[Universal Music Group]]. Since then, Sony and BMG merged in 2004,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3908405.stm \"Sony and BMG merger backed by EU\"], BBC News, July 19, 2004</ref> and Universal took over the majority of EMI's recorded music interests in 2012.<ref>Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/21/universal-emi-takeover-approved \"Universal's \u00a31.2bn EMI takeover approved \u2013 with conditions\"], ''The Guardian'' (London),</ref> [[EMI Music Publishing]], also once part of the now defunct British conglomerate, is now co-owned by Sony as a subsidiary of [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emi-music-publishing-sold-sony-atv-estate-michael-jackson-343848 \"Sold!

Forming an [[independent record label]], or \"indie\" label, or signing to such a label continues to be a popular choice for up-and-coming musicians, especially in genres like [[hardcore punk]] and [[extreme metal]], despite the fact that indies cannot offer the same financial backing of major labels. Some bands prefer to sign with an indie label, because these labels typically give performers more artistic freedom.\n\n===Rise of digital and online distribution===\n{{Main|2000s in the music industry|2010s in the music industry}}\n{{ external media\n| topic = [[RIAA]] U.S. Recorded Music Sales Charts (Interactive); Revenue and Volumes by Format.

With streaming services, the user pays a subscription to a company for the right to listen to songs and other media from a library. Whereas with legal digital download services, the purchaser owns a digital copy of the song (which they can keep on their computer or on a digital media player), with streaming services, the user never downloads the song file or owns the song file. The subscriber can only listen to the song for as long as they continue to pay the streaming subscription. Once the user stops paying the subscription, they cannot listen to audio from the company's repositories anymore. Streaming services began to have a serious impact on the industry in 2014.<!-- WILL ADD MORE SHORTLY WHEN I GET SOME REFERENCES -->\n\n[[Spotify]], together with the [[music streaming|music-streaming]] industry in general, faces some criticism from artists claiming they are not being fairly compensated for their work as downloaded-music sales decline and music-streaming increases.

It has undergone dramatic changes in the first decades of the 21st century. However, the majority of the participants in the music industry still fulfill their traditional roles, which are described below.<ref>All of the information in this section can be found in:* {{Krasilovsky et al 2007}}</ref> There are three types of [[property]] that are created and sold by the recording industry: [[musical composition|compositions]] (songs, pieces, lyrics), [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] (audio and video) and media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]] or [[MP3]]s, and [[DVD]]s). There may be many recordings of a single composition and a single recording will typically be distributed via many media. For example, the song \"[[My Way]]\" is owned by its composers, [[Paul Anka]] and [[Claude Fran\u00e7ois]], [[Frank Sinatra]]'s recording of \"My Way\" is owned by [[Capitol Records]], [[Sid Vicious]]'s recording of \"My Way\" is owned by [[Virgin Records]], and the millions of CDs and vinyl records that can play these recordings are owned by millions of individual consumers.\n\n===Compositions===\n\n[[Song]]s, instrumental pieces and other musical compositions are created by [[songwriter]]s or [[composer]]s and are originally owned by the composer, although they may be sold or the rights may be otherwise assigned. For example, in the case of [[work for hire]], the composition is owned immediately by another party. Traditionally, the copyright owner [[licensed|licenses]] or \"assigns\" some of their rights to [[publishing companies]], by means of a [[publishing contract]]. The publishing company (or a collection society operating on behalf of many such publishers, songwriters and composers) collects fees (known as \"[[Music royalties|publishing royalties]]\") when the composition is used. A portion of the royalties are paid by the publishing company to the copyright owner, depending on the terms of the contract. [[Sheet music]] provides an income stream that is paid exclusively to the composers and their publishing company. Typically (although not universally), the publishing company will provide the owner with an [[advance payment|advance]] against future earnings when the publishing contract is signed. A publishing company will also promote the compositions, such as by acquiring song \"placements\" on [[television]] or in [[film]]s.\n\n===Recordings===\n[[File:Sound Gobo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A musician in a recording studio.]]\nRecordings are created by [[recording artist]]s, which includes [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s (including [[session musician]]s) and [[musical ensemble]]s (e.g., [[backing band]]s, [[rhythm section]]s, [[orchestra]]s, etc.) usually with the assistance and guidance from [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s. They were traditionally made in [[recording studio]]s (which are rented for a daily or hourly rate) in a [[recording session]]. In the 21st century, advances in digital recording technology have allowed many producers and artists to create \"[[home studio]]s\" using high-end computers and digital recording programs like [[Pro Tools]], bypassing the traditional role of the commercial recording studio. The [[record producer]] oversees all aspects of the recording, making many of the logistic, financial and artistic decisions in cooperation with the artists. The record producer has a range of different responsibilities including choosing material and/or working with the composers, hiring session musicians, helping to [[musical arrangement|arrange]] the songs, overseeing the musician performances, and directing the audio engineer during recording and mixing to get the best sound. [[Audio engineer]]s (including [[recording engineer|recording]], [[mixing engineer|mixing]] and [[mastering engineer]]s) are responsible for ensuring good audio quality during the recording. They select and set up microphones and use [[effects unit]]s and [[mixing console]]s to adjust the sound and level of the music.  A recording session may also require the services of an [[arranger]], [[orchestrator]], [[studio musician]]s, [[session musician]]s, [[vocal coach]]es, or even a discreetly-hired [[ghostwriter|ghostwriter to help with the lyrics or songwriting]].\n[[File:Ben Feggans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A studio engineer working with an [[audio mixer]] in a recording studio.]]\n\nRecordings are (traditionally) owned by [[record companies]]. Some artists own their own record companies (e.g., [[Ani DiFranco]]). A [[recording contract]] specifies the business relationship between a recording artist and the record company. In a traditional contract, the company provides an advance to the artist who agrees to record music that will be owned by the company. The [[A&R]] department of a record company is responsible for finding new talent and overseeing the recording process. The company pays for the recording costs and the cost of [[radio promotion|promoting]] and [[marketing]] the record. For physical media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]]), the company also pays to [[manufacture]] and [[distribution (business)|distribute]] the physical recordings. Smaller record companies (known as \"[[independent record label|indies]]\") will form business relationships with other companies to handle many of these tasks. The record company pays the recording artist a portion of the income from the sale of the recordings, also known as a \"royalty\", but this is distinct from the publishing royalties described above. This portion is similar to a percentage, but may be limited or expanded by a number of factors (such as free goods, recoupable expenses, bonuses, etc.) that are specified by the record contract. [[Session musician]]s and [[orchestra]] members (as well as a few recording artists in special markets) are under contract to provide [[work for hire]]; they are typically only paid one-time fees or regular wages for their services, rather than ongoing royalties.\n\n===Media===\n\nPhysical media (such as CDs or vinyl records) are sold by music [[retail]]ers and are owned by the consumers after they buy them. Buyers do not typically have the right to make digital copies from CDs or other media they buy, or rent or lease the CDs, because they do not own the recording on the CD, they only own the individual physical CD. A music distributor delivers crates of the packaged physical media from the manufacturer to the retailer and maintains commercial relationships with retailers and record companies. The music retailer pays the distributor, who in turn pays the [[record company]] for the recordings. The record company pays [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] to the publisher and composer via a collection society. The record company then pays royalties, if contractually obligated, to the recording artist. In the case of digital downloads or online [[streaming media|streaming]] of music, there is no physical media other than the consumer's computer memory on his or her portable media player or laptop. For this reason, artists such as Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Kings of Leon, and others have called for legal changes that would deny social media the right to stream their music without paying them royalties.<ref name=\"Knopper2009\" /> In the digital and online music market of the 2000s, the distributor becomes optional. Large online shops may pay the labels directly, but digital distributors do exist to provide distribution services for vendors large and small. When purchasing digital downloads or listening to music streaming, the consumer may be required to agree to record company and vendor licensing terms beyond those which are inherent in [[copyright]]; for example, some services may allow consumers to freely share the recording, but others may restrict the user to storing the music on a specific number of hard drives or devices.\n\n===Broadcast, soundtrack and streaming===\n\nWhen a recording is broadcast (either on radio or by a [[background music]] service such as [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]), [[performance rights organisation]]s (such as the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in the US, SOCAN in Canada, or [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]] in the UK), collect a third type of royalty known as a performance royalty, which is paid to songwriters, composers and recording artists. This royalty is typically much smaller than publishing or [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]]. Within the past decade, more than \"15 to 30 percent\" of tracks on streaming services are unidentified with a specific artist. Jeff Price says \"Audiam, an online music streaming service, has made over several hundred thousand dollars in the past year from collecting royalties from online streaming.<ref name=\"billboard.com\" /> According to Ken Levitan, manager from Kings of Leon, Cheap Trick and others, \"Youtube has become radio for kids\". Because of the overuse of YouTube and offline streaming, album sales have fallen by 60 percent in the past few years.<ref name=\"Knopper2009\" /> When recordings are used in [[television]] and [[film]], the composer and their publishing company are typically paid through a [[synchronization rights|synchronization license]]. In the 2000s, online subscription services (such as [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]) also provide an income stream directly to record companies, and through them, to artists, contracts permitting.\n\n===Live music===\n\n[[File:Pro2Type - CSD Stra\u00dfenfest K\u00f6ln 2013-1759.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A live musical performance at [[Cologne Pride]], 2013.]]\nA [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] brings together a performing artist and a [[Music venue|venue]] owner and arranges contracts. A [[booking agency]] represents the artist to promoters, makes deals and books performances. Consumers usually buy tickets either from the venue or from a ticket distribution service such as [[Ticketmaster]]. In the US, [[Live Nation]] is the dominant company in all of these roles: they own most of the large venues in the US, they are the largest promoter, and they own [[Ticketmaster]]. Choices about where and when to tour are decided by the [[artist manager|artist's management]] and the artist, sometimes in consultation with the [[record company]]. Record companies may finance a tour in the hopes that it will help promote the sale of recordings. However, in the 21st century, it has become more common to release recordings to promote ticket sales for live shows, rather than book tours to promote the sales of recordings.\n\nMajor, successful artists will usually employ a [[road crew]]: a semi-permanent touring organization that travels with the artist during concert series. The road crew is headed by a [[tour manager]]. Crew members provides [[stage lighting]], [[Audio engineering|live sound reinforcement]], [[guitar technician|musical instrument tuning and maintenance]], [[bodyguard]] for the artist and transportation of the equipment and music ensemble members. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager, hairdressers, makeup artists and [[catering]] staff. Local crews are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage. On a small tour with less financial backing, all of these jobs may be handled by just a few roadies or by the musicians themselves. Bands signed with small \"indie\" labels and bands in genres such as [[hardcore punk]] are more likely to do tours without a road crew, or with minimal support.\n\n===Artist management, representation and staff===\n\nArtists such as singers and musicians may hire a number of people from other fields to assist them with their career. The [[artist manager]] oversees all aspects of an artist's career in exchange for a percentage of the artist's income. An [[entertainment law]]yer assists them with the details of their contracts with record companies and other deals. A [[business manager]] handles financial transactions, taxes and bookkeeping. Unions, such as [[AFTRA]] and the [[American Federation of Musicians]] in the U.S. provide [[health insurance]] and instrument insurance for musicians. A successful artist functions in the market as a [[brand]] and, as such, they may derive income from many other streams, such as [[merchandise]], personal endorsements, appearances (without performing) at events or Internet-based services.<ref>http://info.dcc-studios.com/blog/why-branding-is-important-for-djs-and-producers/</ref> These are typically overseen by the artist's [[artist manager|manager]] and take the form of relationships between the artist and companies that specialize in these products. Singers may also hire a [[vocal coach]], [[Dance teacher|dance instructor]], [[Drama teacher|acting coach]], [[personal trainer]] or [[life coach]] to help them.\n\n===Emerging business models===\n\nIn the 2000s, traditional lines that once divided singers, instrumentalists, publishers, record companies, distributors, retail and consumer electronics have become blurred or erased. Artists may record in a [[home studio]] using a high-end [[laptop]] and a digital recording program such as [[Pro Tools]] or use [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for an expensive studio recording session without involving a record company. Artists may choose to exclusively promote and market themselves using only free online video sharing services such as [[YouTube]] or using [[social media]] websites, bypassing traditional promotion and marketing by a record company. In the 2000s, [[consumer electronics]] and [[computer]] companies such as [[Apple Computer]] have become [[Online music store|digital music retailers]]. New digital music distribution technologies and the trends towards using [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of older songs in new songs or blending different songs to create [[mashup (music)|\"mashup\"]] recordings have also forced both governments and the music industry to re-examine the definitions of [[intellectual property]] and the rights of all the parties involved. Also compounding the issue of defining copyright boundaries is the fact that the definition of \"royalty\" and \"copyright\" varies from country to country and region to region, which changes the terms of some of these business relationships.\n\nAfter 15 or so years of the Internet economy, the digital music industry platforms like [[iTunes]], [[Spotify]], and [[Google Play Music|Google Play]] are major improvements over the early illegal file sharing days. However, the multitude of service offerings and revenue models make it difficult to understand the true value of each and what they can deliver for musicians and music companies. As well, there are major transparency problems throughout the music industry caused by outdated technology. With the emerging of new business models as streaming platforms, and online music services, a large amount of data is processed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6627418/what-a-mess-new-report-from-berklee-college-of-music-looks-to-fix-an-aging |title=What a Mess: New Report From Berklee College of Music Looks to Fix an Aging, Fractured Business |publisher=Billboard |date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> Access to [[big data]] may increase transparency in the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2015/08/transparency-in-the-music-industry.html |title=Creating Transparency In The Music Industry |website=Hypebot.com |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Sales statistics==\n{{Further|List of largest music markets}}\n\n===Digital album volume sales growth in 2014===\nAccording to IFPI,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf |title=Digital Music Report 2014 |date= |page=9 |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref> the global digital album sales grew by 6.9% in 2014.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Among the many individuals and organizations that operate in the industry are: the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s who create new songs and musical pieces; the [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[conducting|conductors]] and [[bandleader]]s who perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell [[sound recording|recorded music]] and/or [[sheet music]] (e.g., [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]], [[Record producer|music producers]], [[recording studios]], [[Audio engineering|engineers]], [[record label]]s, retail and [[online music store]]s, [[performance rights organization]]s); and those that help organize and present [[live music]] performances ([[sound engineer]]s, [[talent agent|booking agents]], [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]], [[music venue]]s, [[road crew]]).\n\nThe industry also includes a range of professionals who assist singers and musicians with their music careers ([[talent manager]]s, [[artists and repertoire]] managers, [[business manager]]s, [[entertainment law]]yers); those who broadcast audio or video music content ([[satellite radio|satellite]], [[internet radio|Internet radio stations]], [[radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] and [[television broadcasting|TV stations]]); [[music journalist]]s and [[music critic]]s; [[DJ]]s; [[music education|music educators and teachers]]; [[musical instrument]] manufacturers; as well as many others. In addition to the businesses and artists who work in the music industry to make a profit or income, there is a range of organizations that also play an important role in the music industry, including musician's unions (e.g., [[American Federation of Musicians]]), not-for-profit performance-rights organizations (e.g., [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]) and other associations (e.g., [[International Alliance for Women in Music]], a non-profit organization that advocates for [[Women in music|women composers and musicians]]).\n\nThe modern Western music industry emerged between the 1930s and 1950s, when [[Gramophone record|records]] replaced [[sheet music]] as the most important product in the music business. In the commercial world, \"the recording industry\"\u2014a reference to [[sound recording|recording performances of songs and pieces]] and selling the recordings\u2013began to be used as a loose synonym for \"the music industry\". In the 2000s, a majority of the music market is controlled by three major corporate labels: the French-owned [[Universal Music Group]], the Japanese-owned [[Sony Music Entertainment]],<ref name=\"sonybmg\">Sony Corporation announced October 1, 2008 that it had completed the acquisition of Bertelsmann's 50% stake in Sony BMG, which was originally announced on August 5, 2008.

The largest portion of the live music market for concerts and tours is controlled by [[Live Nation]], the largest promoter and [[music venue]] owner. [[Live Nation]] is a former subsidiary of [[iHeartMedia|iHeartMedia Inc]], which is the largest owner of radio stations in the [[United States]].\n\nIn the first decades of the 2000s, the music industry underwent drastic changes with the advent of widespread digital distribution of music via the [[Internet]] (which includes both illegal [[file sharing]] of songs and legal music purchases in [[online music store]]s). A conspicuous indicator of these changes is total music sales: since 2000, sales of recorded music have dropped off substantially<ref>{{cite news | title=The Music Industry | url=http://www.economist.com/background/displayBackground.cfm?story_id=10498664 | date=October 15, 2008 | work= The Economist\n}}</ref><ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite web| last=Goldman | first=David| date=February 3, 2010| title=Music's lost decade: Sales cut in half.| url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/02/news/companies/napster_music_industry/\n}}</ref> while [[live music]] has increased in importance.<ref name=\"Live Nation\">\n{{cite journal| last = Seabrook | first = John | authorlink = John Seabrook| title = The Price of the Ticket | series = Annals of Entertainment | date = August 10, 2009 | journal = [[The New Yorker]] | url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/10/090810fa_fact_seabrook | page = 34 }}</ref> In 2011, the largest recorded music retailer in the world was now a digital, [[Internet]]-based platform operated by a computer company: [[Apple Inc.]]'s online [[iTunes Store]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailywireless.org/2011/02/14/mobile-world-congress-2011/ | title = Mobile World Congress 2011 | quote = \"Amazon is now the world's biggest book retailer.

Pictured is the hand-written music manuscript for a French [[Ars subtilior]] chanson (song) from the late 1300s about love, entitled ''Belle, bonne, sage'', by Baude Cordier. The [[music notation]] is unusual in that it is written in a heart shape, with red notes indicating rhythmic [[#Notational characteristics|alterations]].]]\nMusic publishing using machine-printed [[sheet music]] developed during the [[Renaissance music]] era in the mid-15th century. The development of music publication followed the evolution of [[printing]] technologies that were first developed for printing regular [[book]]s. After the mid-15th century,  mechanical techniques for printing sheet music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg Bible]] was printed. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. To copy music notation by hand was a very costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular (non-religious) music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy aristocrats. Examples include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] of Italian [[Trecento]] music and the [[Chantilly Codex]] of French [[Ars subtilior]] music.\n\nThe use of printing enabled sheet music to reproduced much more quickly and at a much lower cost than hand-copying music notation. This helped musical styles to spread to other cities and countries more quickly, and it also enabled music to be spread to more distant areas. Prior to the invention of music printing, a composer's music might only be known in the city she lived in and its surrounding towns, because only wealthy aristocrats would be able to afford to have hand copies made of her music. With music printing, though, a composer's music could be printed and sold at a relatively low cost to purchasers from a wide geographic area. As sheet music of major composer's pieces and songs began to be printed and distributed in a wider area, this enabled composers and listeners to hear new styles and forms of music. A German composer could buy songs written by an Italian or English composer, and an Italian composer could buy pieces written by Dutch composers and learn how they wrote music. This led to more blending of musical styles from different countries and regions.\n\nThe pioneer of modern music printing was [[Ottaviano Petrucci]]  (born in Fossombrone in 1466 \u2013 died in 1539 in Venice ), a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. [[Venice]] was one of the major business and music centers during this period. His ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', a collection of chansons printed in 1501, is commonly misidentified as the first book of sheet music printed from movable type. Actually that distinction belongs to the Roman printer Ulrich Han's ''Missale Romanum'' of 1476. Nevertheless, Petrucci's later work was extraordinary for the complexity of his white mensural notation and the smallness of his font. He printed the first book of [[polyphony]] (music with two or more independent melodic lines) using movable type. He also published numerous works by the most highly regarded composers of the Renaissance, including [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Antoine Brumel]]. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the [[Renaissance music]] era. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean and readable results, although it was time-consuming and expensive.\n\nUntil the 18th century, the processes of formal composition and of the printing of music took place for the most part with the support of [[patronage]] from [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] and [[Religion|churches]]. In the mid-to-late 18th century, performers and composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] began to seek more commercial opportunities to market their music and performances to the general public. After Mozart's death, his wife ([[Constanze Weber]]) continued the process of commercialization of his music through an unprecedented series of memorial concerts, selling his manuscripts, and collaborating with her second husband, [[Georg Nissen]], on a biography of Mozart.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glover |first=Jane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/02/classicalmusicandopera |title=Dear Constanze &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.png|thumb|right|200px|An example of mechanically printed sheet music.]]\n\nIn the 19th century, [[sheet music|sheet-music]] publishers dominated the music industry. Prior to the invention of [[sound recording]] technologies, the main way for music lovers to hear new symphonies and [[opera]] arias (songs) was to buy the sheet music (often arranged for piano or for a small chamber music group) and perform the music in a living room, using friends who were amateur musicians and singers. In the United States, the music industry arose in tandem with the rise of \"[[black face]]\" [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a [[black people|black person]]. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of negative [[racial stereotype]]s of African-American people.<ref>For the \"darky\"/\"coon\" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E. Franey's annotated edition of Yone Noguchi, ''The American Diary of a Japanese Girl'', Temple University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59213-555-2}}. See also Lewis A. Erenberg (1984), ''Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890\u20131930'', University of Chicago Press, p. 73, {{ISBN|0-226-21515-6}}.

Ronald Green (2000), ''Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux'', Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, {{ISBN|0-253-33753-4}}; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific \"coon\" archetype.</ref>\n\nIn the late part of the century the group of music publishers and songwriters which dominated [[popular music]] in the United States became known as [[Tin Pan Alley]]. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], and a plaque (see [[#plaque|below]]) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it. The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of [[Manhattan]]. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear-cut. Some date it to the start of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s when the [[phonograph]] and radio supplanted [[sheet music]] as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of [[rock & roll]].\n\n===Advent of recorded music and radio broadcasting===\n[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief on a cylinder phonograph in 1916.]]\n[[File:Donald Manson working as an employee of the Marconi Company.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A radio broadcasting system from 1906.]]\nAt the dawn of the early 20th century, the development of [[sound recording]] began to function as a [[disruptive technology]] to the commercial interests which published sheet music. During the sheet music era, if a regular person wanted to hear popular new songs, he or she would buy the sheet music and play it at home on a piano, or learn the song at home while playing the [[accompaniment]] part on piano or guitar. Commercially released [[phonograph]] records of musical performances, which became available starting in the late 1880s, and later the onset of widespread [[radio broadcasting]], starting in the 1920s, forever changed the way music was heard and listened to. Opera houses, concert halls, and clubs continued to produce music and musicians and singers continued to perform live, but the power of radio allowed bands, ensembles and singers who had previously performed only in one region to become popular on a nationwide and sometimes even a worldwide scale. Moreover, whereas attendance at the top symphony and opera concerts was formerly restricted to high-income people in a pre-radio world, with [[broadcast radio]], a much larger wider range of people, including lower and middle-income people could hear the best [[orchestra]]s, [[big band]]s, popular singers and opera shows.\n\nThe \"record industry\" eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force. A multitude of record labels came and went. Some noteworthy labels of the earlier decades include the [[Columbia Records]], Crystalate, [[Decca Records]], Edison Bell, [[The Gramophone Company]], Invicta, Kalliope, [[Path\u00e9]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/vintage78rpm/great78/Early_Record_Labels.htm |title=Early Record Label History |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> Many record companies died out as quickly as they had formed, and by the end of the 1980s, the \"Big six\" \u2014 [[EMI]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[PolyGram]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and [[MCA Records|MCA]] \u2014 dominated the industry. [[Sony]] bought [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] in 1987 and changed its name to Sony Music in 1991. In mid-1998, [[PolyGram|PolyGram Music Group]] merged with MCA Music Entertainment creating what we now know as [[Universal Music Group]]. Since then, Sony and BMG merged in 2004,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3908405.stm \"Sony and BMG merger backed by EU\"], BBC News, July 19, 2004</ref> and Universal took over the majority of EMI's recorded music interests in 2012.<ref>Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/21/universal-emi-takeover-approved \"Universal's \u00a31.2bn EMI takeover approved \u2013 with conditions\"], ''The Guardian'' (London),</ref> [[EMI Music Publishing]], also once part of the now defunct British conglomerate, is now co-owned by Sony as a subsidiary of [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emi-music-publishing-sold-sony-atv-estate-michael-jackson-343848 \"Sold!

Forming an [[independent record label]], or \"indie\" label, or signing to such a label continues to be a popular choice for up-and-coming musicians, especially in genres like [[hardcore punk]] and [[extreme metal]], despite the fact that indies cannot offer the same financial backing of major labels. Some bands prefer to sign with an indie label, because these labels typically give performers more artistic freedom.\n\n===Rise of digital and online distribution===\n{{Main|2000s in the music industry|2010s in the music industry}}\n{{ external media\n| topic = [[RIAA]] U.S. Recorded Music Sales Charts (Interactive); Revenue and Volumes by Format.

It has undergone dramatic changes in the first decades of the 21st century. However, the majority of the participants in the music industry still fulfill their traditional roles, which are described below.<ref>All of the information in this section can be found in:* {{Krasilovsky et al 2007}}</ref> There are three types of [[property]] that are created and sold by the recording industry: [[musical composition|compositions]] (songs, pieces, lyrics), [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] (audio and video) and media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]] or [[MP3]]s, and [[DVD]]s). There may be many recordings of a single composition and a single recording will typically be distributed via many media. For example, the song \"[[My Way]]\" is owned by its composers, [[Paul Anka]] and [[Claude Fran\u00e7ois]], [[Frank Sinatra]]'s recording of \"My Way\" is owned by [[Capitol Records]], [[Sid Vicious]]'s recording of \"My Way\" is owned by [[Virgin Records]], and the millions of CDs and vinyl records that can play these recordings are owned by millions of individual consumers.\n\n===Compositions===\n\n[[Song]]s, instrumental pieces and other musical compositions are created by [[songwriter]]s or [[composer]]s and are originally owned by the composer, although they may be sold or the rights may be otherwise assigned. For example, in the case of [[work for hire]], the composition is owned immediately by another party. Traditionally, the copyright owner [[licensed|licenses]] or \"assigns\" some of their rights to [[publishing companies]], by means of a [[publishing contract]]. The publishing company (or a collection society operating on behalf of many such publishers, songwriters and composers) collects fees (known as \"[[Music royalties|publishing royalties]]\") when the composition is used. A portion of the royalties are paid by the publishing company to the copyright owner, depending on the terms of the contract. [[Sheet music]] provides an income stream that is paid exclusively to the composers and their publishing company. Typically (although not universally), the publishing company will provide the owner with an [[advance payment|advance]] against future earnings when the publishing contract is signed. A publishing company will also promote the compositions, such as by acquiring song \"placements\" on [[television]] or in [[film]]s.\n\n===Recordings===\n[[File:Sound Gobo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A musician in a recording studio.]]\nRecordings are created by [[recording artist]]s, which includes [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s (including [[session musician]]s) and [[musical ensemble]]s (e.g., [[backing band]]s, [[rhythm section]]s, [[orchestra]]s, etc.) usually with the assistance and guidance from [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s. They were traditionally made in [[recording studio]]s (which are rented for a daily or hourly rate) in a [[recording session]]. In the 21st century, advances in digital recording technology have allowed many producers and artists to create \"[[home studio]]s\" using high-end computers and digital recording programs like [[Pro Tools]], bypassing the traditional role of the commercial recording studio. The [[record producer]] oversees all aspects of the recording, making many of the logistic, financial and artistic decisions in cooperation with the artists. The record producer has a range of different responsibilities including choosing material and/or working with the composers, hiring session musicians, helping to [[musical arrangement|arrange]] the songs, overseeing the musician performances, and directing the audio engineer during recording and mixing to get the best sound. [[Audio engineer]]s (including [[recording engineer|recording]], [[mixing engineer|mixing]] and [[mastering engineer]]s) are responsible for ensuring good audio quality during the recording. They select and set up microphones and use [[effects unit]]s and [[mixing console]]s to adjust the sound and level of the music.  A recording session may also require the services of an [[arranger]], [[orchestrator]], [[studio musician]]s, [[session musician]]s, [[vocal coach]]es, or even a discreetly-hired [[ghostwriter|ghostwriter to help with the lyrics or songwriting]].\n[[File:Ben Feggans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A studio engineer working with an [[audio mixer]] in a recording studio.]]\n\nRecordings are (traditionally) owned by [[record companies]]. Some artists own their own record companies (e.g., [[Ani DiFranco]]). A [[recording contract]] specifies the business relationship between a recording artist and the record company. In a traditional contract, the company provides an advance to the artist who agrees to record music that will be owned by the company. The [[A&R]] department of a record company is responsible for finding new talent and overseeing the recording process. The company pays for the recording costs and the cost of [[radio promotion|promoting]] and [[marketing]] the record. For physical media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]]), the company also pays to [[manufacture]] and [[distribution (business)|distribute]] the physical recordings. Smaller record companies (known as \"[[independent record label|indies]]\") will form business relationships with other companies to handle many of these tasks. The record company pays the recording artist a portion of the income from the sale of the recordings, also known as a \"royalty\", but this is distinct from the publishing royalties described above. This portion is similar to a percentage, but may be limited or expanded by a number of factors (such as free goods, recoupable expenses, bonuses, etc.) that are specified by the record contract. [[Session musician]]s and [[orchestra]] members (as well as a few recording artists in special markets) are under contract to provide [[work for hire]]; they are typically only paid one-time fees or regular wages for their services, rather than ongoing royalties.\n\n===Media===\n\nPhysical media (such as CDs or vinyl records) are sold by music [[retail]]ers and are owned by the consumers after they buy them. Buyers do not typically have the right to make digital copies from CDs or other media they buy, or rent or lease the CDs, because they do not own the recording on the CD, they only own the individual physical CD. A music distributor delivers crates of the packaged physical media from the manufacturer to the retailer and maintains commercial relationships with retailers and record companies. The music retailer pays the distributor, who in turn pays the [[record company]] for the recordings. The record company pays [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] to the publisher and composer via a collection society. The record company then pays royalties, if contractually obligated, to the recording artist. In the case of digital downloads or online [[streaming media|streaming]] of music, there is no physical media other than the consumer's computer memory on his or her portable media player or laptop. For this reason, artists such as Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Kings of Leon, and others have called for legal changes that would deny social media the right to stream their music without paying them royalties.<ref name=\"Knopper2009\" /> In the digital and online music market of the 2000s, the distributor becomes optional. Large online shops may pay the labels directly, but digital distributors do exist to provide distribution services for vendors large and small. When purchasing digital downloads or listening to music streaming, the consumer may be required to agree to record company and vendor licensing terms beyond those which are inherent in [[copyright]]; for example, some services may allow consumers to freely share the recording, but others may restrict the user to storing the music on a specific number of hard drives or devices.\n\n===Broadcast, soundtrack and streaming===\n\nWhen a recording is broadcast (either on radio or by a [[background music]] service such as [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]), [[performance rights organisation]]s (such as the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in the US, SOCAN in Canada, or [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]] in the UK), collect a third type of royalty known as a performance royalty, which is paid to songwriters, composers and recording artists. This royalty is typically much smaller than publishing or [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]]. Within the past decade, more than \"15 to 30 percent\" of tracks on streaming services are unidentified with a specific artist. Jeff Price says \"Audiam, an online music streaming service, has made over several hundred thousand dollars in the past year from collecting royalties from online streaming.<ref name=\"billboard.com\" /> According to Ken Levitan, manager from Kings of Leon, Cheap Trick and others, \"Youtube has become radio for kids\". Because of the overuse of YouTube and offline streaming, album sales have fallen by 60 percent in the past few years.<ref name=\"Knopper2009\" /> When recordings are used in [[television]] and [[film]], the composer and their publishing company are typically paid through a [[synchronization rights|synchronization license]]. In the 2000s, online subscription services (such as [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]) also provide an income stream directly to record companies, and through them, to artists, contracts permitting.\n\n===Live music===\n\n[[File:Pro2Type - CSD Stra\u00dfenfest K\u00f6ln 2013-1759.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A live musical performance at [[Cologne Pride]], 2013.]]\nA [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] brings together a performing artist and a [[Music venue|venue]] owner and arranges contracts. A [[booking agency]] represents the artist to promoters, makes deals and books performances. Consumers usually buy tickets either from the venue or from a ticket distribution service such as [[Ticketmaster]]. In the US, [[Live Nation]] is the dominant company in all of these roles: they own most of the large venues in the US, they are the largest promoter, and they own [[Ticketmaster]]. Choices about where and when to tour are decided by the [[artist manager|artist's management]] and the artist, sometimes in consultation with the [[record company]]. Record companies may finance a tour in the hopes that it will help promote the sale of recordings. However, in the 21st century, it has become more common to release recordings to promote ticket sales for live shows, rather than book tours to promote the sales of recordings.\n\nMajor, successful artists will usually employ a [[road crew]]: a semi-permanent touring organization that travels with the artist during concert series. The road crew is headed by a [[tour manager]]. Crew members provides [[stage lighting]], [[Audio engineering|live sound reinforcement]], [[guitar technician|musical instrument tuning and maintenance]], [[bodyguard]] for the artist and transportation of the equipment and music ensemble members. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager, hairdressers, makeup artists and [[catering]] staff. Local crews are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage. On a small tour with less financial backing, all of these jobs may be handled by just a few roadies or by the musicians themselves. Bands signed with small \"indie\" labels and bands in genres such as [[hardcore punk]] are more likely to do tours without a road crew, or with minimal support.\n\n===Artist management, representation and staff===\n\nArtists such as singers and musicians may hire a number of people from other fields to assist them with their career. The [[artist manager]] oversees all aspects of an artist's career in exchange for a percentage of the artist's income. An [[entertainment law]]yer assists them with the details of their contracts with record companies and other deals. A [[business manager]] handles financial transactions, taxes and bookkeeping. Unions, such as [[AFTRA]] and the [[American Federation of Musicians]] in the U.S. provide [[health insurance]] and instrument insurance for musicians. A successful artist functions in the market as a [[brand]] and, as such, they may derive income from many other streams, such as [[merchandise]], personal endorsements, appearances (without performing) at events or Internet-based services.<ref>http://info.dcc-studios.com/blog/why-branding-is-important-for-djs-and-producers/</ref> These are typically overseen by the artist's [[artist manager|manager]] and take the form of relationships between the artist and companies that specialize in these products. Singers may also hire a [[vocal coach]], [[Dance teacher|dance instructor]], [[Drama teacher|acting coach]], [[personal trainer]] or [[life coach]] to help them.\n\n===Emerging business models===\n\nIn the 2000s, traditional lines that once divided singers, instrumentalists, publishers, record companies, distributors, retail and consumer electronics have become blurred or erased. Artists may record in a [[home studio]] using a high-end [[laptop]] and a digital recording program such as [[Pro Tools]] or use [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for an expensive studio recording session without involving a record company. Artists may choose to exclusively promote and market themselves using only free online video sharing services such as [[YouTube]] or using [[social media]] websites, bypassing traditional promotion and marketing by a record company. In the 2000s, [[consumer electronics]] and [[computer]] companies such as [[Apple Computer]] have become [[Online music store|digital music retailers]]. New digital music distribution technologies and the trends towards using [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of older songs in new songs or blending different songs to create [[mashup (music)|\"mashup\"]] recordings have also forced both governments and the music industry to re-examine the definitions of [[intellectual property]] and the rights of all the parties involved. Also compounding the issue of defining copyright boundaries is the fact that the definition of \"royalty\" and \"copyright\" varies from country to country and region to region, which changes the terms of some of these business relationships.\n\nAfter 15 or so years of the Internet economy, the digital music industry platforms like [[iTunes]], [[Spotify]], and [[Google Play Music|Google Play]] are major improvements over the early illegal file sharing days. However, the multitude of service offerings and revenue models make it difficult to understand the true value of each and what they can deliver for musicians and music companies. As well, there are major transparency problems throughout the music industry caused by outdated technology. With the emerging of new business models as streaming platforms, and online music services, a large amount of data is processed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6627418/what-a-mess-new-report-from-berklee-college-of-music-looks-to-fix-an-aging |title=What a Mess: New Report From Berklee College of Music Looks to Fix an Aging, Fractured Business |publisher=Billboard |date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> Access to [[big data]] may increase transparency in the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2015/08/transparency-in-the-music-industry.html |title=Creating Transparency In The Music Industry |website=Hypebot.com |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Sales statistics==\n{{Further|List of largest music markets}}\n\n===Digital album volume sales growth in 2014===\nAccording to IFPI,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf |title=Digital Music Report 2014 |date= |page=9 |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref> the global digital album sales grew by 6.9% in 2014.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Mascots are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products, such as the [[Trix Rabbit|rabbit]] used in [[advertising]] and [[marketing]] for the [[General Mills]] brand of [[breakfast cereal]], [[Trix (cereal)|Trix]].\n\nIn the world of sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team mascots are often related to their respective team [[athletic nickname|nicknames]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halcyon.com/marcs/mascot.html|title=Marc's Collection of Mascots: Introduction|website=Halcyon.com|accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> This is especially true when the team's nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be [[anthropomorphism|made to have humanlike characteristics]]. For more abstract nicknames, the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot. For example, the [[sport|athletic]] teams of the [[University of Alabama]] are nicknamed the [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Crimson Tide]], while their mascot is an elephant named [[Big Al (mascot)|Big Al]]. Team mascots may take the form of a [[logo]], person, live animal, inanimate object, or a [[costumed character]], and often appear at team matches and other related events, sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to [[children]]. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' mascot, the [[Phillie Phanatic]], and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]' mascot, [[Gritty (mascot)|Gritty]].\n\nCostumed mascots are commonplace, and are regularly used as [[good faith|goodwill]] [[ambassador]]s in the [[community]] for their team, [[company]], or [[organization]] such as the U.S. Forest Service's [[Smokey Bear]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2019}}\nIt was initially sports organizations that first thought of using [[animal]]s as a form of mascot to bring entertainment and excitement for their spectators. Before mascots were fictional icons or people in suits, animals were mostly used in order to bring a somewhat different feel to the game and to strike fear upon the rivalry teams.\n\nAs the new era was changing and time went on, mascots evolved from predatory animals, to two-dimensional fantasy mascots, to finally what we know today, three-dimensional mascots. Stylistic changes in American [[puppetry]] in the mid-20th century, including the work of [[Jim Henson]] and [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], soon were adapted to sports mascots. It allowed people to not only have visual enjoyment but also interact physically with the mascots.\n\nMarketers quickly realized the great potential in three-dimensional mascots and took on board the costumed puppet idea. This change encouraged other companies to start creating their own mascots, resulting in mascots being a necessity amongst not only the sporting industry but for other organisations<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'mascot' originates from the French term 'mascotte' which means [[Amulet|lucky charm]]. This was used to describe anything that brought luck to a household. The word was first recorded in 1867 and popularised by a French composer [[Edmond Audran]] who wrote the opera ''[[La mascotte]]'', performed in December 1880. The word entered the English language in 1881. However, before this, the terms were familiar to the people of France as a slang word used by gamblers. The term is a derivative of the word 'masco' meaning sorceress or witch. Before the 19th century, the word 'mascot' was associated with inanimate objects that would be commonly seen such as a lock of hair or a figurehead on a sailing ship.

Mascots are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products, such as the [[Trix Rabbit|rabbit]] used in [[advertising]] and [[marketing]] for the [[General Mills]] brand of [[breakfast cereal]], [[Trix (cereal)|Trix]].\n\nIn the world of sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team mascots are often related to their respective team [[athletic nickname|nicknames]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halcyon.com/marcs/mascot.html|title=Marc's Collection of Mascots: Introduction|website=Halcyon.com|accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> This is especially true when the team's nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be [[anthropomorphism|made to have humanlike characteristics]]. For more abstract nicknames, the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot. For example, the [[sport|athletic]] teams of the [[University of Alabama]] are nicknamed the [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Crimson Tide]], while their mascot is an elephant named [[Big Al (mascot)|Big Al]]. Team mascots may take the form of a [[logo]], person, live animal, inanimate object, or a [[costumed character]], and often appear at team matches and other related events, sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to [[children]]. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' mascot, the [[Phillie Phanatic]], and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]' mascot, [[Gritty (mascot)|Gritty]].\n\nCostumed mascots are commonplace, and are regularly used as [[good faith|goodwill]] [[ambassador]]s in the [[community]] for their team, [[company]], or [[organization]] such as the U.S. Forest Service's [[Smokey Bear]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2019}}\nIt was initially sports organizations that first thought of using [[animal]]s as a form of mascot to bring entertainment and excitement for their spectators. Before mascots were fictional icons or people in suits, animals were mostly used in order to bring a somewhat different feel to the game and to strike fear upon the rivalry teams.\n\nAs the new era was changing and time went on, mascots evolved from predatory animals, to two-dimensional fantasy mascots, to finally what we know today, three-dimensional mascots. Stylistic changes in American [[puppetry]] in the mid-20th century, including the work of [[Jim Henson]] and [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], soon were adapted to sports mascots. It allowed people to not only have visual enjoyment but also interact physically with the mascots.\n\nMarketers quickly realized the great potential in three-dimensional mascots and took on board the costumed puppet idea. This change encouraged other companies to start creating their own mascots, resulting in mascots being a necessity amongst not only the sporting industry but for other organisations<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'mascot' originates from the French term 'mascotte' which means [[Amulet|lucky charm]]. This was used to describe anything that brought luck to a household. The word was first recorded in 1867 and popularised by a French composer [[Edmond Audran]] who wrote the opera ''[[La mascotte]]'', performed in December 1880. The word entered the English language in 1881. However, before this, the terms were familiar to the people of France as a slang word used by gamblers. The term is a derivative of the word 'masco' meaning sorceress or witch. Before the 19th century, the word 'mascot' was associated with inanimate objects that would be commonly seen such as a lock of hair or a figurehead on a sailing ship. But from then to the present day, the term has been seen to be associated with good luck animals, objects etc.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Mascots-3464.html|title=Mascots|website=Fisu.net|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/hmwhm/mascot/0 |title=Where Are You From? - Credo Reference |website=Search.credoreference.com |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n==Choices and identities==\n{{Weasel|date=March 2009}}\n[[File:Ronald Reagan with the San Diego \"chicken\".jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[San Diego Chicken]], portrayed by Ted Giannoulas, was a staple in the [[San Diego]] area during the 1970s and 80s.

Recognizable mascots include [[Chester Cheetah]], Keebler Elf, the Fruit of the Loom Guys, Mickey Mouse, Pizza Pizza Guy for Little Caesars, Rocky the Elf, the [[Coca-Cola]] Bear, the [[NBC]] Peacock, and the NRA's [[Eddie Eagle]].  These characters are typically known without even having to refer to the company or brand.  This is an example of [[corporate branding]], and [[soft sell]]ing a company.  Mascots are able to act as [[brand ambassador]]s where advertising is not allowed.  For example, many corporate mascots can attend non-profit events, or sports and promote their brand while entertaining the crowd.  Some mascots are simply cartoons or virtual mascots, others are characters in commercials, and others are actually created as costumes and will appear in person in front of the public at tradeshows or events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2013/02/11/all-time-best-corporate-character-mascots/id=34384/|title=All-time Best Corporate Character Mascots|date=2013-02-11|website= IPWatchdog.com {{!}} Patents & Patent Law|access-date=|first = Renee C.|last = Quinn}}</ref>\n\n==School mascots==\n{{See also|List of college mascots in the United States}}\nAmerican high schools, colleges, and even middle and elementary schools typically have mascots.

Other British military mascots include a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and a pair of [[ferret]]s.\n\nThe Norwegian [[Royal Guard]] adopted a [[king penguin]] named [[Nils Olav]] as its mascot on the occasion of a visit to Edinburgh by its regimental band. The (very large) penguin remains resident at [[Edinburgh Zoo]] and has been formally promoted by one rank on the occasion of each subsequent visit to Britain by the band or other detachments of the Guard.

The mascots are usually found on album covers or merchandise such as band T-shirts, but can also make appearances in live shows or music videos. A famous example of a band mascot is [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] of the [[English people|English]] heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]]. Eddie is a [[zombie]]-like creature which is personified in different forms on all of the band's albums, most of its singles and some of its promotional merchandise. Eddie is also known to make live appearances, especially during the song \"Iron Maiden\". Another notable example of a mascot in music is Skeleton Sam of [[The Grateful Dead]]. South Korean hip hop band [[B.A.P (band)|B.A.P]] uses rabbits named Matoki as their mascot, each bunny a different color representing each member. Although rabbits have an innocent image, BAP gives off a tough image. Hip hop artist [[Kanye West]] used to use a teddy bear named Dropout Bear as his mascot; Dropout Bear has appeared on the cover of West's first three studio albums, and served as the main character of West's music video, \"[[Good Morning (Kanye West song)|Good Morning]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Car mascot]]\n* [[Fursuit]]\n* [[List of mascots]] (college, computing, commercial, sports, public-service, television and movie, computer and video games, political parties)\n* [[Good luck charm|Lucky charm]]\n* [[Mascot Hall of Fame]]\n* [[National emblem]], [[National personification]], [[List of national animals|National animals]]\n* [[Totem]]\n* [[Costume]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mascots|lcfirst=yes}}\n* [https://www.mascotdb.com/ Mascot Database - the searchable team name database]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070716135910/http://chl.be/mascots/ List of Free and Open Source software mascots]\n* [http://www.gethow.org/benefits-of-brand-mascots-in-business Benefits of Brand Mascots in Business]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155516/http://www.pixelrushstudio.com/mascot-design-brand-recognition/ Benefits of Mascot Designs] in Brand Recognition\n* [http://thehistorytavern.blogspot.com/2011/03/unique-university-mascots.html Unique University Mascots and The History Behind Them at The History Tavern]\n\n[[Category:Mascots| ]]\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Branding terminology]]\n[[Category:Sports occupations and roles]]\n[[Category:Uniforms]]\n", "name_user": "Zlobnik Urac", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot"}

Mike Harrison of ''Billboard'' explained that when major artists release albums, more than one song from the album can become popular at the same time.<ref name=bbrock /> The first number-one song on the Top Tracks chart was \"[[I Can't Stand It (song)|I Can't Stand It]]\" by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=bbrock />\n\nIn September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was discontinued and Top Tracks was renamed Top Rock Tracks.<ref name=Whitburn>{{cite book | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2002 | title=Rock Tracks | isbn=0-89820-153-5 | page=9}}</ref> It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine.

Rock Albums was a survey of the top albums on American rock radio, while Top Tracks listed the top individual songs being played. Mike Harrison of ''Billboard'' explained that when major artists release albums, more than one song from the album can become popular at the same time.<ref name=bbrock /> The first number-one song on the Top Tracks chart was \"[[I Can't Stand It (song)|I Can't Stand It]]\" by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=bbrock />\n\nIn September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was discontinued and Top Tracks was renamed Top Rock Tracks.<ref name=Whitburn>{{cite book | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2002 | title=Rock Tracks | isbn=0-89820-153-5 | page=9}}</ref> It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine.

As a result, this data showed that many songs could spend months to over a year on the Album Rock Tracks chart. ''Billboard'' decided to drop to a 40-position chart (still its current format), and songs that fell out of the top 20 and after spending 20 weeks on the chart were moved to a new 10-position recurrent chart.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 27, 1992 |title=Album Rock Chart Changes |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The recurrent chart was scrapped two years later, but not the methodology.\n\nTo differentiate between classic and alternative album rock radio formats, ''Billboard'' changed the name of the chart to Mainstream Rock Tracks beginning with issue dated April 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 13, 1996 |title=Name Changed on Album Rock Tracks |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=15 |pages=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The Mainstream Rock Tracks chart did not appear in the print edition of ''Billboard'' from its issue dated August 2, 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2, 2003 |first=Keith |last=Girard |title=The Evolution Continues |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=115 |issue=31 |pages=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> being accessible only through the magazine's subscription-based website, Billboard.biz.
