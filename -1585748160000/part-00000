By modulating [[retinoblastoma protein]] activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature [[hair cell]]s that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. [[Retinoblastoma protein]]s suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the [[cell cycle]], thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog, identified as an important regulator of Rb, may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.<ref name=\"Lu_2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu N, Chen Y, Wang Z, Chen G, Lin Q, Chen ZY, Li H | title = Sonic hedgehog initiates cochlear hair cell regeneration through downregulation of retinoblastoma protein | journal = Biochem.

Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45&nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|kDa]] and is referred to as the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short [[signal peptide|signal sequence]] at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the [[signal recognition particle]] during the translocation into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), the first step in protein [[secretion]]. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by [[signal peptidase]] in the ER.

Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new 737 MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard both flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. Ethiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] until it received new evidence of accident similarities on March 13. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 2. MCAS -->\nAfter the first accident, Boeing instructed pilots to follow an [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|existing procedure]] to recover from [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] caused by a new flight control system, [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which had been omitted from crew manuals and training. In a private analysis, the FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|predicted further accidents]] if MCAS was not revised, but believed that the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] criticized Boeing's \"culture of concealment\" during certification and in the aftermath of both accidents.<section end=\"summary\" />\n<!-- THE SECTION TAGS ARE PLACED HERE TO ALLOW TRANSCLUSION OF THIS INTRODUCTION into Boeing 737 MAX EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE -->\n<!-- The tags must stay in these locations next to the notes. -->\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* On {{date|29 October 2018|MDY}}, a 737 MAX 8 operating [[Lion Air Flight 610]] crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing 189 people, leading Boeing to publicly unveil the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]], a new automated flight control on the MAX that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]], but was omitted from crew manuals and training.<ref name=Flight13mar2020/>\n* On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued a [[service bulletin]] warning that with \"erroneous {{abbr|AOA|angle of attack}} data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\" which \"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|Runaway stabilizer and manual trim]] procedure.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/boeing-nearing-737-max-fleet-bulletin-on-aoa-warning-after-lion-air-crash/ |title= Boeing nearing 737 Max fleet bulletin on AoA warning after Lion Air crash |date= November 7, 2018 |work= The Air Current |author= Jon Ostrower}}</ref> \n* On November 7, 2018, the FAA issued an [[Emergency airworthiness directive]] requiring revising \"the {{abbr|AFM|aircraft flight manual}} to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\" when \"repeated nose-down trim commands\" are caused by \"an erroneously high single AOA sensor\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf |title= Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-23-51 |date= November 7, 2018 |publisher= FAA}}</ref>\n* On December 3, 2018, the FAA conducted an unpublished \"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology\u201d (TARAM) [[Boeing 737 MAX certification#Boeing 737 safety analysis|analysis]] that concluded, \"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 Max could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet\u201d;

Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />\nIn March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new 737 MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard both flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. Ethiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] until it received new evidence of accident similarities on March 13. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 2. MCAS -->\nAfter the first accident, Boeing instructed pilots to follow an [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|existing procedure]] to recover from [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] caused by a new flight control system, [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which had been omitted from crew manuals and training. In a private analysis, the FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|predicted further accidents]] if MCAS was not revised, but believed that the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] criticized Boeing's \"culture of concealment\" during certification and in the aftermath of both accidents.<section end=\"summary\" />\n<!-- THE SECTION TAGS ARE PLACED HERE TO ALLOW TRANSCLUSION OF THIS INTRODUCTION into Boeing 737 MAX EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE -->\n<!-- The tags must stay in these locations next to the notes. -->\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* On {{date|29 October 2018|MDY}}, a 737 MAX 8 operating [[Lion Air Flight 610]] crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing 189 people, leading Boeing to publicly unveil the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]], a new automated flight control on the MAX that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]], but was omitted from crew manuals and training.<ref name=Flight13mar2020/>\n* On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued a [[service bulletin]] warning that with \"erroneous {{abbr|AOA|angle of attack}} data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\" which \"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|Runaway stabilizer and manual trim]] procedure.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/boeing-nearing-737-max-fleet-bulletin-on-aoa-warning-after-lion-air-crash/ |title= Boeing nearing 737 Max fleet bulletin on AoA warning after Lion Air crash |date= November 7, 2018 |work= The Air Current |author= Jon Ostrower}}</ref> \n* On November 7, 2018, the FAA issued an [[Emergency airworthiness directive]] requiring revising \"the {{abbr|AFM|aircraft flight manual}} to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\" when \"repeated nose-down trim commands\" are caused by \"an erroneously high single AOA sensor\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf |title= Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-23-51 |date= November 7, 2018 |publisher= FAA}}</ref>\n* On December 3, 2018, the FAA conducted an unpublished \"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology\u201d (TARAM) [[Boeing 737 MAX certification#Boeing 737 safety analysis|analysis]] that concluded, \"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 Max could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet\u201d;

Pictures]] on December 25, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, and Foxx received a nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]] at the [[26th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, idealistic young [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] graduate [[Bryan Stevenson]] travels to [[Alabama]] hoping to help fight for poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. He meets with Eva Ansley and founds the [[Equal Justice Initiative]], then travels to a prison to meet its [[death row]] inmates. He meets [[Walter McMillian|Walter \"Johnny D.\" McMillian]], an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, a white woman. Stevenson looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers, who provided highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own pending trial.\n\nStevenson's first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid; Chapman dismisses him without even looking at Stevenson's notes. Stevenson then asks McMillian family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he was with a witness who corroborated Myers' testimony the day of the murder, which would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart. When Stevenson submits Houston's testimony, police arrest him for perjury. While Stevenson is able to get the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated into refusing to testify in court.\n\nStevenson then approaches Myers himself, who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after police played to his fear of being burned and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillan a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught, Stevenson vents his frustrations about the case to Ansley. He appears on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rally public support in favor of McMillan, then appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillan his retrial. Stevenson then motions to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects him from his property. The day of the motion comes, and Stevenson appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to join him in his motion, the case is dismissed, and McMillan is finally reunited with his family.\n\nAn epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue to fight for justice to the present day. Until his death in 2013, McMillan remained friends with Stevenson. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's death confirmed McMillan's innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been solved.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael B.

It tells the true story of [[Walter McMillian]], who, with the help of young defense attorney [[Bryan Stevenson]], appeals his murder conviction. The film is based on the memoir of the same name, written by Stevenson.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://justmercy.eji.org |title=Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson {{!}} Bestselling Book and Adapted Film |website=JustMercy.eji.org |language=en-US |access-date=2019-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191120183622/https://justmercy.eji.org/ |archive-date=November 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Just Mercy'' had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2019, and was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on December 25, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, and Foxx received a nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]] at the [[26th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, idealistic young [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] graduate [[Bryan Stevenson]] travels to [[Alabama]] hoping to help fight for poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. He meets with Eva Ansley and founds the [[Equal Justice Initiative]], then travels to a prison to meet its [[death row]] inmates. He meets [[Walter McMillian|Walter \"Johnny D.\" McMillian]], an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, a white woman. Stevenson looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers, who provided highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own pending trial.\n\nStevenson's first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid; Chapman dismisses him without even looking at Stevenson's notes. Stevenson then asks McMillian family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he was with a witness who corroborated Myers' testimony the day of the murder, which would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart. When Stevenson submits Houston's testimony, police arrest him for perjury. While Stevenson is able to get the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated into refusing to testify in court.\n\nStevenson then approaches Myers himself, who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after police played to his fear of being burned and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillan a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught, Stevenson vents his frustrations about the case to Ansley. He appears on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rally public support in favor of McMillan, then appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillan his retrial. Stevenson then motions to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects him from his property. The day of the motion comes, and Stevenson appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to join him in his motion, the case is dismissed, and McMillan is finally reunited with his family.\n\nAn epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue to fight for justice to the present day. Until his death in 2013, McMillan remained friends with Stevenson. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's death confirmed McMillan's innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been solved.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael B.

The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going toward the performances of its cast, particularly by Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film revitalized Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s. In addition to starring in films such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']], and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Brando was a catalyst in this film for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast. At the [[45th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Brando), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (for Puzo and Coppola).

His youngest son, [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], who was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] during [[World War II]], introduces his girlfriend, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a [[popular singer]] and Vito's [[Godparent|godson]], seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his [[consigliere]], [[Tom Hagen]], to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized [[Stud (animal)|stallion]].\n\nShortly before Christmas, drug baron [[List of The Godfather series characters#Virgil Sollozzo|Sollozzo]], backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, [[Luca Brasi]], to spy on them. Brasi is [[garrote]]d to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by [[NYPD]] Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a [[The Bronx|Bronx]] restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]], a Corleone [[Caporegime|capo]], he kills both men.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities, the [[Five Families (The Godfather)|Five Families]] erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] is sheltered by [[Moe Greene]] in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding [[submachine gun]]s. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries [[List of The Godfather series characters#Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone|Apollonia]], but a [[car bomb]] intended for him takes her life.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, [[Emilio Barzini|Barzini]], Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\n\nIn 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, [[Salvatore Tessio|Tessio]], a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza immediately garrotes Carlo to death.

Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola, and expresses his  understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to the U.S., the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |title=The Godfather: A Cultural Phenomenon |url=http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007060450/http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |archivedate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> ''The Godfather'' increased Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians in the aftermath of the film and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |first=Megan |last=Gambino |date=January 31, 2012 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |access-date=May 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423232235/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |archive-date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language.

The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the [[Corleone family]] under patriarch [[Vito Corleone]] (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, [[Michael Corleone]] (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless [[American Mafia|mafia]] [[Crime boss|boss]].\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity.<ref name=mjnytgnw>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006%2C4931444 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=(New York Times) |last=Allan |first=John H. |title='Godfather' gives boost to G&W profit picture |date=April 17, 1972 |page=16, part 2 |access-date=July 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121195947/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006%2C4931444 |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes19720416\" /> Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film.

The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going toward the performances of its cast, particularly by Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film revitalized Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s. In addition to starring in films such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']], and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Brando was a catalyst in this film for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast. At the [[45th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Brando), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (for Puzo and Coppola).

It was followed by sequels ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1945 New York City, at his daughter [[Connie Corleone|Connie]]'s wedding to [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo]], [[Vito Corleone]] listens to requests in his role as [[Don (honorific)|don]] of the [[Corleone crime family]]. His youngest son, [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], who was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] during [[World War II]], introduces his girlfriend, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a [[popular singer]] and Vito's [[Godparent|godson]], seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his [[consigliere]], [[Tom Hagen]], to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized [[Stud (animal)|stallion]].\n\nShortly before Christmas, drug baron [[List of The Godfather series characters#Virgil Sollozzo|Sollozzo]], backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, [[Luca Brasi]], to spy on them. Brasi is [[garrote]]d to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by [[NYPD]] Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a [[The Bronx|Bronx]] restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]], a Corleone [[Caporegime|capo]], he kills both men.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities, the [[Five Families (The Godfather)|Five Families]] erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] is sheltered by [[Moe Greene]] in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding [[submachine gun]]s. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries [[List of The Godfather series characters#Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone|Apollonia]], but a [[car bomb]] intended for him takes her life.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, [[Emilio Barzini|Barzini]], Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\n\nIn 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, [[Salvatore Tessio|Tessio]], a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza immediately garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg|thumb|upright|Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone|alt=A screenshot of Michael and Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather'']]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]]: [[crime boss]] and founder of the [[Corleone family]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]: one of Vito's sons\n* [[James Caan]] as [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]: one of Vito's sons\n* [[Richard Castellano]] as [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]]: a Corleone confidante\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]: Corleone [[consigliere]] and lawyer\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Capt.

Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola, and expresses his  understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to the U.S., the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |title=The Godfather: A Cultural Phenomenon |url=http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007060450/http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |archivedate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> ''The Godfather'' increased Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians in the aftermath of the film and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |first=Megan |last=Gambino |date=January 31, 2012 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |access-date=May 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423232235/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |archive-date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language.
