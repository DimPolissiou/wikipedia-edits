Rape in the English sense was more often expressed as ''stuprum'' committed through violence or coercion (''cum vi'' or ''per vim'').

His [[didactic poetry|didactic poem]] ''De rerum natura'' is a presentation of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] within the [[Ennius|Ennian]] tradition of Latin poetry. Epicureanism is both [[materialism|materialist]] and [[hedonic]]. The [[value (ethics)|highest good]] is pleasure, defined as the absence of physical pain and emotional distress.<ref>[[Epicurus]], ''Letter to Menoeceus'' 131.</ref> The Epicurean seeks to gratify his desires with the least expenditure of passion and effort. Desires are ranked as those that are both natural and necessary, such as hunger and thirst; those that are natural but unnecessary, such as sex; and those that are neither natural nor necessary, including the desire to rule over others and glorify oneself.<ref>A [[scholiast]] gives an example of an unnatural and unnecessary desire as acquiring crowns and setting up statues for oneself; see J.M. Rist, ''Epicurus: An Introduction'' (Cambridge University Press, 1972), pp. 116\u2013119.</ref> It is within this context that Lucretius presents his analysis of love and sexual desire, which counters the erotic ethos of Catullus and influenced the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|love poets of the Augustan period]].<ref>Philip Hardie, \"Lucretius and Later Latin Literature in Antiquity,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius'', p. 121, note 32.</ref>\n\nLucretius treats male desire, female sexual pleasure, heredity, and infertility as aspects of sexual physiology. In the Epicurean view, sexuality arises from impersonal physical causes without divine or supernatural influence. The onset of physical maturity generates semen, and [[wet dreams]] occur as the sexual instinct develops.<ref>Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'', 4.1030\u201357</ref><ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Sense perception, specifically the sight of a beautiful body, provokes the movement of semen into the genitals and toward the object of desire. The engorgement of the genitals creates an urge to ejaculate, coupled with the anticipation of pleasure. The body's response to physical attractiveness is automatic, and neither the character of the person desired nor one's own choice is a factor. With a combination of scientific detachment and ironic humor, Lucretius treats the human sex drive as ''muta cupido'', \"dumb desire\", comparing the physiological response of ejaculation to the blood spurting from a wound.<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 63, 181\u2013182.</ref> Love ''(amor)'' is merely an elaborate cultural posturing that obscures a glandular condition;<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 64.</ref> love taints sexual pleasure just as life is tainted by the fear of death.<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 65. Epicurus taught that the soul was a thin tissue of atoms that dissipated into the cosmos upon death; therefore, there is no afterlife and no reason for mortals to live with anxieties about what happens after death.</ref> Lucretius is writing primarily for a male audience, and assumes that love is a male passion, directed at either boys or women.<ref>Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'' 4.1053\u20131054</ref><ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 123.</ref> Male desire is viewed as pathological, frustrating, and violent.<ref name=\"lucretius65\">[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nLucretius thus expresses an Epicurean ambivalence toward sexuality, which threatens one's peace of mind with agitation if desire becomes a form of bondage and torment,<ref name=\"auto\">[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 67.</ref> but his view of female sexuality is less negative.<ref name=\"lucretius65\"/> While men are driven by unnatural expectations to engage in onesided and desperate sex, women act on a purely animal instinct toward affection, which leads to mutual satisfaction.<ref name=\"lucretius66\">[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 66.</ref> The comparison with female animals in heat is meant not as an insult, though there are a few traces of conventional misogyny in the work, but to indicate that desire is natural and should not be experienced as torture.<ref name=\"lucretius66\"/>\n\nHaving analyzed the sex act, Lucretius then considers conception and what in modern terms would be called genetics.

Some terms, such as ''[[exoletus]]'', specifically refer to an adult; Romans who were socially marked as \"masculine\" did not confine their same-sex penetration of male prostitutes or slaves to those who were \"boys\" under the age of 20.<ref>[[#Williams|Williams]], p. 85.</ref> The ''Satyricon'', for example, includes many descriptions of adult, free men showing sexual interest in one another.

In the early period, Rome had an army of citizens who left their families and took up arms as the need arose. During the [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274 BC\u2013148 BC)|expansionism of the Middle Republic]], Rome began acquiring vast territories to be defended as provinces, and during the time of [[Gaius Marius]] (d. 86&nbsp;BC), the army had been professionalized. The ban on marriage began under [[Augustus]] (ruled 27&nbsp;BC\u201314&nbsp;AD), perhaps to discourage families from following the army and impairing its mobility. The marriage ban applied to all ranks up to the [[centurion]]ate; men of the governing classes were exempt. By the 2nd century AD, the [[Pax Romana|stability of the Empire]] kept most units in permanent forts, where attachments with local women often developed. Although legally these unions could not be formalized as marriages, their value in providing emotional support for the soldiers was recognized. After a soldier was discharged, the couple were granted the right of legal marriage as citizens ''([[Marriage in ancient Rome|conubium]])'', and any children they already had were considered to have been born to citizens.<ref>Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 144.</ref> [[Septimius Severus]] rescinded the ban in 197&nbsp;AD.<ref>[[#Phang2001|Phang (2001)]], p. 2.</ref>\n\nOther forms of sexual gratification available to soldiers were the [[#Master-slave relations|use of male slaves]], [[war rape]], and same-sex relations.<ref>[[#Phang2001|Phang (2001)]], p. 3.

A soldier maintained his masculinity by not allowing his body to be used for sexual purposes. This physical integrity stood in contrast to the limits placed on his actions as a free man within the military hierarchy; most strikingly, Roman soldiers were the only citizens regularly subjected to corporal punishment, reserved in the civilian world mainly for slaves. Sexual integrity helped distinguish the status of the soldier, who otherwise sacrificed a great deal of his civilian autonomy, from that of the slave.<ref>[[#Phang2008|Phang (2008)]], p. 93.

Female citizens were expected to exercise their sexuality within marriage, and were honored for their sexual integrity ''([[pudicitia]])'' and fecundity: [[Augustus]] granted special honors and privileges to women who had given birth to three children (see ''\"[[Ius trium liberorum]]\"'').

The boy, Gaius Publilius, was notably beautiful, and Papirius insisted that as a bond slave he was required to provide sexual services. When Publilius refused, Papirius had him stripped and whipped. The youth then took to the streets to display his injuries, and an outcry among the people led the [[Roman consul|consuls]] to convene the [[Roman Senate|senate]]. The political process eventually led to the ''[[Lex Poetelia Papiria]]'', which prohibited holding debtors in bondage for their debt and required instead that the debtor's property be used as collateral. The law thus established that the integrity of a Roman citizen's body was fundamental to the concept of ''libertas'', political liberty, in contrast to the uses to which a slave's body was subject.<ref group=\"n\">The abolition of debt bondage was facilitated by the spread of [[chattel slavery]] for agricultural labor; thus during the period of Roman conquest and expansionism on the Italian peninsula, the distinction arises between a Roman citizen with rights and an \"Italian\" who might be enslaved; see John W. Rich, \"Tiberius Gracchus, Land and Manpower,\" in ''Crises and the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Nijmegen, June 20\u201324, 2006)'' (Brill, 2007), p. 160.</ref> In this and a similar incident reported by [[Valerius Maximus]], corporal punishment and sexual abuse are seen as similar violations of the citizen's freedom from physical compulsion, in contrast to the slave's physical vulnerability.<ref group=\"n\">In the similar story from Valerius Maximus, a young man named Titus Veturius, whose father was a bankrupt [[Roman magistrate]], had placed himself in slavery with Publius Plotius, who had attempted to seduce him ''([[#Stuprum|stuprare]])''. When Veturius refused, Plotius whipped him. Veturius then complained to the [[Roman consul|consuls]], who took the complaint to the [[Roman senate|senate]]. Plotius was jailed.

The conduct of slaves reflected generally on the respectability of the household, and the ''materfamilias'' in particular was judged by her female slaves' sexual behavior, which was expected to be moral or at least discreet. This decorum may have limited the exploitation of female slaves that were part of the ''familia''.<ref>[[#Harper|Harper]], pp. 294\u2013295.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] expressed Stoic indignation that a male slave should be groomed effeminately and used sexually, because a slave's human dignity should not be debased.<ref>[[#Nussbaum|Nussbaum]], p. 308, citing Seneca, ''Epistula'' 47.</ref> The burgeoning trade in eunuch slaves during the early Empire prompted legislation under the emperor [[Hadrian]] that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will \"for lust or gain\".<ref>Ra'anan Abusch, \"CIrcumcision and Castration under Roman Law in the Early Empire,\" in ''The Covenant of Circumcision: New Perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite'' (Brandeis University Press, 2003), pp. 77\u201378.</ref> Legal agreements on the sale of a slave might include a ''ne serva prostituatur'' [[covenant (law)|covenant]] that prohibited the employment of the slave as a prostitute. Although concern for the slave's welfare may have been a factor in individual cases, this legal restriction seems also to have been intended to shield the male citizen owner from the shame or ''[[#Pleasure and infamy|infamia]]'' associated with pimping and prostitution. The ''ne serva'' covenant remained in force for subsequent sales, even if the buyer was initially unaware of it, and if it was violated, the illegally prostituted slave was granted freedom.<ref>[[#McGinn1998|McGinn (1998)]], p. 288ff., especially p. 297 on [[manumission]]. From a legalistic perspective, the covenant was not subject to negotiation for subsequent sales, because that would implicitly violate it.</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:Pompeii - Lupanar - Erotic Scene - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|Wall painting from the [[Lupanar (Pompeii)|Lupanar (brothel) of Pompeii]] ]]\nProstitution was legal throughout the Roman Empire in all periods.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Most prostitutes were [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves or freedwomen]]. Prostitutes in Rome had to register with the [[aedile]]s. Despite what might seem to be a clear distinction as a matter of law, the jurist [[Ulpian]] opined that an openly [[promiscuous woman]] brought the status of [[prostitute]] upon herself, even if she accepted no money.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett]], p. 76, citing Ulpian, ''Digest'' 23.2.43.3.</ref> The Augustan moral legislation that criminalized adultery exempted prostitutes, who could legally have sex with a married man. Encouraged to think of adultery as a matter of law rather than morality, a few socially prominent women even chose to avoid prosecution for adultery by registering themselves as prostitutes.<ref>[[#Habinek|Habinek]], p. 29.</ref>\n\nConfused status frequently results in plot complications in the [[Roman comedy|comedies]] of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Obstacles to love arise when a young man falls in love with, and wishes to marry, a non-citizen prostitute, and are overcome when the young woman's true status as a freeborn virgin is revealed. The well-brought-up freeborn virgin is marriageable, and the non-citizen prostitute is not.<ref>[[#Langlands|Langlands]], pp. 205\u2013206.</ref> The relation of these comic situations to real life is problematic: Plautus and Terence drew on Greek models which are often little known, and so the extent to which they incorporated Roman social behaviors and attitudes is hard to determine. [[Elaine Fantham]] has observed that prolonged military campaigning in Greece and Asia Minor had introduced Roman men to a more sophisticated standard of luxury and pleasure, perhaps reflected by comedy: the young man acts out his infatuation with an expensive courtesan instead of a family slave or common prostitute.<ref>[[#Fantham|Fantham]], p. 139.</ref>\n\nProstitutes appear in [[erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum]], including wall paintings from buildings identified as brothels, in which they are often nude except for a strapless bra ''(strophium)''. The paintings illustrate various sexual positions that contradict some scholarly claims about the preferences of Roman men in heterosexual acts.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]]</ref> Literary sources record that prostitutes wore distinctive clothing, often gaudy dresses of see-through silk. They were the only Roman women who wore the [[toga]], the distinctive dress of a free Roman male. This crossing of gender boundaries has been interpreted variously.<ref name=\"unspeakable1\">[[#Hallett|Hallett]], p. 81.</ref>\n\n====Pleasure and infamy====\nProstitutes were among those persons in Rome categorized as ''infames'', enjoying few legal protections even if they were technically not slaves.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett]], p. 66.</ref> ''[[Infamia]]'' as a legal status once entered into could not be escaped: a prostitute was \"not only a woman who practices prostitution, but also one who has formerly done so, even though she has ceased to act in this manner; for the disgrace is not removed even if the practice is subsequently discontinued\".<ref>According to the ''[[Lex Iulia et Papia]]'', as cited in ''Women's Life in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook in Translation'', edited by [[Mary R.

The woman who receives cunnilingus is tall and shapely, well-groomed, and brazenly nude except for jewelry. The male figure is relatively small, crouching subserviently, and fully clothed; he has an anxious or furtive look.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 223</ref> The situation is so extreme that it was probably meant to be humorous as well as titillating; other paintings in this group show a series of sex acts, at least some of which could be seen as transgressive or [[parody|parodic]].<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], pp. 224\u2013227.</ref>\n\nThere is some evidence that women could hire male prostitutes to provide cunnilingus. Graffiti at [[Pompeii]] advertise the prices male prostitutes charged for cunnilingus, in the same price range as females performing fellatio; however, the graffiti could be intended as insults to the men named, and not as actual advertisements.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 226.</ref> One graffito is perhaps intended as political invective: \"Vote Isidore for [[aedile]]; he's the best at licking cunt!\"<ref>''CIL'' 4.1383, scrawled at an entrance to a shop in Pompeii; Antonio Varone, ''Erotica Pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii'' (\u00abL'Erma\u00bb di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 81.</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman oil Lamp with erotic motif 05.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Woman fellating a man on an oil lamp]]\nThe Latin verb ''fellare'' is usually used for a woman performing oral sex on a man.<ref name=richlin1981/> Accusing a man of fellating another man was possibly the worst insult in all Roman invective.<ref>[[#Fredrick|Fredrick]], p. 162.</ref> It was an act that might be requested from women who were ''[[#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'',<ref name=richlin1981/><ref>Catullus ''Carmina'' 58 and 59; and Martial, ''Epigrams'' 4.84, 9.4, 9.67, and 12.55, on women who perform fellatio.</ref> and not something a husband in a respectable household would have expected from his wife.<ref name=\"laughing161\">[[#Fredrick|Fredrick]], p. 161.</ref> Fellatio was seen as a \"somewhat laughable\" preference for older men who have trouble maintaining an erection,<ref name=richlin1981/> but graffiti show that the skills of a good ''fellatrix'' were enthusiastically utilized.<ref>[[#Fredrick|Fredrick]], p. 163.</ref> Fellatio was a fairly uncommon subject in Roman art.<ref name=\"laughing161\"/>\n\n====''Irrumatio''====\n{{Main|Irrumatio}}\n''Irrumatio'' is a forced form of fellatio, almost always against another man. Forcing someone to be a receptacle for oral sex was proof of virility, something to boast about, as indicated by the ''[[Priapeia]]'' and the poems of Catullus and Martial. It was also threatened as a punishment,<ref>Mostly famously in [[Catullus 16|Catullus, ''Carmen'' 16]]</ref> particularly for adulterers.<ref name=richlin1981/> Martial urges a wronged husband who has already cut off the adulterous man's ears and nose to complete the humiliation by befouling his mouth with oral rape.<ref>Martial, 2.47.4</ref><ref name=richlin1981/>\n\n===Group sex===\n[[File:Sexual scene on pompeian mural 2.jpg|thumb|[[Threesome]] (from Pompeii) arranged in the manner described by [[Catullus]], poem 56<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], pp. 233\u2013234.</ref>]]\nGroup sex appears in literary sources, graffiti, and art.<ref>Clark, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', pp. 233\u2013234.</ref> [[Suetonius]] says that the emperor [[Tiberius]] enjoyed watching group sex, and described \"chains\" arranged of girls and boys:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn his retreat at Capri, he put together a bedroom that was the theater of his secret debauches. There he assembled from all over companies of male and female prostitutes, and inventors of monstrous couplings (which he called ''spintriae''), so that, intertwining themselves and forming a triple chain ''(triplici serie connexi)'', they mutually prostituted themselves in front of him to fire up his flagging desires.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Tiberius'' 43, as quoted by [[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 234.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Pompeii - Terme Suburbane - Apodyterium - Scene VII.jpg|thumb|125px|Foursome from the Suburban Baths at Pompeii]]\nMost threesomes depict two men penetrating a woman. A medallion from [[Gallo-Roman culture|Roman Gaul]] shows two men reclining on a bed, one on the right and one on the left, with their legs extended under a woman between them. Another shows a woman \"riding\" a man who reclines, while a man standing behind her parts her legs to enter. A far less common variation has one man entering a woman from the rear while he in turn receives anal sex from a man standing behind him, a scenario found in Catullus, ''Carmen'' 56 as well as art. Catullus makes it clear that this concatenation was considered humorous,<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 234.</ref> possibly because the man in the center could be a ''cinaedus'', a male who liked to receive anal sex but who was also considered seductive to women.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], pp. 234\u2013235.</ref>\n\n[[Foursome (group sex)|Foursomes]] also appear in Roman art, typically with two women and two men, sometimes in same-sex pairings.

A woman on the far right kneels beside a bed to perform cunnilingus on a woman lying on it; this woman in turn fellates a man who kneels above her.

The \"abduction\" of an unmarried girl from her father's household in some circumstances was a matter of the couple eloping without her father's permission to marry. Rape in the English sense was more often expressed as ''stuprum'' committed through violence or coercion (''cum vi'' or ''per vim'').

His [[didactic poetry|didactic poem]] ''De rerum natura'' is a presentation of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] within the [[Ennius|Ennian]] tradition of Latin poetry. Epicureanism is both [[materialism|materialist]] and [[hedonic]]. The [[value (ethics)|highest good]] is pleasure, defined as the absence of physical pain and emotional distress.<ref>[[Epicurus]], ''Letter to Menoeceus'' 131.</ref> The Epicurean seeks to gratify his desires with the least expenditure of passion and effort. Desires are ranked as those that are both natural and necessary, such as hunger and thirst; those that are natural but unnecessary, such as sex; and those that are neither natural nor necessary, including the desire to rule over others and glorify oneself.<ref>A [[scholiast]] gives an example of an unnatural and unnecessary desire as acquiring crowns and setting up statues for oneself; see J.M. Rist, ''Epicurus: An Introduction'' (Cambridge University Press, 1972), pp. 116\u2013119.</ref> It is within this context that Lucretius presents his analysis of love and sexual desire, which counters the erotic ethos of Catullus and influenced the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|love poets of the Augustan period]].<ref>Philip Hardie, \"Lucretius and Later Latin Literature in Antiquity,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius'', p. 121, note 32.</ref>\n\nLucretius treats male desire, female sexual pleasure, heredity, and infertility as aspects of sexual physiology. In the Epicurean view, sexuality arises from impersonal physical causes without divine or supernatural influence. The onset of physical maturity generates semen, and [[wet dreams]] occur as the sexual instinct develops.<ref>Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'', 4.1030\u201357</ref><ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Sense perception, specifically the sight of a beautiful body, provokes the movement of semen into the genitals and toward the object of desire. The engorgement of the genitals creates an urge to ejaculate, coupled with the anticipation of pleasure. The body's response to physical attractiveness is automatic, and neither the character of the person desired nor one's own choice is a factor. With a combination of scientific detachment and ironic humor, Lucretius treats the human sex drive as ''muta cupido'', \"dumb desire\", comparing the physiological response of ejaculation to the blood spurting from a wound.<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 63, 181\u2013182.</ref> Love ''(amor)'' is merely an elaborate cultural posturing that obscures a glandular condition;<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 64.</ref> love taints sexual pleasure just as life is tainted by the fear of death.<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 65. Epicurus taught that the soul was a thin tissue of atoms that dissipated into the cosmos upon death; therefore, there is no afterlife and no reason for mortals to live with anxieties about what happens after death.</ref> Lucretius is writing primarily for a male audience, and assumes that love is a male passion, directed at either boys or women.<ref>Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'' 4.1053\u20131054</ref><ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 123.</ref> Male desire is viewed as pathological, frustrating, and violent.<ref name=\"lucretius65\">[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nLucretius thus expresses an Epicurean ambivalence toward sexuality, which threatens one's peace of mind with agitation if desire becomes a form of bondage and torment,<ref name=\"auto\">[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 67.</ref> but his view of female sexuality is less negative.<ref name=\"lucretius65\"/> While men are driven by unnatural expectations to engage in onesided and desperate sex, women act on a purely animal instinct toward affection, which leads to mutual satisfaction.<ref name=\"lucretius66\">[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 66.</ref> The comparison with female animals in heat is meant not as an insult, though there are a few traces of conventional misogyny in the work, but to indicate that desire is natural and should not be experienced as torture.<ref name=\"lucretius66\"/>\n\nHaving analyzed the sex act, Lucretius then considers conception and what in modern terms would be called genetics. Both man and woman, he says, produce genital fluids that mingle in a successful procreative act.

Some terms, such as ''[[exoletus]]'', specifically refer to an adult; Romans who were socially marked as \"masculine\" did not confine their same-sex penetration of male prostitutes or slaves to those who were \"boys\" under the age of 20.<ref>[[#Williams|Williams]], p. 85.</ref> The ''Satyricon'', for example, includes many descriptions of adult, free men showing sexual interest in one another.

In the early period, Rome had an army of citizens who left their families and took up arms as the need arose. During the [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274 BC\u2013148 BC)|expansionism of the Middle Republic]], Rome began acquiring vast territories to be defended as provinces, and during the time of [[Gaius Marius]] (d. 86&nbsp;BC), the army had been professionalized. The ban on marriage began under [[Augustus]] (ruled 27&nbsp;BC\u201314&nbsp;AD), perhaps to discourage families from following the army and impairing its mobility. The marriage ban applied to all ranks up to the [[centurion]]ate; men of the governing classes were exempt. By the 2nd century AD, the [[Pax Romana|stability of the Empire]] kept most units in permanent forts, where attachments with local women often developed. Although legally these unions could not be formalized as marriages, their value in providing emotional support for the soldiers was recognized. After a soldier was discharged, the couple were granted the right of legal marriage as citizens ''([[Marriage in ancient Rome|conubium]])'', and any children they already had were considered to have been born to citizens.<ref>Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 144.</ref> [[Septimius Severus]] rescinded the ban in 197&nbsp;AD.<ref>[[#Phang2001|Phang (2001)]], p. 2.</ref>\n\nOther forms of sexual gratification available to soldiers were the [[#Master-slave relations|use of male slaves]], [[war rape]], and same-sex relations.<ref>[[#Phang2001|Phang (2001)]], p. 3.

A soldier maintained his masculinity by not allowing his body to be used for sexual purposes. This physical integrity stood in contrast to the limits placed on his actions as a free man within the military hierarchy; most strikingly, Roman soldiers were the only citizens regularly subjected to corporal punishment, reserved in the civilian world mainly for slaves. Sexual integrity helped distinguish the status of the soldier, who otherwise sacrificed a great deal of his civilian autonomy, from that of the slave.<ref>[[#Phang2008|Phang (2008)]], p. 93.

Female citizens were expected to exercise their sexuality within marriage, and were honored for their sexual integrity ''([[pudicitia]])'' and fecundity: [[Augustus]] granted special honors and privileges to women who had given birth to three children (see ''\"[[Ius trium liberorum]]\"'').

The boy, Gaius Publilius, was notably beautiful, and Papirius insisted that as a bond slave he was required to provide sexual services. When Publilius refused, Papirius had him stripped and whipped. The youth then took to the streets to display his injuries, and an outcry among the people led the [[Roman consul|consuls]] to convene the [[Roman Senate|senate]]. The political process eventually led to the ''[[Lex Poetelia Papiria]]'', which prohibited holding debtors in bondage for their debt and required instead that the debtor's property be used as collateral. The law thus established that the integrity of a Roman citizen's body was fundamental to the concept of ''libertas'', political liberty, in contrast to the uses to which a slave's body was subject.<ref group=\"n\">The abolition of debt bondage was facilitated by the spread of [[chattel slavery]] for agricultural labor; thus during the period of Roman conquest and expansionism on the Italian peninsula, the distinction arises between a Roman citizen with rights and an \"Italian\" who might be enslaved; see John W. Rich, \"Tiberius Gracchus, Land and Manpower,\" in ''Crises and the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Nijmegen, June 20\u201324, 2006)'' (Brill, 2007), p. 160.</ref> In this and a similar incident reported by [[Valerius Maximus]], corporal punishment and sexual abuse are seen as similar violations of the citizen's freedom from physical compulsion, in contrast to the slave's physical vulnerability.<ref group=\"n\">In the similar story from Valerius Maximus, a young man named Titus Veturius, whose father was a bankrupt [[Roman magistrate]], had placed himself in slavery with Publius Plotius, who had attempted to seduce him ''([[#Stuprum|stuprare]])''. When Veturius refused, Plotius whipped him. Veturius then complained to the [[Roman consul|consuls]], who took the complaint to the [[Roman senate|senate]]. Plotius was jailed.

The conduct of slaves reflected generally on the respectability of the household, and the ''materfamilias'' in particular was judged by her female slaves' sexual behavior, which was expected to be moral or at least discreet. This decorum may have limited the exploitation of female slaves that were part of the ''familia''.<ref>[[#Harper|Harper]], pp. 294\u2013295.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] expressed Stoic indignation that a male slave should be groomed effeminately and used sexually, because a slave's human dignity should not be debased.<ref>[[#Nussbaum|Nussbaum]], p. 308, citing Seneca, ''Epistula'' 47.</ref> The burgeoning trade in eunuch slaves during the early Empire prompted legislation under the emperor [[Hadrian]] that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will \"for lust or gain\".<ref>Ra'anan Abusch, \"CIrcumcision and Castration under Roman Law in the Early Empire,\" in ''The Covenant of Circumcision: New Perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite'' (Brandeis University Press, 2003), pp. 77\u201378.</ref> Legal agreements on the sale of a slave might include a ''ne serva prostituatur'' [[covenant (law)|covenant]] that prohibited the employment of the slave as a prostitute. Although concern for the slave's welfare may have been a factor in individual cases, this legal restriction seems also to have been intended to shield the male citizen owner from the shame or ''[[#Pleasure and infamy|infamia]]'' associated with pimping and prostitution. The ''ne serva'' covenant remained in force for subsequent sales, even if the buyer was initially unaware of it, and if it was violated, the illegally prostituted slave was granted freedom.<ref>[[#McGinn1998|McGinn (1998)]], p. 288ff., especially p. 297 on [[manumission]]. From a legalistic perspective, the covenant was not subject to negotiation for subsequent sales, because that would implicitly violate it.</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:Pompeii - Lupanar - Erotic Scene - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|Wall painting from the [[Lupanar (Pompeii)|Lupanar (brothel) of Pompeii]] ]]\nProstitution was legal throughout the Roman Empire in all periods.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Most prostitutes were [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves or freedwomen]]. Prostitutes in Rome had to register with the [[aedile]]s. Despite what might seem to be a clear distinction as a matter of law, the jurist [[Ulpian]] opined that an openly [[promiscuous woman]] brought the status of [[prostitute]] upon herself, even if she accepted no money.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett]], p. 76, citing Ulpian, ''Digest'' 23.2.43.3.</ref> The Augustan moral legislation that criminalized adultery exempted prostitutes, who could legally have sex with a married man. Encouraged to think of adultery as a matter of law rather than morality, a few socially prominent women even chose to avoid prosecution for adultery by registering themselves as prostitutes.<ref>[[#Habinek|Habinek]], p. 29.</ref>\n\nConfused status frequently results in plot complications in the [[Roman comedy|comedies]] of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Obstacles to love arise when a young man falls in love with, and wishes to marry, a non-citizen prostitute, and are overcome when the young woman's true status as a freeborn virgin is revealed. The well-brought-up freeborn virgin is marriageable, and the non-citizen prostitute is not.<ref>[[#Langlands|Langlands]], pp. 205\u2013206.</ref> The relation of these comic situations to real life is problematic: Plautus and Terence drew on Greek models which are often little known, and so the extent to which they incorporated Roman social behaviors and attitudes is hard to determine. [[Elaine Fantham]] has observed that prolonged military campaigning in Greece and Asia Minor had introduced Roman men to a more sophisticated standard of luxury and pleasure, perhaps reflected by comedy: the young man acts out his infatuation with an expensive courtesan instead of a family slave or common prostitute.<ref>[[#Fantham|Fantham]], p. 139.</ref>\n\nProstitutes appear in [[erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum]], including wall paintings from buildings identified as brothels, in which they are often nude except for a strapless bra ''(strophium)''. The paintings illustrate various sexual positions that contradict some scholarly claims about the preferences of Roman men in heterosexual acts.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]]</ref> Literary sources record that prostitutes wore distinctive clothing, often gaudy dresses of see-through silk. They were the only Roman women who wore the [[toga]], the distinctive dress of a free Roman male. This crossing of gender boundaries has been interpreted variously.<ref name=\"unspeakable1\">[[#Hallett|Hallett]], p. 81.</ref>\n\n====Pleasure and infamy====\nProstitutes were among those persons in Rome categorized as ''infames'', enjoying few legal protections even if they were technically not slaves.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett]], p. 66.</ref> ''[[Infamia]]'' as a legal status once entered into could not be escaped: a prostitute was \"not only a woman who practices prostitution, but also one who has formerly done so, even though she has ceased to act in this manner; for the disgrace is not removed even if the practice is subsequently discontinued\".<ref>According to the ''[[Lex Iulia et Papia]]'', as cited in ''Women's Life in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook in Translation'', edited by [[Mary R.

The woman who receives cunnilingus is tall and shapely, well-groomed, and brazenly nude except for jewelry. The male figure is relatively small, crouching subserviently, and fully clothed; he has an anxious or furtive look.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 223</ref> The situation is so extreme that it was probably meant to be humorous as well as titillating; other paintings in this group show a series of sex acts, at least some of which could be seen as transgressive or [[parody|parodic]].<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], pp. 224\u2013227.</ref>\n\nThere is some evidence that women could hire male prostitutes to provide cunnilingus. Graffiti at [[Pompeii]] advertise the prices male prostitutes charged for cunnilingus, in the same price range as females performing fellatio; however, the graffiti could be intended as insults to the men named, and not as actual advertisements.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 226.</ref> One graffito is perhaps intended as political invective: \"Vote Isidore for [[aedile]]; he's the best at licking cunt!\"<ref>''CIL'' 4.1383, scrawled at an entrance to a shop in Pompeii; Antonio Varone, ''Erotica Pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii'' (\u00abL'Erma\u00bb di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 81.</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman oil Lamp with erotic motif 05.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Woman fellating a man on an oil lamp]]\nThe Latin verb ''fellare'' is usually used for a woman performing oral sex on a man.<ref name=richlin1981/> Accusing a man of fellating another man was possibly the worst insult in all Roman invective.<ref>[[#Fredrick|Fredrick]], p. 162.</ref> It was an act that might be requested from women who were ''[[#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'',<ref name=richlin1981/><ref>Catullus ''Carmina'' 58 and 59; and Martial, ''Epigrams'' 4.84, 9.4, 9.67, and 12.55, on women who perform fellatio.</ref> and not something a husband in a respectable household would have expected from his wife.<ref name=\"laughing161\">[[#Fredrick|Fredrick]], p. 161.</ref> Fellatio was seen as a \"somewhat laughable\" preference for older men who have trouble maintaining an erection,<ref name=richlin1981/> but graffiti show that the skills of a good ''fellatrix'' were enthusiastically utilized.<ref>[[#Fredrick|Fredrick]], p. 163.</ref> Fellatio was a fairly uncommon subject in Roman art.<ref name=\"laughing161\"/>\n\n====''Irrumatio''====\n{{Main|Irrumatio}}\n''Irrumatio'' is a forced form of fellatio, almost always against another man. Forcing someone to be a receptacle for oral sex was proof of virility, something to boast about, as indicated by the ''[[Priapeia]]'' and the poems of Catullus and Martial. It was also threatened as a punishment,<ref>Mostly famously in [[Catullus 16|Catullus, ''Carmen'' 16]]</ref> particularly for adulterers.<ref name=richlin1981/> Martial urges a wronged husband who has already cut off the adulterous man's ears and nose to complete the humiliation by befouling his mouth with oral rape.<ref>Martial, 2.47.4</ref><ref name=richlin1981/>\n\n===Group sex===\n[[File:Sexual scene on pompeian mural 2.jpg|thumb|[[Threesome]] (from Pompeii) arranged in the manner described by [[Catullus]], poem 56<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], pp. 233\u2013234.</ref>]]\nGroup sex appears in literary sources, graffiti, and art.<ref>Clark, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', pp. 233\u2013234.</ref> [[Suetonius]] says that the emperor [[Tiberius]] enjoyed watching group sex, and described \"chains\" arranged of girls and boys:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn his retreat at Capri, he put together a bedroom that was the theater of his secret debauches. There he assembled from all over companies of male and female prostitutes, and inventors of monstrous couplings (which he called ''spintriae''), so that, intertwining themselves and forming a triple chain ''(triplici serie connexi)'', they mutually prostituted themselves in front of him to fire up his flagging desires.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Tiberius'' 43, as quoted by [[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 234.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Pompeii - Terme Suburbane - Apodyterium - Scene VII.jpg|thumb|125px|Foursome from the Suburban Baths at Pompeii]]\nMost threesomes depict two men penetrating a woman. A medallion from [[Gallo-Roman culture|Roman Gaul]] shows two men reclining on a bed, one on the right and one on the left, with their legs extended under a woman between them. Another shows a woman \"riding\" a man who reclines, while a man standing behind her parts her legs to enter. A far less common variation has one man entering a woman from the rear while he in turn receives anal sex from a man standing behind him, a scenario found in Catullus, ''Carmen'' 56 as well as art. Catullus makes it clear that this concatenation was considered humorous,<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], p. 234.</ref> possibly because the man in the center could be a ''cinaedus'', a male who liked to receive anal sex but who was also considered seductive to women.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], pp. 234\u2013235.</ref>\n\n[[Foursome (group sex)|Foursomes]] also appear in Roman art, typically with two women and two men, sometimes in same-sex pairings.

A woman on the far right kneels beside a bed to perform cunnilingus on a woman lying on it; this woman in turn fellates a man who kneels above her.

The Italians withdrew from the war the day before the invasion, but the Allies landed in an area defended by German troops. Planned under the name ''Top Hat'', it was supported by the deception plan [[Operation Boardman]].\n\nThe landings were carried out by the [[US Fifth Army]], under American General [[Mark W. Clark]]. It comprised the [[U.S. VI Corps]], the [[British X Corps]] and the US [[82nd Airborne Division]], a total of about nine [[division (military)|divisions]]. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of [[Naples]] to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping the [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops further south.\n\nIn order to draw troops away from the landing ground, [[Operation Baytown]] was mounted. This was a landing by the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in [[Calabria]] in the 'toe' of Italy, on 3 September. Simultaneous sea landings were made by the British [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] at the port of [[Taranto]] ([[Operation Slapstick]]). British General [[Bernard Montgomery]] had predicted Baytown would be a waste of effort because it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria; if they failed to do so, the diversion would not work. He was proved correct. After Baytown the Eighth Army marched {{convert|300|mi|km}} north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineer obstacles.\n\nThe Salerno landings were carried out without previous naval or aerial bombardment in order to achieve surprise. Surprise was not achieved. As the first wave approached the shore at [[Paestum]] a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English, \"Come on in and give up. We have you covered.\" The troops attacked nonetheless.\n\nThe Germans had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were captured. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Panzer Division]]. It caused heavy casualties, but was beaten off. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a {{convert|10|mi|km}} gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied {{convert|35|\u2013|45|mi|km}} of coastline to a depth of {{convert|6|-|7|mi|km}}.\n\nOver 12\u201314 September the Germans organized a concerted counterattack by six divisions of motorized troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British Eighth Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of  naval and aerial support, although the German attacks reached almost to the beaches in places. Allied fighter pilots slept under the wings of their aircraft,{{where|date=January 2019}} in order to beat a hasty retreat to Sicily in the event German forces broke the beachhead.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Allied strategy ==\n[[File:Invasionofitaly1943.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Invasion of Italy.]]\n\nFollowing the defeat of the [[Axis Powers]] in [[North Africa]], there was disagreement between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as to what the next step should be. [[Winston Churchill]] in particular wanted to invade Italy, which he called the \"underbelly of Europe\" (commonly misquoted as \"soft underbelly\"). Popular support in Italy for the war was declining, and he believed an invasion would remove Italy, and thus the influence of the Italian Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], opening it to Allied traffic. This would make it much easier to supply Allied forces in the [[Middle East]] and [[Far East]], and increase British and American supplies to the [[Soviet Union]]. In addition, it would tie down German forces, keeping them away from the planned [[Battle of Normandy|invasion of Normandy \u2013 Operation Overlord]].\n\nHowever, General [[George Marshall]] and much of the American staff wanted to undertake no operations that might delay the Normandy invasion. When it became clear that Operation Overlord could not be undertaken in 1943, it was agreed forces in North Africa should be used to invade [[Sicily]], with no commitment made to any follow-up operations.\n\nJoint Allied Forces Headquarters [[AFHQ]] were operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean theatre]] and it was they who planned and commanded the invasion of Sicily and the Italian mainland.\n\nThe [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, codenamed Operation Husky, was highly successful, although many of the Axis forces there were allowed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. More importantly a ''[[coup]]'' deposed [[Benito Mussolini]] as head of the Italian government, which then began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten an Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops that would now be trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian (and more so German) resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the fall of Berlin. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden which would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German Commander-in-Chief [[Albert Kesselring|Albrecht von Kesselring]].{{sfn|Grigg|1985|p=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n== The plan ==\n\nThe main landings were scheduled one week later, 9 September 1943. The main force would land around [[Salerno]] on the western coast in ''Operation Avalanche''. It would consist of the [[US Fifth Army]] under General [[Mark W. Clark]], comprising the U.S. VI [[Corps]] under [[Ernest J. Dawley]], the X British Corps under [[Richard McCreery]], and the US 82nd Airborne Division in reserve, a total of about nine divisions. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of [[Naples]] to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping [[Axis Powers|Axis]] troops further south. The inclusion of the 82nd Airborne as a reserve force was possible only with the cancellation of ''Operation Giant II''. The [[British 1st Airborne Division|1st British Airborne]] would be landed by sea near [[Taranto]], on the \"heel\" of Italy in ''[[Operation Slapstick]]'', as a diversion for Salerno. Their task was to capture the port and several nearby airfields and link with the Eighth Army before pressing north to join the Fifth Army near [[Foggia]].\n\nThe plan was deeply flawed. The 5th Army would be landing on a very broad 35-mile front, using only three assault divisions, and the two Corps were widely separated both in distance and by a river. Furthermore, the terrain was highly favorable to the defender. A [[US Army Ranger|Ranger]] force under Colonel [[William O. Darby]] consisting of three US Ranger [[battalion]]s and two British [[Commando]] units was tasked with holding the mountain passes leading to [[Naples]], but no plan existed for linking the Ranger force up with X Corps' follow-up units. Finally, although tactical surprise was unlikely, Clark ordered no naval preparatory bombardment take place, despite experience in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]] demonstrating it was absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Grigg|1985|p=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nApproximately eight German divisions were positioned to cover possible landing sites, including the [[Hermann Goering Division]], 26th and 16th ''[[Panzer]]'', the 15th and 29th ''Panzergrenadier'', and the 1st and 2nd ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]''.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{{Further|Operation Avalanche naval order of battle}}\n{{Further|Allied invasion of Italy order of battle}}\n\n=== Allied ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 120\n | header    = Naval and ground force commanders for Operation ''Avalanche''\n | image1    = H._Kent_Hewitt_Adm_USN.svg\n | caption1  = Vice Adm.

Tactical surprise was not achieved, as the naval commanders had predicted. As the first wave approached the shore at Paestum a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English, \"Come on in and give up. We have you covered.\" The troops attacked nonetheless.\n\nThe Germans had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were successfully taken. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the 16th Panzer division. It caused heavy casualties, but was beaten off with naval gunfire support. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a 10 mile gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied 35\u201345 miles of coast line to a depth of six or seven miles.\n\nDuring September 12\u201314 the Germans organized a concerted counterattack with six divisions of motorised troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British 8th Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of 4000 paratroopers from the 82nd and [[509th Parachute Infantry Battalion|509th PIB]] who air dropped near the hot spots, from strong naval gunfire support, and from well-served Fifth Army artillery. The German attacks reached almost to the beaches but ultimately failed.\n\n[[Mark W. Clark|General Clark]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the second-highest US award for valor in combat, for his front-line leadership during this crisis. He was frequently seen in the most forward positions encouraging the troops. However, in the estimate of historian Carlo D'Este, Clark's poor planning of the operation caused the crisis in the first place..\n\nThe Salerno battle was also the site of a mutiny by about 600 men of the British 10th Corps, who on September 16 refused assignment to new units as replacements. They had previously understood that they would be returning to their own units from which they had been separated during the fighting in the [[North African Campaign]], mainly because they had been wounded. Eventually the Corps commander, McCreery, persuaded most of the men to follow their orders. The [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] who led the mutiny were sentenced to death, but were eventually allowed to rejoin units and the sentence was not carried out.\n\n== The German strategy changes ==\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Winter Line|German prepared defensive lines south of Rome]].]]\n\nThe German 10th Army had come very close to overwhelming the Salerno beachhead. The Allies had been fortunate that at this time [[Adolf Hitler]] had sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel]], and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not a strategic priority. As a result, the Army Group Commander in southern Italy, [[Albert Kesselring|Field Marshall Albert Kesselring]] had been forbidden to call upon reserves from the northern Army Group. The subsequent success of the German 10th Army's defensive campaign in inflicting very heavy casualties on both U.S. 5th and British 8th Armies and Kesselring's strategic arguments that the Allies should be kept as far away from Germany as possible led Hitler to change his mind in October at which point he withdrew Rommel to oversee the build-up of defenses in northern France and gave Kesselring command of the whole of Italy with a remit to keep Rome in German hands for the longest time possible.\n\n== Further Allied advances ==\n\nWith the Salerno beachhead secure, the 5th Army could begin to attack northwest towards Naples. The 8th Army had been making quick progress from the \"toe\" in the face of German engineer delaying actions{{clarify|date=February 2018}} and linked with the 1st Airborne Division on the Adriatic coast. It united the left of its front with the 5th Army's right on 16 September, and advancing up the Adriatic coast captured the airfields near [[Foggia]] on 27 September. Foggia was a major Allied objective because the large airfield complex there would give the Allied air forces the ability to strike new targets in France, Germany and the Balkans. The 5th Army captured [[Naples]] on 1 October, and reached the line of the [[Volturno]] River on October 6. This provided a natural barrier, securing Naples, the Campanian Plain and the vital airfields on it from counterattack. Meanwhile, on the Adriatic coast, the British 8th Army had advanced to a line from [[Campobasso]] to [[Larino]] and [[Termoli]] on the Biferno river.\n\nThus, by early October, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands, and the Allied armies now stood facing the [[Volturno Line]], the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the [[Winter Line]], their strongest defensive line south of Rome. The next stage of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] became for the Allied armies a grinding and attritional slog against skillful, determined and well prepared defenses in terrain and weather conditions which favoured defense and hampered the Allied advantages in mechanised equipment and air superiority. It took until mid-January 1944 to fight through the Volturno, [[Barbara Line|Barbara]] and [[Bernhardt Line|Bernhardt]] lines to reach the '''Gustav Line''', the backbone of the Winter Line defenses, setting the scene for the four [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Battles of Monte Cassino]] which took place between January and May 1944.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Print ===\n* {{cite book\n  | last  = D'Este\n  | first = Carlo\n  | title = Fatal Decision: Anzio and the Battle for Rome\n  | year  = 1991\n  | ISBN  = 0-06-092148-X\n  | ref   = harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last  = Grigg\n  | first = John\n  | title = 1943: The Victory that Never Was\n  | year  = 1985\n  | ISBN  = 0-8217-1596-8\n  | ref   = harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last       = Konstam\n  | first      = Angus\n  | authorlink = Angus Konstam\n  | title      = Salerno 1943: The Allied Invasion of Italy\n  | year       = 2007\n  | publisher  = [[Pen and Sword Books]] \n  | isbn       = 978-1-84415-517-0\n  | ref        = harv }} <small>- Total pages: 192 </small>\n* {{cite book\n  | last       = Konstam\n  | first      = Angus\n  | authorlink = Angus Konstam\n  | title      = Salerno 1943: The Allies invade southern Italy\n  | year       = 2013\n  | publisher  = [[Osprey Publishing]]\n  | isbn       = 978-1-78096-249-8}} <small>- Total pages: 96 </small>\n* {{cite book\n  | last      = Morison\n  | first     = Samuel Eliot\n  | title     = Sicily \u2013 Salerno \u2013 Anzio, January 1943\u2013June 1944\n  | series    = History of United States Naval Operations in World War II\n  | volume    = IX\n  | year      = 1954\n  | publisher = Little, Brown and Co.\n  | location  = Boston\n  | isbn      = 0-7858-1310-1}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last         = Muhm\n  | first        = Gerhard\n  | title        = Linea Gotica avanposto dei Balcani\n  | chapter      = La Tattica tedesca nella Campagna d'Italia\n  | editor-last  = Montemaggi\n  | editor-first = Amedeo\n  | edition      = Civitas\n  | location     = Roma\n  | year         = 1993\n  | language     = it\n  | ref          = harv}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Avalanche, Operation}}\n[[Category:Invasions]]\n[[Category:World War II operations and battles of the Italian Campaign]]\n[[Category:Naval battles and operations of World War II involving the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}\n}}\n{{Infobox Military Conflict\n|conflict=Operation Avalanche\n|partof=the [[Allied invasion of Italy|Invasion of Italy]]\n|image=File:ItalySalernoInvasion1943.jpg\n|caption=Artillery being landed during the invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno, September 1943.\n|date=9-16 September 1943\n|place=[[Salerno]], [[Italy]]\n|result=Allied victory\n|combatant1={{flagcountry|US|1912}}<br />{{flagcountry|UK}}<br />{{flag|Canada|1921}}\n|combatant2={{flagcountry|Nazi Germany}}<br />{{flagcountry|Kingdom of Italy}}\n|commander1={{flagdeco|US|1912}}[[Mark Wayne Clark]]\n|commander2={{flagdeco|Nazi Germany}} [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff|H. von Vietinghoff]]\n|strength1=190,000\n|strength2= \u2264 135,000 <ref> Martin Blumenson, ''United States Army in World War 2, Mediterranean Theater of Operations, Salerno to Cassino'' (1969).

In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden which would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German Commander-in-Chief [[Albert Kesselring|Albrecht von Kesselring]].{{sfn|Grigg|1985|p=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n== The plan ==\n\nThe main landings were scheduled one week later, 9 September 1943. The main force would land around [[Salerno]] on the western coast in ''Operation Avalanche''. It would consist of the [[US Fifth Army]] under General [[Mark W. Clark]], comprising the U.S. VI [[Corps]] under [[Ernest J. Dawley]], the X British Corps under [[Richard McCreery]], and the US 82nd Airborne Division in reserve, a total of about nine divisions. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of [[Naples]] to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping [[Axis Powers|Axis]] troops further south. The inclusion of the 82nd Airborne as a reserve force was possible only with the cancellation of ''Operation Giant II''. The [[British 1st Airborne Division|1st British Airborne]] would be landed by sea near [[Taranto]], on the \"heel\" of Italy in ''[[Operation Slapstick]]'', as a diversion for Salerno. Their task was to capture the port and several nearby airfields and link with the Eighth Army before pressing north to join the Fifth Army near [[Foggia]].\n\nThe plan was deeply flawed. The 5th Army would be landing on a very broad 35-mile front, using only three assault divisions, and the two Corps were widely separated both in distance and by a river. Furthermore, the terrain was highly favorable to the defender. A [[US Army Ranger|Ranger]] force under Colonel [[William O. Darby]] consisting of three US Ranger [[battalion]]s and two British [[Commando]] units was tasked with holding the mountain passes leading to [[Naples]], but no plan existed for linking the Ranger force up with X Corps' follow-up units. Finally, although tactical surprise was unlikely, Clark ordered no naval preparatory bombardment take place, despite experience in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]] demonstrating it was absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Grigg|1985|p=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nApproximately eight German divisions were positioned to cover possible landing sites, including the [[Hermann Goering Division]], 26th and 16th ''[[Panzer]]'', the 15th and 29th ''Panzergrenadier'', and the 1st and 2nd ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]''.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{{Further|Operation Avalanche naval order of battle}}\n{{Further|Allied invasion of Italy order of battle}}\n\n=== Allied ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 120\n | header    = Naval and ground force commanders for Operation ''Avalanche''\n | image1    = H._Kent_Hewitt_Adm_USN.svg\n | caption1  = Vice Adm.

Tactical surprise was not achieved, as the naval commanders had predicted. As the first wave approached the shore at Paestum a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English, \"Come on in and give up. We have you covered.\" The troops attacked nonetheless.\n\nThe Germans had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were successfully taken. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the 16th Panzer division. It caused heavy casualties, but was beaten off with naval gunfire support. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a 10 mile gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied 35\u201345 miles of coast line to a depth of six or seven miles.\n\nDuring September 12\u201314 the Germans organized a concerted counterattack with six divisions of motorised troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British 8th Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of 4000 paratroopers from the 82nd and [[509th Parachute Infantry Battalion|509th PIB]] who air dropped near the hot spots, from strong naval gunfire support, and from well-served Fifth Army artillery. The German attacks reached almost to the beaches but ultimately failed.\n\n[[Mark W. Clark|General Clark]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the second-highest US award for valor in combat, for his front-line leadership during this crisis. He was frequently seen in the most forward positions encouraging the troops. However, in the estimate of historian Carlo D'Este, Clark's poor planning of the operation caused the crisis in the first place..\n\nThe Salerno battle was also the site of a mutiny by about 600 men of the British 10th Corps, who on September 16 refused assignment to new units as replacements. They had previously understood that they would be returning to their own units from which they had been separated during the fighting in the [[North African Campaign]], mainly because they had been wounded. Eventually the Corps commander, McCreery, persuaded most of the men to follow their orders. The [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] who led the mutiny were sentenced to death, but were eventually allowed to rejoin units and the sentence was not carried out.\n\n== The German strategy changes ==\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Winter Line|German prepared defensive lines south of Rome]].]]\n\nThe German 10th Army had come very close to overwhelming the Salerno beachhead. The Allies had been fortunate that at this time [[Adolf Hitler]] had sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel]], and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not a strategic priority. As a result, the Army Group Commander in southern Italy, [[Albert Kesselring|Field Marshall Albert Kesselring]] had been forbidden to call upon reserves from the northern Army Group. The subsequent success of the German 10th Army's defensive campaign in inflicting very heavy casualties on both U.S. 5th and British 8th Armies and Kesselring's strategic arguments that the Allies should be kept as far away from Germany as possible led Hitler to change his mind in October at which point he withdrew Rommel to oversee the build-up of defenses in northern France and gave Kesselring command of the whole of Italy with a remit to keep Rome in German hands for the longest time possible.\n\n== Further Allied advances ==\n\nWith the Salerno beachhead secure, the 5th Army could begin to attack northwest towards Naples. The 8th Army had been making quick progress from the \"toe\" in the face of German engineer delaying actions{{clarify|date=February 2018}} and linked with the 1st Airborne Division on the Adriatic coast. It united the left of its front with the 5th Army's right on 16 September, and advancing up the Adriatic coast captured the airfields near [[Foggia]] on 27 September. Foggia was a major Allied objective because the large airfield complex there would give the Allied air forces the ability to strike new targets in France, Germany and the Balkans. The 5th Army captured [[Naples]] on 1 October, and reached the line of the [[Volturno]] River on October 6. This provided a natural barrier, securing Naples, the Campanian Plain and the vital airfields on it from counterattack. Meanwhile, on the Adriatic coast, the British 8th Army had advanced to a line from [[Campobasso]] to [[Larino]] and [[Termoli]] on the Biferno river.\n\nThus, by early October, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands, and the Allied armies now stood facing the [[Volturno Line]], the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the [[Winter Line]], their strongest defensive line south of Rome. The next stage of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] became for the Allied armies a grinding and attritional slog against skillful, determined and well prepared defenses in terrain and weather conditions which favoured defense and hampered the Allied advantages in mechanised equipment and air superiority. It took until mid-January 1944 to fight through the Volturno, [[Barbara Line|Barbara]] and [[Bernhardt Line|Bernhardt]] lines to reach the '''Gustav Line''', the backbone of the Winter Line defenses, setting the scene for the four [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Battles of Monte Cassino]] which took place between January and May 1944.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Print ===\n* {{cite book\n  | last  = D'Este\n  | first = Carlo\n  | title = Fatal Decision: Anzio and the Battle for Rome\n  | year  = 1991\n  | ISBN  = 0-06-092148-X\n  | ref   = harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last  = Grigg\n  | first = John\n  | title = 1943: The Victory that Never Was\n  | year  = 1985\n  | ISBN  = 0-8217-1596-8\n  | ref   = harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last       = Konstam\n  | first      = Angus\n  | authorlink = Angus Konstam\n  | title      = Salerno 1943: The Allied Invasion of Italy\n  | year       = 2007\n  | publisher  = [[Pen and Sword Books]] \n  | isbn       = 978-1-84415-517-0\n  | ref        = harv }} <small>- Total pages: 192 </small>\n* {{cite book\n  | last       = Konstam\n  | first      = Angus\n  | authorlink = Angus Konstam\n  | title      = Salerno 1943: The Allies invade southern Italy\n  | year       = 2013\n  | publisher  = [[Osprey Publishing]]\n  | isbn       = 978-1-78096-249-8}} <small>- Total pages: 96 </small>\n* {{cite book\n  | last      = Morison\n  | first     = Samuel Eliot\n  | title     = Sicily \u2013 Salerno \u2013 Anzio, January 1943\u2013June 1944\n  | series    = History of United States Naval Operations in World War II\n  | volume    = IX\n  | year      = 1954\n  | publisher = Little, Brown and Co.\n  | location  = Boston\n  | isbn      = 0-7858-1310-1}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last         = Muhm\n  | first        = Gerhard\n  | title        = Linea Gotica avanposto dei Balcani\n  | chapter      = La Tattica tedesca nella Campagna d'Italia\n  | editor-last  = Montemaggi\n  | editor-first = Amedeo\n  | edition      = Civitas\n  | location     = Roma\n  | year         = 1993\n  | language     = it\n  | ref          = harv}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Avalanche, Operation}}\n[[Category:Invasions]]\n[[Category:World War II operations and battles of the Italian Campaign]]\n[[Category:Naval battles and operations of World War II involving the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Havsj\u00f6", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Avalanche"}

It rises to {{convert|3152|meters|ft|0}} above the sea level, where there is a church (built in the 17th century) with a shrine, devoted to ''El Se\u00f1or Ca\u00eddo'' (\"The Fallen Lord\").\n\nThe Mountain, already considered sacred in pre-Columbian times when the area was inhabited by the indigenous [[Muisca people|Muisca]], is a pilgrim destination, as well as a major tourist attraction. In addition to the church, the summit contains restaurants, cafeteria, souvenir shops and many smaller tourist facilities. Monserrate can be accessed by [[aerial tramway]] (a cable car known as the telef\u00e9rico), by [[funicular]], or by climbing, the preferred way of pilgrims. The climbing route was previously closed due to wildfires and landslides caused by a drought, but it reopened in 2017.\n\nAll downtown Bogot\u00e1, south Bogot\u00e1 and some sections of the north of the city are visible facing west, making it a popular destination to watch the sunset over the city.

Before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]], the [[Bogot\u00e1 savanna]] was inhabited by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who were organised in their loose [[Muisca Confederation]]. The indigenous people, who had a thorough understanding of [[Muisca astronomy|astronomy]], called Monserrate ''quijicha caca''; \"grandmother's foot\".<ref name=Bonilla2017_p153>Bonilla Romero et al., 2017, p.153</ref> At the solstice of June, the Sun, represented in their [[Muisca religion|religion]] by the solar god [[Su\u00e9]], rises exactly from behind Monserrate, as seen from [[Bol\u00edvar Square]].<ref name=Bonilla2011_p14>Bonilla Romero, 2011, p.14</ref> The Spanish [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] in the early colonial period replaced the Muisca temples by catholic buildings.

As time passed, many devoted residents of Bogot\u00e1 began participating in the climb to the hill top. In 1650, four gentlemen met with the Archbishop as well as Juan de Borja, the head of the Tribunal of Santafe de Bogot\u00e1, in order to secure permission to build a small religious retreat on the top of Monserrate. The founders decided to establish the hermitage retreat in the name of Monserrat's Morena Virgin. Her sanctuary was located in [[Catalonia]], near [[Barcelona]], giving the mountain the name Monserrate. Some people believe Montserrat was chosen to be the patron saint, due to one of the founders, Pedro Solis, having an uncle who had previously served as abbot in the Montserrat sanctuary.\n\nBy 1656, Father Rojas had been assigned guarding the sanctuary and ordered the carving of a crucifix and a statue of Jesus Christ. After this statue was taken off the cross, it earned the name ''El Se\u00f1or Ca\u00eddo'' (\"The Fallen Lord\"). Originally, these sculptures were placed inside a small chapel dedicated to the adoration of Christ instead of being placed inside the religious retreat itself. As time passed, more and more people began visiting the sanctuary in order to see the statue of Jesus, rather than the matron saint of Monserrat. By the 19th century, the statue of \"The Fallen Lord\" had gained so much attention, that the sculpture to the Virgin of Montserrat was removed from the hill as the center piece of the sanctuary and replaced with \"El Se\u00f1or Caido\". The mountain has retained the name Monserrate afterwards. Ever since then, for more than four centuries, pilgrims and citizens have hiked the mountain to offer their prayers to the shrine of \"El Se\u00f1or Caido\".\n\n== Tourism ==\nBoth Monserrate and its neighbor [[Guadalupe Hill]] are icons of Bogota's cityscape.

It rises to {{convert|3152|m|ft|0}} above the sea level, where there is a church (built in the 17th century) with a shrine, devoted to ''El Se\u00f1or Ca\u00eddo'' (\"The Fallen Lord\").\n\nThe Mountain, already considered sacred in pre-Columbian times when the area was inhabited by the indigenous [[Muisca people|Muisca]], is a pilgrim destination, as well as a major tourist attraction. In addition to the church, the summit contains restaurants, cafeteria, souvenir shops and many smaller tourist facilities. Monserrate can be accessed by [[aerial tramway]] (a cable car known as the telef\u00e9rico), by [[funicular]], or by climbing, the preferred way of pilgrims. The climbing route was previously closed due to wildfires and landslides caused by a drought, but it reopened in 2017.\n\nAll downtown Bogot\u00e1, south Bogot\u00e1 and some sections of the north of the city are visible facing west, making it a popular destination to watch the sunset over the city. Every year, Monserrate and its neighbour [[Guadalupe Hill|Guadalupe]] attract many tourists.\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\n{{see also|Eastern Hills, Bogot\u00e1#History|Muisca Confederation#Bacat\u00e1}}\nThe history of Monserrate goes back to the [[pre-Columbian era]]. Before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]], the [[Bogot\u00e1 savanna]] was inhabited by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who were organised in their loose [[Muisca Confederation]]. The indigenous people, who had a thorough understanding of [[Muisca astronomy|astronomy]], called Monserrate ''quijicha caca''; \"grandmother's foot\".<ref name=Bonilla2017_p153>Bonilla Romero et al., 2017, p.153</ref> At the solstice of June, the Sun, represented in their [[Muisca religion|religion]] by the solar god [[Su\u00e9]], rises exactly from behind Monserrate, as seen from [[Bol\u00edvar Square]].<ref name=Bonilla2011_p14>Bonilla Romero, 2011, p.14</ref> The Spanish [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] in the early colonial period replaced the Muisca temples by catholic buildings.

As time passed, many devoted residents of Bogot\u00e1 began participating in the climb to the hill top. In 1650, four gentlemen met with the Archbishop as well as Juan de Borja, the head of the Tribunal of Santafe de Bogot\u00e1, in order to secure permission to build a small religious retreat on the top of Monserrate. The founders decided to establish the hermitage retreat in the name of Monserrat's Morena Virgin. Her sanctuary was located in [[Catalonia]], near [[Barcelona]], giving the mountain the name Monserrate. Some people believe Montserrat was chosen to be the patron saint, due to one of the founders, Pedro Solis, having an uncle who had previously served as abbot in the Montserrat sanctuary.\n\nBy 1656, Father Rojas had been assigned guarding the sanctuary and ordered the carving of a crucifix and a statue of Jesus Christ. After this statue was taken off the cross, it earned the name ''El Se\u00f1or Ca\u00eddo'' (\"The Fallen Lord\"). Originally, these sculptures were placed inside a small chapel dedicated to the adoration of Christ instead of being placed inside the religious retreat itself. As time passed, more and more people began visiting the sanctuary in order to see the statue of Jesus, rather than the matron saint of Monserrat. By the 19th century, the statue of \"The Fallen Lord\" had gained so much attention, that the sculpture to the Virgin of Montserrat was removed from the hill as the center piece of the sanctuary and replaced with \"El Se\u00f1or Caido\". The mountain has retained the name Monserrate afterwards. Ever since then, for more than four centuries, pilgrims and citizens have hiked the mountain to offer their prayers to the shrine of \"El Se\u00f1or Caido\".\n\n== Tourism ==\nBoth Monserrate and its neighbor [[Guadalupe Hill]] are icons of Bogota's cityscape.

In many ways, ecological urbanism is an evolution of, and a critique of, [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] arguing for a more holistic approach to the design and management of cities.

Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]], its general secretary, and the other members of the [[FIFA Council]] in the year following the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=\"FIFA-congress\">{{cite news |date=27 May 2011 |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405100855/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |title=FIFA Congress |publisher=FIFA}}</ref>\n\nFIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of congress.

The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.\n\nThe president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. [[Gianni Infantino]] is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president [[Sepp Blatter]] was suspended pending a [[2015 FIFA corruption case|corruption investigation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/08/iss-hayatou-acting-president-fifa-sepp-blatter-suspended |title=Issa Hayatou to be acting Fifa president following suspension of Sepp Blatter |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 October 2015 |website=The Guardian|access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/acting-president/index.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nFIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]]. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.\n\n=== Video replay and goal-line technology ===\n{{See also|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}\nFIFA now permits the use video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a [[mafia]] family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear.

Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]], its general secretary, and the other members of the [[FIFA Council]] in the year following the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=\"FIFA-congress\">{{cite news |date=27 May 2011 |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405100855/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |title=FIFA Congress |publisher=FIFA}}</ref>\n\nFIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of congress. The council is composed of 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.\n\nThe president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. [[Gianni Infantino]] is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president [[Sepp Blatter]] was suspended pending a [[2015 FIFA corruption case|corruption investigation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/08/iss-hayatou-acting-president-fifa-sepp-blatter-suspended |title=Issa Hayatou to be acting Fifa president following suspension of Sepp Blatter |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 October 2015 |website=The Guardian|access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/acting-president/index.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nFIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]]. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.\n\n=== Video replay and goal-line technology ===\n{{See also|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}\nFIFA now permits the use video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million.

The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected.
