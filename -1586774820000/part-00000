The queue also includes multiple posters for fake advertisements for attractions in the Kingdom of Duloc. Guests then enter a dungeon in Duloc where the storyline for the attraction will be revealed.<ref name=\"USH Video\">{{cite web|title=Universal Studios Hollywood \u2013 Shrek|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5TrJ1J8RTs|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=PARANOjAnO}}</ref>\n\nAt Warner Bros. Movie World, the queue began outside the ''[[Roxy Theatre (Warner Bros. Movie World)|Roxy Theatre]]'' and wrapped around the left-hand side of the building into the alleyway. Guests were ushered into the pre-show room where they were given a pair of 3D glasses.<ref name=\"WBMW Video\">{{cite web|title=Shrek4D|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IleLvl9zRO4|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=MrMyOmy}}</ref> A similar set-up occurred at Movie Park Germany.\n\n===Pre-show===\nParticipants are given their \"OgreVision\" 3-D Goggles as they enter a [[dungeon]]-like room with two giant television screens on either side. While loading the pre-show room attraction presenters commonly make jokes to encourage people to move closer to each other in order to fit the capacity audience in the room. The pre-show begins with the [[Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|Three Little Pigs]], [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingy]], and [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]] revealing that [[Lord Farquaad]] has kidnapped them and is holding them in Castle Duloc's dungeon. Gingy flees in the middle of the explanation. The Magic Mirror begins to summarize [[Shrek|the story of what happened before]] (i.e. the first Shrek film) by stating \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\" as a spoof on ''[[Star Wars]]''. When he is chastised, he quickly responds, \"Sorry...I've been feeling really spaced out lately...\". After the Mirror finishes, Farquaad appears and states that he intends to torture the fairytale creatures as well as the audience in order to find Shrek and Fiona. The monitor screen later shows a [[test card]] with Lord Farquaad in the center. The Mirror then warns the audience about safety. In the Hollywood version, Donkey appeared in audio animatronic form and interacted with the guests. With the addition of Donkey, the pre show was shorter in which it did not feature the recap of the story. Everything else was the same. In the Japan version, the Mirror tells the audience to put on their goggles. The cinema doors are then opened and guests take their seats in the theatre.<ref name=\"Pre-show video\">{{cite web|title=  shrek 4 d preshow universal studios florida |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bKrvwN1tFM|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=sfgamfreek}}</ref>\n\n===Main show===\nThe [[short film]] takes place right after the first Shrek film. It opens with the spirit of Lord Farquaad returning from the dead to kidnap [[Princess Fiona]]. Therefore, it is up to [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] to rescue her. Upon Shrek and Donkey searching around the local graveyard, Farquaad sends a stone statue of Dragon from his tomb to go after them and kill them. Fortunately, the real Dragon arrives to the rescue, leading to a chase scene (featuring the sound of a [[TIE fighter]]'s blaster from ''Star Wars'' when Dragon shoots a fireball to create a tunnel in a cliff face), ending with the stone dragon losing its wings against the walls of a hole and falling into the water below. Lord Farquaad sends Fiona on a raft to fall over the waterfall (with Thelonious still on it, not realizing he was supposed to get off). Fiona manages to break the restraints and knees Thelonious in the groin, causing him to fall off the raft. Shrek and Donkey arrive shortly after to rescue her before the raft plunges over the waterfall, but in the end, all four of them fall over the waterfall, only to be saved by Dragon, who then (under Donkey's orders) breathes fire at Farquaad, destroying him again.\n\nAlthough the animation is [[3D film|3D]], the ride is a [[4D film]], which incorporates physical effects including motion seats which tilt forward, backward, vibrate, and raise up and drop down during the show. Water sprayers are attached to the back of each seat, to spray the face of the rider sitting behind it. Water sprayers on the ceiling spray riders seated on the front row.

The attraction consists of guests walking up to an animatronic [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] who mingles with them and makes fun of them. The guests have their picture taken with Donkey, and then move onto meeting [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Princess Fiona]], the latter of which talks to them. Guests then have their picture taken with Shrek and Fiona. These photos can then be purchased. The attraction temporarily closed in June 2012 to make way for ''[[Transformers: The Ride 3D]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Other Attractions {{!}} Donkey's Photo Finish \u2013 Closed For the New Transformers 3D Ride|url=http://www.totalorlando.com/parkshowsandexhibits-12-235-Donkeys_Photo_Finish__Closed_For_the_New_Transformers_3D_Ride.html|publisher=Total Orlando|accessdate=December 23, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028075710/http://www.totalorlando.com/parkshowsandexhibits-12-235-Donkeys_Photo_Finish__Closed_For_the_New_Transformers_3D_Ride.html|archivedate=October 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> before reopening in a new location next to Monsters Cafe.

Movie World, the queue began outside the ''[[Roxy Theatre (Warner Bros. Movie World)|Roxy Theatre]]'' and wrapped around the left-hand side of the building into the alleyway. Guests were ushered into the pre-show room where they were given a pair of 3D glasses.<ref name=\"WBMW Video\">{{cite web|title=Shrek4D|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IleLvl9zRO4|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=MrMyOmy}}</ref> A similar set-up occurred at Movie Park Germany.\n\n===Pre-show===\nParticipants are given their \"OgreVision\" 3-D Goggles as they enter a [[dungeon]]-like room with two giant television screens on either side. While loading the pre-show room attraction presenters commonly make jokes to encourage people to move closer to each other in order to fit the capacity audience in the room. The pre-show begins with the [[Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|Three Little Pigs]], [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingy]], and [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]] revealing that [[Lord Farquaad]] has kidnapped them and is holding them in Castle Duloc's dungeon. Gingy flees in the middle of the explanation. The Magic Mirror begins to summarize [[Shrek|the story of what happened before]] (i.e. the first Shrek film) by stating \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\" as a spoof on ''[[Star Wars]]''. When he is chastised, he quickly responds, \"Sorry...I've been feeling really spaced out lately...\". After the Mirror finishes, Farquaad appears and states that he intends to torture the fairytale creatures as well as the audience in order to find Shrek and Fiona. The monitor screen later shows a [[test card]] with Lord Farquaad in the center. The Mirror then warns the audience about safety. In the Hollywood version, Donkey appeared in audio animatronic form and interacted with the guests. With the addition of Donkey, the pre show was shorter in which it did not feature the recap of the story. Everything else was the same. In the Japan version, the Mirror tells the audience to put on their goggles. The cinema doors are then opened and guests take their seats in the theatre.<ref name=\"Pre-show video\">{{cite web|title=  shrek 4 d preshow universal studios florida |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bKrvwN1tFM|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=sfgamfreek}}</ref>\n\n===Main show===\nThe [[short film]] takes place right after the first Shrek film. It opens with the spirit of Lord Farquaad returning from the dead to kidnap [[Princess Fiona]]. Therefore, it is up to [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] to rescue her. Upon Shrek and Donkey searching around the local graveyard, Farquaad sends a stone statue of Dragon from his tomb to go after them and kill them. Fortunately, the real Dragon arrives to the rescue, leading to a chase scene (featuring the sound of a [[TIE fighter]]'s blaster from ''Star Wars'' when Dragon shoots a fireball to create a tunnel in a cliff face), ending with the stone dragon losing its wings against the walls of a hole and falling into the water below. Lord Farquaad sends Fiona on a raft to fall over the waterfall (with Thelonious still on it, not realizing he was supposed to get off). Fiona manages to break the restraints and knees Thelonious in the groin, causing him to fall off the raft. Shrek and Donkey arrive shortly after to rescue her before the raft plunges over the waterfall, but in the end, all four of them fall over the waterfall, only to be saved by Dragon, who then (under Donkey's orders) breathes fire at Farquaad, destroying him again.\n\nAlthough the animation is [[3D film|3D]], the ride is a [[4D film]], which incorporates physical effects including motion seats which tilt forward, backward, vibrate, and raise up and drop down during the show. Water sprayers are attached to the back of each seat, to spray the face of the rider sitting behind it. Water sprayers on the ceiling spray riders seated on the front row. Multiple lighting effects are used, such as projected images of a moving waterfall on the walls, or \"magical\" sparkles of flickering light. Air blasters on the front of every seat blow air against riders neck and head. Leg ticklers are also used to simulate spiders crawling across the theater.<ref name=\"4D Motion Seats\">{{cite web|title=4D Motion Seats|url=http://fxillusions.com.au/images/4d-motion-seats/index.html|work=Photo Gallery|publisher=FX Illusions|accessdate=August 3, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218022714/http://www.fxillusions.com.au/images/4d-motion-seats/index.html|archivedate=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Live Film 2\">{{cite web|title= Shrek 4 D at Universal part 1/2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zB2o2cwNzc|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=ecodev1}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title= Shrek 4 D at Universal part 2/2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UT8K03SXII|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 3, 2010|author=ecodev1}}</ref> Stationary seats, which do not move during the film, are marked and available for those who want to watch the film without the motion or vibration.

The attraction consists of guests walking up to an animatronic [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] who mingles with them and makes fun of them. The guests have their picture taken with Donkey, and then move onto meeting [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Princess Fiona]], the latter of which talks to them. Guests then have their picture taken with Shrek and Fiona. These photos can then be purchased. The attraction temporarily closed in June 2012 to make way for ''[[Transformers: The Ride 3D]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Other Attractions {{!}} Donkey's Photo Finish \u2013 Closed For the New Transformers 3D Ride|url=http://www.totalorlando.com/parkshowsandexhibits-12-235-Donkeys_Photo_Finish__Closed_For_the_New_Transformers_3D_Ride.html|publisher=Total Orlando|accessdate=December 23, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028075710/http://www.totalorlando.com/parkshowsandexhibits-12-235-Donkeys_Photo_Finish__Closed_For_the_New_Transformers_3D_Ride.html|archivedate=October 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> before reopening in a new location next to Monsters Cafe.

The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[ Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nDuring the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure (color)|azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].\n\n== Origin ==\nTwo accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H.

According to one source, the ship's Dutch lead engineer Butler faced the need for the flag, and issued a request to the [[Duma#In early Russian history|Boyar Duma]], to \"ask His Royal Majesty as to which (as is the custom among other nations) flag shall be raised on the ship\". The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler's) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&pg=PA21&dq=european+flag&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=hek3U5mTDcu7ygOF54D4Dg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dutch&f=false Flag T.H.

The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.\n\nThe flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].\n\n===Flags of the Russian SFSR===\n{{See also|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918\u20131937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 \u2013 21 January 1937)]]\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954\u201391)]]\n\nOn 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.\n\nOn 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.\n\nOn 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.\n\nContrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420.&nbsp;\u2014 1925, \u2116&nbsp;20, \u0446\u0438\u0442. \u043f\u043e: \u0412\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, \u0422.1/\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0412. \u0410.&nbsp;\u2014 \u041c.: \u041c\u0413\u0418\u0423, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, \u0421\u0421.487\u2013488</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

It was never made the official state flag.\n\nWhen the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].\n\nThe tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.\n\nIt, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|\u0428\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]].

The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[ Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nDuring the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].\n\n== Origin ==\nTwo accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H.

The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.\n\nThe flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].\n\n===Flags of the Russian SFSR===\n{{See also|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918\u20131937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 \u2013 21 January 1937)]]\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954\u201391)]]\n\nOn 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.\n\nOn 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.\n\nOn 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.\n\nContrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420.&nbsp;\u2014 1925, \u2116&nbsp;20, \u0446\u0438\u0442. \u043f\u043e: \u0412\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, \u0422.1/\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0412. \u0410.&nbsp;\u2014 \u041c.: \u041c\u0413\u0418\u0423, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, \u0421\u0421.487\u2013488</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

It was never made the official state flag.\n\nWhen the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].\n\nThe tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.\n\nIt, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|\u0428\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]].
