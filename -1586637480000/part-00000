This word is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] words \"r\u00fam\" (\"wide\" or \"broad\") and \"cofa\" (\"cave\" or \"cove\"). Other historical spellings of Runcorn include \"Rumcoven\", \"Ronchestorn\", \"Runckhorne\", and \"Runcorne\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|p=5.}} and {{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=4.}}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about the early history of the settlement but isolated findings of objects from the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron Age]]s have been made and there is evidence of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] presence in the area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=1\u20134.}}</ref>\n\nThe first recorded event in its history is the building by [[Ethelfleda]] of a fortification at Runcorn to protect the northern frontier of her kingdom of [[Mercia]] against the [[Viking]]s in 915. The fort was built on Castle Rock overlooking the River Mersey at Runcorn Gap.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|pp=6\u201313.}} The foundations of the fort were discovered during the building of the railway bridge but were covered by an abutment of the bridge.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest]], Runcorn was not mentioned in the 1086 [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey, although surrounding settlements were. [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] granted the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]] to [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] who granted the [[Barons of Halton|barony of Halton]] to Nigel. It is likely that Nigel erected a [[motte and bailey]] castle on Halton Hill in the 1070s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=7\u20138.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at [[Runcorn Priory|Runcorn]]. In 1134 the priory was moved to Norton, about {{convert|3.5|mi|km|0}} away. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of [[abbey]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=1\u20139.}}</ref> In 1536 the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|monastery was dissolved]], and around nine years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir [[Richard Brooke (Norton)|Richard Brooke]] who converted the habitable part of the abbey into a house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=151.}} and {{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|p=39.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, [[Rocksavage]], an Elizabethan Hall, was constructed for Sir John Savage in Clifton, now part of Runcorn.<ref name=ioe>{{NHLE |num= 1330365 |desc= Remains of Rock Savage|accessdate= 4 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}</ref>\n\n===English Civil War===\nDuring the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], [[Halton Castle]] was held for the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] by John Savage, 2nd [[Earl Rivers]], the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian [[Roundheads]].\n\nThe first siege was led by [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1643; the second was during the following year. Following this, a \"Council of War\" was held in Warrington in 1646 at which it was decided that the castle should be [[Slighting|slighted]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=57\u201358.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1656, Runcorn was described as being \"nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements\".<ref>King, Daniel, ''The Vale Royal of England'', 1656 (quoted in {{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=73.}}).</ref> And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet. The only through traffic used the ferry which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.\n\n===Industrialisation===\n[[File:Halton Castle engraving.jpg|thumb|270 px|[[Halton Castle]] in the 18th century]]\nDuring the 18th century, water transport had been improved in the area by the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]]. This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the canal system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the [[Port of Runcorn]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|pp=19\u201324.}} and {{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=125\u2013130.}}</ref>\n\nLater came the [[Runcorn to Latchford Canal]] linking with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, and the Weston Canal which gave better access to the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation]] system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=173.}}</ref>\n\nIndustries began to develop within and around the town, in particular shipbuilding, engineering, chemical manufacturing, tanning, and [[sandstone]] quarrying. Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early years of the 19th century, the town was a health resort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=133\u2013137.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Paul's (drawing).jpg|thumb|St Paul's Methodist Chapel, since demolished]]\nThe growth of industry by the early 19th century had not diminished Runcorn's reputation as a health resort and in 1822 the town's first Saltwater Baths opened. This was followed by new visitor accommodation in 1831 at Belvedere Terrace \"for the reception of visitors in search of health and pleasure\".<ref name=\"New Town Masterplan\" />\n\nIn the middle of the century, the growing wealth of the town and its industrialists saw the construction of several new landmarks, including [[Runcorn Town Hall|Halton Grange]], St Paul's Methodist Chapel and [[All Saints' Church, Runcorn|All Saints' Church]].<ref name=\"vardy\">{{cite journal | quotes = | last =Vardy | first = Peter I.| authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year = 2006 | month = | title =Thomas Hazlehurst and his family: Methodism and the Early Chemical Industry in Runcorn in the Nineteenth Century | journal =Cheshire History | volume = 45| issue = | pages =67\u201382 | issn = 0141-8696 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nFor hundreds of years, the only means of crossing the River Mersey had been by the Runcorn ferry. [[Thomas Telford]] proposed a {{convert|1000|ft|m}} single span suspension bridge as early as 1817, but it was not until 1868 that the first bridge, [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]], was opened across the Mersey at Runcorn. This gave the town direct rail links with [[Liverpool]] and the rest of the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|p=206.}}</ref>\n\nRuncorn was becoming an industrialised and highly polluted town. During the later 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries. In the 1880s a pipeline was opened between [[Northwich]] and Weston Point, supplying brine to the salt works and in 1896 the Castner Kellner chemical works was established.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=160\u2013162.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was opened throughout its length.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=184.}}</ref> This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], some of them calling at the port of Runcorn. The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number of people involved in constructing the ship canal.\n\nIn 1905, the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=17.}}</ref> This would not be replaced until 1961 with the construction of Runcorn Road Bridge (since renamed the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]]) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th&nbsp;century, the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning. This growth was largely due to government fixed-priced cost contracts for tanned hides. In 1926, four chemical companies merged to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the tanneries closed (the last to close was the Highfield Tannery in the late 1960s) and the chemical industry declined. At the same time, light industry developed together with warehouses and distribution centres.<ref name=\"ep\">{{citation |url=http://www.ebusinessdirectories.co.uk/BusinessDirectories/Pages/HaltonBD2006/alive.html |title=Halton Business Directory |accessdate=1 September 2007 |publisher=Halton Borough Council |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070822004655/http://www.ebusinessdirectories.co.uk/BusinessDirectories/Pages/HaltonBD2006/alive.html |archivedate = 22 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000; height:17px;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1901\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1911\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1921\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1931\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1941\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1951\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1961\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| Population\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 16,491\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 17,353\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 18,476\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 18,127\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 21,718\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 23,931\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 26,035\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"14\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"|''Source:<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10062263&c_id=10001043&add=N |title=Runcorn UD: Total Population |accessdate=16 October 2012 |publisher=A Vision of Britain through Time}}</ref>''\n|}\n\n===New Town designation===\n[[File:Southgate Estate, Runcorn, August 1989, 2.jpg|thumb|The ill-fated [[Southgate Estate]] in Runcorn New Town]]\nRuncorn was designated a new town in 1964 primarily to meet Liverpool's need for more housing land.<ref name=\"Tale of Two Centres\">{{cite journal| last = Couch| first = Chris| last2 = Fowles| first2 = Steven| date = 2006| title = Britain: Runcorn \u2014 A Tale of Two Centres| jstor = 23289488| journal = Built Environment| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 88\u2013102}}</ref> The new town masterplan published in 1966 more than doubled the population as it swallowed neighbouring settlements to the south and east, including [[Halton, Runcorn|Halton Village]], [[Weston, Runcorn|Weston]], Clifton and [[Norton, Runcorn|Norton]], and new housing developments were created on greenfield land at Halton Lodge, Halton Brook, Palace Fields, The Brow, Castlefields, Murdishaw, Beechwood, Brookvale and Windmill Hill.

The fort was built on Castle Rock overlooking the River Mersey at Runcorn Gap.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|pp=6\u201313.}} The foundations of the fort were discovered during the building of the railway bridge but were covered by an abutment of the bridge.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest]], Runcorn was not mentioned in the 1086 [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey, although surrounding settlements were. [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] granted the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]] to [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] who granted the [[Barons of Halton|barony of Halton]] to Nigel. It is likely that Nigel erected a [[motte and bailey]] castle on Halton Hill in the 1070s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=7\u20138.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at [[Runcorn Priory|Runcorn]]. In 1134 the priory was moved to Norton, about {{convert|3.5|mi|km|0}} away. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of [[abbey]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=1\u20139.}}</ref> In 1536 the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|monastery was dissolved]], and around nine years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir [[Richard Brooke (Norton)|Richard Brooke]] who converted the habitable part of the abbey into a house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=151.}} and {{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|p=39.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, [[Rocksavage]], an Elizabethan Hall, was constructed for Sir John Savage in Clifton, now part of Runcorn.<ref name=ioe>{{NHLE |num= 1330365 |desc= Remains of Rock Savage|accessdate= 4 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}</ref>\n\n===English Civil War===\nDuring the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], [[Halton Castle]] was held for the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] by John Savage, 2nd [[Earl Rivers]], the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian [[Roundheads]].\n\nThe first siege was led by [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1643; the second was during the following year. Following this, a \"Council of War\" was held in Warrington in 1646 at which it was decided that the castle should be [[Slighting|slighted]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=57\u201358.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1656, Runcorn was described as being \"nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements\".<ref>King, Daniel, ''The Vale Royal of England'', 1656 (quoted in {{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=73.}}).</ref> And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet. The only through traffic used the ferry which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.\n\n===Industrialisation===\n[[File:Halton Castle engraving.jpg|thumb|270 px|[[Halton Castle]] in the 18th century]]\nDuring the 18th century, water transport had been improved in the area by the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]]. This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the canal system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the [[Port of Runcorn]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|pp=19\u201324.}} and {{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=125\u2013130.}}</ref>\n\nLater came the [[Runcorn to Latchford Canal]] linking with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, and the Weston Canal which gave better access to the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation]] system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=173.}}</ref>\n\nIndustries began to develop within and around the town, in particular shipbuilding, engineering, chemical manufacturing, tanning, and [[sandstone]] quarrying. Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early years of the 19th century, the town was a health resort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=133\u2013137.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Paul's (drawing).jpg|thumb|St Paul's Methodist Chapel, since demolished]]\nThe growth of industry by the early 19th century had not diminished Runcorn's reputation as a health resort and in 1822 the town's first Saltwater Baths opened. This was followed by new visitor accommodation in 1831 at Belvedere Terrace \"for the reception of visitors in search of health and pleasure\".<ref name=\"New Town Masterplan\" />\n\nIn the middle of the century, the growing wealth of the town and its industrialists saw the construction of several new landmarks, including [[Runcorn Town Hall|Halton Grange]], St Paul's Methodist Chapel and [[All Saints' Church, Runcorn|All Saints' Church]].<ref name=\"vardy\">{{cite journal | quotes = | last =Vardy | first = Peter I.| authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year = 2006 | month = | title =Thomas Hazlehurst and his family: Methodism and the Early Chemical Industry in Runcorn in the Nineteenth Century | journal =Cheshire History | volume = 45| issue = | pages =67\u201382 | issn = 0141-8696 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nFor hundreds of years, the only means of crossing the River Mersey had been by the Runcorn ferry. [[Thomas Telford]] proposed a {{convert|1000|ft|m}} single span suspension bridge as early as 1817, but it was not until 1868 that the first bridge, [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]], was opened across the Mersey at Runcorn. This gave the town direct rail links with [[Liverpool]] and the rest of the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|p=206.}}</ref>\n\nRuncorn was becoming an industrialised and highly polluted town. During the later 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries. In the 1880s a pipeline was opened between [[Northwich]] and Weston Point, supplying brine to the salt works and in 1896 the Castner Kellner chemical works was established.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=160\u2013162.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was opened throughout its length.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=184.}}</ref> This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], some of them calling at the port of Runcorn. The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number of people involved in constructing the ship canal.\n\nIn 1905, the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=17.}}</ref> This would not be replaced until 1961 with the construction of Runcorn Road Bridge (since renamed the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]]) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th&nbsp;century, the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning. This growth was largely due to government fixed-priced cost contracts for tanned hides. In 1926, four chemical companies merged to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the tanneries closed (the last to close was the Highfield Tannery in the late 1960s) and the chemical industry declined. At the same time, light industry developed together with warehouses and distribution centres.<ref name=\"ep\">{{citation |url=http://www.ebusinessdirectories.co.uk/BusinessDirectories/Pages/HaltonBD2006/alive.html |title=Halton Business Directory |accessdate=1 September 2007 |publisher=Halton Borough Council |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070822004655/http://www.ebusinessdirectories.co.uk/BusinessDirectories/Pages/HaltonBD2006/alive.html |archivedate = 22 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000; height:17px;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1901\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1911\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1921\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1931\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1941\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1951\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 1961\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| Population\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 16,491\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 17,353\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 18,476\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 18,127\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 21,718\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 23,931\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:#000;\"| 26,035\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"14\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"|''Source:<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10062263&c_id=10001043&add=N |title=Runcorn UD: Total Population |accessdate=16 October 2012 |publisher=A Vision of Britain through Time}}</ref>''\n|}\n\n===New Town designation===\n[[File:Southgate Estate, Runcorn, August 1989, 2.jpg|thumb|The ill-fated [[Southgate Estate]] in Runcorn New Town]]\nRuncorn was designated a new town in 1964 primarily to meet Liverpool's need for more housing land.<ref name=\"Tale of Two Centres\">{{cite journal| last = Couch| first = Chris| last2 = Fowles| first2 = Steven| date = 2006| title = Britain: Runcorn \u2014 A Tale of Two Centres| jstor = 23289488| journal = Built Environment| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 88\u2013102}}</ref> The new town masterplan published in 1966 more than doubled the population as it swallowed neighbouring settlements to the south and east, including [[Halton, Runcorn|Halton Village]], [[Weston, Runcorn|Weston]], Clifton and [[Norton, Runcorn|Norton]], and new housing developments were created on greenfield land at Halton Lodge, Halton Brook, Palace Fields, The Brow, Castlefields, Murdishaw, Beechwood, Brookvale and Windmill Hill.

Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|the series finale]], both Sheldon and Amy are recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for their discovery of super asymmetry which they first worked on moments before their wedding. In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want. Instead of giving a self-centered speech, Sheldon [[The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_12)#speech|thanks]] his family, his friends and his wife Amy for always supporting him.\n\nHe once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers [[Barry Kripke]] and [[Leslie Winkle]]. Later, Wheaton managed to patch things up with Sheldon, only to inadvertently pass the enemy list spot to [[Brent Spiner]].<ref name=S05E05>{{cite episode|title=The Russian Rocket Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep5|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2011|season=5|number=5|minutes=}}</ref> Sheldon would later resume his enmity with Wheaton in season 11's \"The Proton Regeneration\" when they compete for the lead role in an Internet reboot of Sheldon's childhood favorite science TV series, ''Professor Proton'', and Wheaton gets the part; however, when he sees how well Wheaton plays the role and on the advice of Howard, he apologizes to him.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n=== General ===\n[[File:\u0414\u0432\u0443\u0445\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442.jpg|thumb|Sheldon Cooper doing the [[Vulcan salute]], stencil graffiti on a wall in [[Volgograd]], [[Russia]]]]\nBoth the character and Parsons' portrayal have received widespread acclaim, and is often cited as the main reason for the program's success by critics and fans alike.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/the_tab/the_buzz-39481582.html|title=The buzz: Jim Parsons as Sheldon|last=Oswald|first=Brad|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=January 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313081930/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/the_tab/the_buzz-39481582.html|archivedate=March 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/Television/article/575764|title=Nerd herd doing a bang-up job|last=Salem|first=Rob|date=January 24, 2009|work=The Toronto Star|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/02/08/gentle_twists_on_reliable_formulas_keep_viewers_hooked/|title=Gentle twists on reliable formulas keep viewers hooked|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|date=February 8, 2009|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: \"It's hard to imagine what ''The Big Bang Theory'' would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great portrayal of Sheldon Cooper\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/946/946275p1.html|title=\"The Friendship Algorithm\" Review|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' stated that \"there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/matt-roush-daily-review/what-a-year-3521.html|title=What a Year!|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218155304/http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/matt-roush-daily-review/what-a-year-3521.html|archivedate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that: \"Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic\".<ref name=\"EW2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20237937,00.html|title=The Big Bang Theory|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Parsons was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2009ptemmys/61stemmys_noms.php|title=61st Primetime Emmy\u00ae Awards &#124; Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|publisher=Cdn.emmys.tv|date=July 19, 2012|accessdate=July 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106152818/http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2009ptemmys/61stemmys_nomswin_pt.php?action=search_db#1|archivedate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> He was nominated again for the same award on July 8, 2010, and eventually won the award on August 29, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf|title=Complete Emmy listings|accessdate=July 8, 2010|publisher=Emmy Award|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215131620/http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf|archive-date=December 15, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On August 1, 2009, he won the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy]], with the show itself winning the award for [[TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy|Outstanding Achievement in Comedy]] for season 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/08/tca-awards-television-critics-association-news-.html|title=TCA Awards hail 'True Blood' and (finally) 'Battlestar Galactica'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> He was nominated again for the same award in 2010 and 2012.

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship.

The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]).

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle. Harishchandra saves his subject from wild animals.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|23\n|On his journey to Kashi, Vishwamitra creates many hurdles to deviate Harishchandra from dharma. He creates Mayamuni to misguide Harishchandra from the correct path. Vishwamitra's disciple Nakshatrik also keeps giving a hard time to Harishchandra throughout his journey. Vishwamitra creates a Betaal to scare Harishchandra and his family at night but Harishchandra kills him in a duel. Finally, they reach Kashi and Nakshatrik asks for the promised money. Unable to pay anything, Harishchandra asks for some time but Nakshatrik gives him the choice to back-out from his words as there is no way he can deliver his commitment. Taramati asks his husband to sell her off as a slave so that he can pay the money to Vishwamitra. A reluctant Harishchandra agrees for it.\n|-\n|24\n|A rich brahmin buys Taramati & her son and gave the asked money to Nakshatrik.

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle. Harishchandra saves his subject from wild animals.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|23\n|On his journey to Kashi, Vishwamitra creates many hurdles to deviate Harishchandra from dharma. He creates Mayamuni to misguide Harishchandra from the correct path. Vishwamitra's disciple Nakshatrik also keeps giving a hard time to Harishchandra throughout his journey. Vishwamitra creates a Betaal to scare Harishchandra and his family at night but Harishchandra kills him in a duel. Finally, they reach Kashi and Nakshatrik asks for the promised money. Unable to pay anything, Harishchandra asks for some time but Nakshatrik gives him the choice to back-out from his words as there is no way he can deliver his commitment. Taramati asks his husband to sell her off as a slave so that he can pay the money to Vishwamitra. A reluctant Harishchandra agrees for it.\n|-\n|24\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

They developed friendly relations with the peoples of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] (particularly the regional [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]), learning their hunting and fishing techniques developed for local conditions. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; they reclaimed farming land from the sea through building dikes to control water and drain certain wetlands. Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada (modern Quebec) and the British territories on New England and the coast, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Their competition in Europe played out in North America as well. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).\n\nWhile France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the M\u00ed'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British.  That was particularly evident in the early 1720s during [[Dummer's War]], but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.\n\nThe British had conquered Acadia in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755, preached against the 'English devils'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parkman|first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Parkman|title=Montcalm and Wolfe|url=https://archive.org/details/montcalmandwolf08parkgoog|series=France and England in North America|year=1914|publisher=Little, Brown|orig-year=1884}}</ref> Acadians took part in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] and [[Fort Beausejour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grenier|first=John|title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710\u20131760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXoCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8566-8}}</ref> During the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat posed by the Acadians and to interrupt the vital supply lines which they provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749\u201361: A Study in Political Interaction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnxIPgAACAAJ&pg=PA105 |editor1-last=Buckner |editor1-first=Phillip Alfred |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Gail Grace |editor3-last=Frank |editor3-first=David |title=The Acadiensis Reader: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation |date=1998 |pages=105\u2013106}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=1744\u20131763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples|editor1=Phillip Buckner|editor2=John G.

''The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760.'' Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008.</ref> Acadians had numerous reasons against signing an oath of loyalty to the British Crown. As noted, the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Anglican Church of England. Acadian men feared that signing the oath would commit them to fighting against France during wartime. They also worried about whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive an oath as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than that of the indigenous Mi'kmaq. Acadians believed that if they signed the oath, they might put their villages at risk of attack by the Mi'kmaq.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=John G.|title=Nova Scotia: A Pocket History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-69QAAACAAJ&pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=Fernwood |isbn=978-1-55266-325-7|page=49}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Acadians 2, inset of painting by Samuel Scott of Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians at Annapolis Royal by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], 1751, earliest image of Acadians; the only pre-deportation image of Acadians\nFile: Acadians, Inset of painting by Samuel Scott Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], Annapolis Royal, 1751\n</gallery>\n\n==Deportation==\n{{Main|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:La Deportation des Acadiens par Henri Beau.jpg|thumb|The Deportation of Acadians by Henri Beau]]\n[[File:A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grymross, by Thomas Davies, 1758.JPG|thumb|[[St. John River Campaign]]: ''A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross'' (present-day [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]) by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].]]\n\nIn the Great Expulsion (known by French speakers as ''le Grand D\u00e9rangement''), after the [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] beginning in August 1755 under [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Governor Lawrence]], approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes burned. The Acadians were deported to separated locations throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies, from New England to Georgia. Although the British took measures during the embarkation of the Acadians to the transport ships, some families became split up.\n\nAfter 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who later went to Louisiana sailed there from France on five Spanish ships. These had been provided by the Spanish Crown, which was eager to populate their Louisiana colony with Catholic settlers who might provide farmers to supply the needs of New Orleans residents. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany, and kept this effort secret in order to avoid angering the French King. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, and gradually their descendants developed the Cajun population (which included multiracial unions and children) and culture. They continued to be attached to French culture and language, and Catholicism.\n\n[[Image:Grand Pr\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|Sculptor [[Louis-Philippe H\u00e9bert]]'s sculpture of [[Evangeline]] at the [[Grand-Pr\u00e9 National Historic Site]] in [[Nova Scotia]]]]\n\nThe Spanish offered the Acadians they had transported lowlands along the Mississippi River, in order to block British expansion from the East. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769, the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]] to resettle along the [[Iberville River|Iberville]] or [[Amite River|Amite]] rivers closer to [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Jack D.L.|title=A Guide to Spanish Louisiana, 1762-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfEvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5|year=1970|publisher=A. F. Laborde|page=5}}</ref>\n\nThe British conducted a second and smaller expulsion of Acadians after taking control of the North Shore of what is now [[New Brunswick]]. After the [[fall of Quebec]] and defeat of the French, the British lost interest in such relocations. Many Acadians gradually returned to [[British North America]], settling in coastal villages that were not occupied by colonists from New England. A few of the Acadians in this area had evaded the British for several years but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now [[Fredericton]], but were later displaced when the Crown awarded land grants to numerous [[United Empire Loyalists]] from the Thirteen Colonies after the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada]] issued a [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|Royal Proclamation]] acknowledging the deportation. She established July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the \"[[Great Upheaval]]\" on some English-language calendars.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:The Acadians.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Present-day Acadian communities]]\nThe Acadian descendants today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec, Canada, and in Louisiana and Maine, United States. In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick, from [[Miscou Island]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|\u00cele Miscou}}) [[\u00cele Lam\u00e8que]] including Caraquet in the center, to Neguac in the southern part, Grande-Anse in the eastern part and [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]] through to [[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]] in the northern part. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the [[Magdalen Islands]] and throughout other parts of Quebec. Many ethnic Acadian descendants still live in and around the area of [[Madawaska, Maine]], where some of the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, at [[Ch\u00e9ticamp]], [[Isle Madame]], and [[Clare, Nova Scotia|Clare]]. East and West [[Pubnico (village), Nova Scotia|Pubnico]], located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions that are predominantly ethnic Acadian.\n\nOther ethnic Acadians can be found in the southern and eastern regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these latter communities have assimilated to varying degrees into the majority culture of English speakers. For many families in predominantly [[English Language|Anglophone]] communities, French-[[language attrition]] has occurred, particularly in younger generations.\n\nThe Acadians who settled in [[Louisiana]] after 1764 became known as Cajuns for the culture they developed. They have had a dominant cultural influence in many [[Parish (subnational entity)|parishes]], particularly in the southwestern area of the state, which is known as [[Acadiana]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Tintamarre during National Acadian Day 2009, Caraquet New Brunswick.jpg|thumb|The [[Tintamarre]] in [[Caraquet]], [[New Brunswick]]]]\n\nToday Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and in Louisiana (Cajuns) and northern Maine, United States. Since 1994, ''[[Le Congr\u00e8s Mondial Acadien]]'' has worked as an organization to unite this disparate communities and help preserve the culture.\n\nIn 1881, Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], New Brunswick, designated August 15, the Christian feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]], as the [[National Acadian Day|national feast day]] of their community. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having a ''[[tintamarre]],'' a big parade and procession for which people dress up with the colors of Acadia and make a lot of noise and music.\n\nThe [[national anthem]] of the Acadians is \"[[Ave Maris Stella]]\", adopted in 1884 at [[Miscouche]], Prince Edward Island. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de l'Acadie. The second, third and fourth verses were translated into [[French language|French]], with the first and last kept in the original [[Latin]].\n\nThe Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island have resolved to commemorate December 13 annually as \"Acadian Remembrance Day,\" in memory of the sinking of the ''[[Duke William]]'' and of the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who died in 1758 while being deported across the North Atlantic: from hunger, disease and drowning.<ref>''Pioneer Journal'', Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref> The event has been commemorated annually since 2004; participants mark the day by wearing a black star.\n\n==Representation in other media==\n* In the 21st century, cartoons and animated films have been produced that feature Acadian characters. In addition there is a TV show named ''[[Acadieman]].''\n\n===Legacy of The Expulsion===\n[[Image:Evangeline - Saint Martinville.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Longfellow's ''Evangeline'' \u2013 at [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], Louisiana.]]\n\n* American writer [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[Evangeline]]'', an epic poem loosely based on the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic. Activists used it as a catalyst in reviving a distinct  Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana.\n* In the early 20th century, two statues were made of the fictional figure of \"Evangeline\" to commemorate the Expulsion: one was installed in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]] and the other in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]]. \n* Canadian musician [[Robbie Robertson]] wrote a popular song based on the Acadian Expulsion, entitled \"[[Acadian Driftwood]]\". It was a track on [[The Band]]'s 1975 album, ''[[Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross]]''.\n* [[Antonine Maillet]]'s novel ''[[P\u00e9lagie-la-charette]]'' concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families, starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.\n* The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) has an eternal flame;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acadianmemorial.org/the-eternal-flame.php | title = Acadian Memorial - The Eternal Flame | access-date = October 18, 2012}}</ref> it honors the 3,000 Acadians who settled in Louisiana after the Expulsion.\n* Monuments to the Acadian Expulsion gave been erected at several sites in the Maritime Provinces, such as at [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]], Nova Scotia, and at [[Beaubears Island]].\n\n=== Flags ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Flag of Acadiana.svg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| caption1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| image2 = Flag of the New England Acadians.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = Flag of the New England Acadians\n| caption2 = Flag of the [[New England]] Acadians\n| footer = \n}}\nThe [[Flag of Acadia|flag of the Acadians]] is the French [[drapeau tricolore|tricolour]], with the addition of a golden star in the blue field (see above).

This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.\n\nAcadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. In 1974 it was adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the [[Acadiana]] region.

The British prohibited them from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia. Before the [[American Revolutionary War|US Revolutionary War]], the Crown settled Protestant European immigrants and [[New England Planters]] in former Acadian communities and farmland. After the war, it made land grants in Nova Scotia to Loyalists (including nearly 3,000 [[Black Loyalists]], [[freed slave|slaves of rebels]] given freedom after joining British forces). British policy was to establish a majority culture of Protestant religions, and to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled.<ref name=lock/>\n\nAcadians speak a variety of French called [[Acadian French]].

They developed friendly relations with the peoples of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] (particularly the regional [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]), learning their hunting and fishing techniques developed for local conditions. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; they reclaimed farming land from the sea through building dikes to control water and drain certain wetlands. Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada (modern Quebec) and the British territories on New England and the coast, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Their competition in Europe played out in North America as well. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).\n\nWhile France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the M\u00ed'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British.  That was particularly evident in the early 1720s during [[Dummer's War]], but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.\n\nThe British had conquered Acadia in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755, preached against the 'English devils'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parkman|first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Parkman|title=Montcalm and Wolfe|url=https://archive.org/details/montcalmandwolf08parkgoog|series=France and England in North America|year=1914|publisher=Little, Brown|orig-year=1884}}</ref> Acadians took part in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] and [[Fort Beausejour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grenier|first=John|title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710\u20131760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXoCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8566-8}}</ref> During the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat posed by the Acadians and to interrupt the vital supply lines which they provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749\u201361: A Study in Political Interaction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnxIPgAACAAJ&pg=PA105 |editor1-last=Buckner |editor1-first=Phillip Alfred |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Gail Grace |editor3-last=Frank |editor3-first=David |title=The Acadiensis Reader: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation |date=1998 |pages=105\u2013106}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=1744\u20131763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples|editor1=Phillip Buckner|editor2=John G.

The French and British competition had a long history, including opposing Christian established religions: Catholic in France and its colonies, and Protestant (Anglican) in England.<ref>For the best account of Acadian armed resistance to the British, see Grenier, John. ''The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760.'' Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008.</ref> Acadians had numerous reasons against signing an oath of loyalty to the British Crown. As noted, the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Anglican Church of England. Acadian men feared that signing the oath would commit them to fighting against France during wartime. They also worried about whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive an oath as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than that of the indigenous Mi'kmaq. Acadians believed that if they signed the oath, they might put their villages at risk of attack by the Mi'kmaq.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=John G.|title=Nova Scotia: A Pocket History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-69QAAACAAJ&pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=Fernwood |isbn=978-1-55266-325-7|page=49}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Acadians 2, inset of painting by Samuel Scott of Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians at Annapolis Royal by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], 1751, earliest image of Acadians; the only pre-deportation image of Acadians\nFile: Acadians, Inset of painting by Samuel Scott Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], Annapolis Royal, 1751\n</gallery>\n\n==Deportation==\n{{Main|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grymross, by Thomas Davies, 1758.JPG|thumb|[[St. John River Campaign]]: ''A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross'' (present-day [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]) by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].]]\n\nIn the Great Expulsion (known by French speakers as ''le Grand D\u00e9rangement''), after the [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] beginning in August 1755 under [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Governor Lawrence]], approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes burned. The Acadians were deported to separated locations throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies, from New England to Georgia. Although the British took measures during the embarkation of the Acadians to the transport ships, some families became split up.\n\nAfter 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who later went to Louisiana sailed there from France on five Spanish ships. These had been provided by the Spanish Crown, which was eager to populate their Louisiana colony with Catholic settlers who might provide farmers to supply the needs of New Orleans residents. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany, and kept this effort secret in order to avoid angering the French King. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, and gradually their descendants developed the Cajun population (which included multiracial unions and children) and culture. They continued to be attached to French culture and language, and Catholicism.\n\n[[Image:Grand Pr\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|Sculptor [[Louis-Philippe H\u00e9bert]]'s sculpture of [[Evangeline]] at the [[Grand-Pr\u00e9 National Historic Site]] in [[Nova Scotia]]]]\n\nThe Spanish offered the Acadians they had transported lowlands along the Mississippi River, in order to block British expansion from the East. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769, the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]] to resettle along the [[Iberville River|Iberville]] or [[Amite River|Amite]] rivers closer to [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Jack D.L.|title=A Guide to Spanish Louisiana, 1762-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfEvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5|year=1970|publisher=A. F. Laborde|page=5}}</ref>\n\nThe British conducted a second and smaller expulsion of Acadians after taking control of the North Shore of what is now [[New Brunswick]]. After the [[fall of Quebec]] and defeat of the French, the British lost interest in such relocations. Many Acadians gradually returned to [[British North America]], settling in coastal villages that were not occupied by colonists from New England. A few of the Acadians in this area had evaded the British for several years but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now [[Fredericton]], but were later displaced when the Crown awarded land grants to numerous [[United Empire Loyalists]] from the Thirteen Colonies after the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada]] issued a [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|Royal Proclamation]] acknowledging the deportation. She established July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the \"[[Great Upheaval]]\" on some English-language calendars.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:The Acadians.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Present-day Acadian communities]]\nThe Acadian descendants today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec, Canada, and in Louisiana and Maine, United States. In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick, from [[Miscou Island]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|\u00cele Miscou}}) [[\u00cele Lam\u00e8que]] including Caraquet in the center, to Neguac in the southern part, Grande-Anse in the eastern part and [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]] through to [[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]] in the northern part. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the [[Magdalen Islands]] and throughout other parts of Quebec. Many ethnic Acadian descendants still live in and around the area of [[Madawaska, Maine]], where some of the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, at [[Ch\u00e9ticamp]], [[Isle Madame]], and [[Clare, Nova Scotia|Clare]]. East and West [[Pubnico (village), Nova Scotia|Pubnico]], located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions that are predominantly ethnic Acadian.\n\nOther ethnic Acadians can be found in the southern and eastern regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these latter communities have assimilated to varying degrees into the majority culture of English speakers. For many families in predominantly [[English Language|Anglophone]] communities, French-[[language attrition]] has occurred, particularly in younger generations.\n\nThe Acadians who settled in [[Louisiana]] after 1764 became known as Cajuns for the culture they developed. They have had a dominant cultural influence in many [[Parish (subnational entity)|parishes]], particularly in the southwestern area of the state, which is known as [[Acadiana]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Tintamarre during National Acadian Day 2009, Caraquet New Brunswick.jpg|thumb|The [[Tintamarre]] in [[Caraquet]], [[New Brunswick]]]]\n\nToday Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and in Louisiana (Cajuns) and northern Maine, United States. Since 1994, ''[[Le Congr\u00e8s Mondial Acadien]]'' has worked as an organization to unite this disparate communities and help preserve the culture.\n\nIn 1881, Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], New Brunswick, designated August 15, the Christian feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]], as the [[National Acadian Day|national feast day]] of their community. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having a ''[[tintamarre]],'' a big parade and procession for which people dress up with the colors of Acadia and make a lot of noise and music.\n\nThe [[national anthem]] of the Acadians is \"[[Ave Maris Stella]]\", adopted in 1884 at [[Miscouche]], Prince Edward Island. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de l'Acadie. The second, third and fourth verses were translated into [[French language|French]], with the first and last kept in the original [[Latin]].\n\nThe Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island have resolved to commemorate December 13 annually as \"Acadian Remembrance Day,\" in memory of the sinking of the ''[[Duke William]]'' and of the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who died in 1758 while being deported across the North Atlantic: from hunger, disease and drowning.<ref>''Pioneer Journal'', Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref> The event has been commemorated annually since 2004; participants mark the day by wearing a black star.\n\n==Representation in other media==\n* In the 21st century, cartoons and animated films have been produced that feature Acadian characters. In addition there is a TV show named ''[[Acadieman]].''\n\n===Legacy of The Expulsion===\n[[Image:Evangeline - Saint Martinville.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Longfellow's ''Evangeline'' \u2013 at [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], Louisiana.]]\n\n* American writer [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[Evangeline]]'', an epic poem loosely based on the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic. Activists used it as a catalyst in reviving a distinct  Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana.\n* In the early 20th century, two statues were made of the fictional figure of \"Evangeline\" to commemorate the Expulsion: one was installed in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]] and the other in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]]. \n* Canadian musician [[Robbie Robertson]] wrote a popular song based on the Acadian Expulsion, entitled \"[[Acadian Driftwood]]\". It was a track on [[The Band]]'s 1975 album, ''[[Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross]]''.\n* [[Antonine Maillet]]'s novel ''[[P\u00e9lagie-la-charette]]'' concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families, starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.\n* The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) has an eternal flame;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acadianmemorial.org/the-eternal-flame.php | title = Acadian Memorial - The Eternal Flame | access-date = October 18, 2012}}</ref> it honors the 3,000 Acadians who settled in Louisiana after the Expulsion.\n* Monuments to the Acadian Expulsion gave been erected at several sites in the Maritime Provinces, such as at [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]], Nova Scotia, and at [[Beaubears Island]].\n\n=== Flags ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Flag of Acadiana.svg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| caption1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| image2 = Flag of the New England Acadians.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = Flag of the New England Acadians\n| caption2 = Flag of the [[New England]] Acadians\n| footer = \n}}\nThe [[Flag of Acadia|flag of the Acadians]] is the French [[drapeau tricolore|tricolour]], with the addition of a golden star in the blue field (see above).

This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.\n\nAcadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. In 1974 it was adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the [[Acadiana]] region.

The magazine [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] published a cartoon entitled \"An Unequal Match\" that October highlighting the dangers of unarmed police. The case was instramental in bringing about the arming of police officers, although it required a second fatal shooting, that of P.C. George Cole by a burglar, in 1882 and an attempted murder, of P.C. Patrick Boans, in 1883 before the authorities gave Superintendents the opportunity to arm their constables on night duty.\n\nFred Atkins was born in [[Walton-on-Thames]] in 1859, the son of a greengrocer, and joined the [[Metropolitan Police Service|police]] in 14 May 1877<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C14161822|title=Name: Fred Atkins .

The house was owned by Harry Powys-Keck, a [[Justice of the peace|Justice Of The Peace]] of [[Stoughton Grange]], Leicestershire. In that period police officers would check the security of larger residential houses by special request, especially as there had been a series of burglaries in the region; Woodlands, the residence of Miss Finch, which adjoins Mr. Powys Keck's grounds, was broken into on the Tuesday.<ref name=Woolwich />\n \n\n===The shooting===\n\nP.C.

Mrs Snow told Mr J Bloomfield, the valet, that she had heard moaning. They opened the front door and found the constable lying on the ground. They did not immediately know that he was shot, thinking him in a fit, and placed him on a mat outside and offering him water.

Instead he was taken to Kingston Police Station where he was examined by Dr Roots. PC Atkins had been wounded in three places, the abdomen, chest and left thigh. The bullet to the chest had penetrated the lungs; the bullet remained in his back.

From this it is inferred that the initials on the handle are those of its possessor and not of its maker. The lantern is of the bull's-eye pattern, and presents no strange features beyond being of a rather better kind than that used by most burglars, while the bullets recovered are of a conical shape, and so large as to warrant the belief that the revolver or pistol used was of American manufacture.

About 20 Minutes past 1 o'clock on Thursday morning Brown was awakened from his sleep by the opening of the gate, and from his window he saw the Flashing of a light from a bull's eye lantern, which he believed was carried by Police-constable Atkins, a voice at the same time calling out \"All right.\" The officer proceeded in the direction of the house, and Brown remained undisturbed till about 20 minutes to 2 o'clock, when he was called up and informed that a policeman had been shot.  He then hastened to the front of the house, where he found William Short, the butler, and Bloomfield, the valet, standing near the policemen, who was lying on the ground, close to the recess on the right of the entrance near the small window by which the burglars had tried to enter the mansion. That the officer was totally unaware of his proximity to his assailants is manifest from the replies which be gave to the interrogatories put to him before he died at the police station.

Crowds of spectators flocked into the place, and nearly all the shops had shutters up. Altogether, there could not have been far short of 2,000 police constables present. All who could be spared from Richmond, headed by Inspectors Aldridge and Fairey (Inspector Pearman being on the sick list} together with the members of the Volunteer Fire Brigade (with their captain, Mr. T. Covell) and some other visitors, were conveyed to Walton in two omnibuses and a break, which left Richmond soon after twelve o'clock, the Barnes contingent, under Inspector Harbor, having preceded them about half an hour. There were also about twenty-five constables from Brentford and fifteen from Chiswick. At Walton the police were drawn up two deep, and lined the route on both sides of the road from the High-street to the parish church, a distance of some 300 yards. The remains of the deceased lay at the residence of his father, in the High-street, and it was from there that the funeral cortege started. The funeral had been announced for a quarter-past two, and shortly after that time the well-known and solemn strains of the [[Saul (Handel)|\"Dead March\u201d]] conveyed to the thousands of spectators who thronged the road an intimation that the impressive ceremony had commenced. At the head of the procession rode Superintendent Digby, of the V division, to which the deceased belonged, followed by an advance party of fifty of Atkins' more immediate comrades, who are attached to the stations at Richmond and Kingston. Next in order came the band of the V division, immediately succeeded by the coffin containing all that was mortal of the unfortunate constable. This was borne by six of his intimate acquaintances in the force during life, while the pall, which was literally covered with wreaths of beautiful white blossoms, including a very handsome one from Richmond, was supported by eight bearers. Behind walked the parents and the seven brothers and sisters of the deceased, and a numerous train of mourners, including several members of the household at The Knoll, near were the murder was perpetrated. The rear of the procession was brought up by the men belonging to the Walton, Wimbledon, Richmond, and Kingston and Surbiton Fire Brigades, all of whom appeared in uniform, and the members of the local lodges of [[Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity|Oddfellows and Foresters]] wearing mourning badges. It may be mentioned that the deceased was a member of the former society. The funeral cortege pursued its way from the house to the church amidst an impressive silence, broken only by the strains the \"Dead March\" that proceeded from the band. At the entrance to the churchyard the procession was met by the Rev. T. J. M\u2019Cowan, the vicar of the parish, by whom the service was conducted. The coffin was conveyed to the interior of the church, where the preliminaries were gone through and from thence it was taken to the graveside. Here the Vicar read the burial service, at the conclusion of which Mrs and Miss Digby stepped forward and placed two splendid wreaths upon the coffin lid. Wreaths were also placed there on behalf of the E and P divisions, and by various friends of the deceased, and then the last sad rite was performed, and the coffin lowered slowly into its resting place. The coffin was of polished elm, and on it was the simple inscription, \"Fred. Atkins, died September 23rd, 1881, aged 23.\"  At the conclusion of the service an address was read over the grave by a member of the lodge of Oddfellows, while a friend of the deceased delivered a funeral oration with impressive emphasis, in the course of which he bore testimony to his many good qualities, and pointed out that he died in the performance of his duties. Superintendent Fisher, of the T division, and a large number of inspectors were present at the service. The arrangements were admirably carried out by Superintendent Digby, at what proved to be the largest police demonstration of the kind that has occurred for many years. Subsequently, the men returned to their several destinations by special trains.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=THE MURDER OF A POLICE CONSTABLE|last=|first=|date=1 October 1881|work=Richmond & Twickenham Times|access-date=|page=6}}</ref>\n|}\n\n\n==Memorials==\n\nThere is a memorial to him erected in 1996 outside Kingston Police Station.

The house was owned by Harry Powys-Keck, a [[Justice of the peace|Justice Of The Peace]] of [[Stoughton Grange]], Leicestershire. In that period police officers would check the security of larger residential houses by special request, especially as there had been a series of burglaries in the region; Woodlands, the residence of Miss Finch, which adjoins Mr. Powys Keck's grounds, was broken into on the Tuesday.<ref name=Woolwich />\n \n\n===The shooting===\n\nP.C.

They did not immediately know that he was shot, thinking him in a fit, and placed him on a mat outside and offering him water.

They then sent for Dr. W.H. Roots, the Divisional police surgeon. Atkins could not be taken to the nearest hospital at [[Surbiton]] because of his serious condition. Instead he was taken to Kingston Police Station where he was examined by Dr Roots. PC Atkins had been wounded in three places, the abdomen, chest and left thigh. The bullet to the chest had penetrated the lungs; the bullet remained in his back. A second bullet was found at the scene while the third was found in his clothing at the station.<ref name=Comet24 />\n\nConstable Atkins did not die immediately, and before his death was able to tell colleagues that he neither saw nor heard anything before the shots. \"I did not see anybody or hear anything which should me to imagine there were burglars at work.

The lantern is of the bull's-eye pattern, and presents no strange features beyond being of a rather better kind than that used by most burglars, while the bullets recovered are of a conical shape, and so large as to warrant the belief that the revolver or pistol used was of American manufacture.

The ambitious young heroine, Thea Kronborg, leaves her hometown to go to Chicago to fulfill her dream of becoming a well-trained pianist, a better piano teacher. When her instructor hears her voice, he realizes that this is her true artistic gift. He encourages her to pursue her vocal training instead of piano saying, \"your voice is worth all that you can put into it. I have not come to this decision rashly\" (Part II, Chapter 7). In that pursuit she travels to Dresden, then to New York City, singing operas. Her reference for life is always her home town and the people she encountered there.\n\nThe novel captures Thea's independent-mindedness, her strong work ethic, and her ascent to her highest achievement. At each step along the way, her realization of the mediocrity of her peers propels her to greater levels of accomplishment, but in the course of her ascent she must discard those relationships which no longer serve her.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Part I: Friends of Childhood===\nIn Moonstone, Colorado, Doctor Archie helps Mrs. Kronborg give birth to her son, Thor. The Doctor takes care of their daughter, Thea, who is sick with pneumonia. The next year Thea goes to the Kohlers for piano lessons with Wunsch and practices daily for two hours (or four hours if school is not in session). The doctor goes to Spanish Johnny who is sick. Later, Ray Kennedy goes out to the countryside with Johnny, his wife, Thea, Axel, and Gunner. Although she is only twelve and he is thirty, Ray dreams of marrying her when she is old enough. They tell stories of striking it rich in silver mines in the west.\n\nBefore Christmas, Thea plays the piano at a concert, but the town paper praises her rival Lily which upsets Thea, as she wanted to sing rather than perform an instrumental piece. Tillie turns down the local drama club's notion to have Thea play a part in ''The Drummer Boy of Shiloh'', knowing that acting is not her niece's talent. After Christmas, Wunsch tells Thea about a Spanish opera singer who could sing an [[alto]] part of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. She sings for him. He says she needs to learn German for many of the good songs. Wunsch gets so drunk that he behaves badly and hurts himself. Ten days later, all of his students discontinue their lessons with him, and he leaves the town. Shortly after, Thea drops out of school and takes up his students; at fifteen she begins to work full-time.\n\nThea and her mother enjoy a trip to [[Denver]] on Ray's freight train, riding in the [[caboose]]. They stop for lunch with the station agent at a town along the way. That fall, Mr. Kronborg insists that Thea help at the Wednesday prayer meeting by playing the organ and leading the hymns, and she does. At fifteen, religion perplexes Thea, as typhoid kills her schoolmates and a local tramp, the source of the infection, is made to leave town; she wonders if the Bible tells people to help him instead. Dr. Archie tells her that people have to look after themselves. On the way from Moonstone to Saxony, Ray's train has an accident and the next day he bids an emotional goodbye to Thea before he dies. After the funeral, Dr. Archie informs Mr. Kronborg that Ray has bequeathed six hundred dollars to Thea for her to go to [[Chicago]] and study music there. Her father agrees to let her go despite her only being seventeen.\n\n===Part II: The Song of the Lark===\nIn Chicago, Thea settles close to the parish of a Swedish Reformed Church with two German women. She sings in the choir and in funerals for a stipend, and she takes piano lessons with Mr. Harsanyi. When Mr. Harsanyi learns Thea sings in a church choir, he asks her to sing. He is very impressed by her voice. Later, he meets with the conductor of the [[Chicago Orchestra]] and asks him who is the best voice teacher in the area; it is Madison Bowers. He then parts with Thea, explaining that her voice is her true artistic gift, not her playing. After several weeks of singing lessons, she takes a train back to Moonstone for her summer vacation. She has grown. She goes to a Mexican ball with Spanish Johnny and sings for them, feeling the pleasure of the audience for the first time. Back in her house, Anna reproaches her for singing for them and not their father's church. She returns to Chicago in the fall.\n\n===Part III: Stupid Faces===\nIn Chicago, Thea moves from one home to another. She takes daily singing lessons, spending the afternoons as accompanist for Bowers' more accomplished students. She grows tired of them, not all people like the warm and  intelligent Harsanyis. Fred Ottenburg shows up for lessons, a man who is educated, lively and closer to her age than all her male teachers. He introduces her to the Nathanmeyers, a Jewish family who loves operatic music and her style of singing. They invite her to sing at their musical evenings, helping her with proper dress. Thea catches an infection and does not fully recover; she needs a break in her familiar desert setting but will not return to her family until she has accomplished something. Fred suggests that she spend the summer on a ranch in Arizona where there are some of the cliff homes of the ancient peoples that Thea has longed to see.\n\n===Part IV: The Ancient People===\nThea gets off the train at [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], seeing the [[San Francisco Peaks]] to reach the Bitmer home. She recoups her health, with days in the canyon, resting in one of the ancient cliff dwellings, while sharing the meals of Mr. and Mrs. Bitmer. She comes to know herself better in the moments of isolation. Ottenburg joins her in July. After much direct conversation, they kiss. They take refuge from a severe storm, and then make a daring trek back to the ranch in the dark, met by Bitmer with a lantern. They talk of what is next; Thea thinks she is in love and considers marrying him. Fred suggests a visit to [[Mexico City]], before getting her to Germany, where he feels she belongs, for her singing. Ottenburg does not tell her he married eight years earlier, though he and his wife have been estranged for most of those years, keeping up appearances.\n\n===Part V: Doctor Archie's Venture===\nIn Denver, Dr. Archie receives a telegram from Thea summoning him to New York City and asking him to lend her money so that she can study singing in Germany. Fred told Thea about his marriage in Mexico City, and Thea accepts it, but makes it clear the limits his first marriage imposes on them. She tells Archie about this.  In New York she tells Fred that she will leave and will not accept his financial help. Archie goes to dinner with Ottenburg and Thea. The next day, Fred leaves to tend his dying mother. Thea ponders the risks of her ambition, realizes she is young, just 20, and heads to Germany.\n\n===Part VI: Ten Years Later===\nTen years after Thea leaves for Germany, Dr. Archie lives in Denver after his mining investments succeed and his wife has died. His life is better. He was involved in politics but is now tired of it. He wants to go to New York City, as does Fred, where Thea is performing. He has not seen her in ten years. Four years after she left for Germany, Thea's father died of disease and Mrs. Kronborg began to fail without him. Thea ached to go home to her mother, but opportunity opened in the opera company in Dresden for her before she could go home. Dr. Archie tries to keep Mrs. Kronborg's spirits up, but she dies. Thea has paid back the loan to Dr. Archie already.\n\nIn  New York City, Thea performs at the Metropolitan Opera House. Dr. Archie and Fred are there to attend her performance. The three are good friends. Fred is still tied to his wife, who has been in a sanitarium for the last seven years; but he pines to raise a son. Thea is asked to replace an ill singer at the last minute, and she performs very well. Thea is then announced to sing the entire role of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre|Sieglinde]]'', in the program. This role is well-suited to her voice. Besides Archie and Fred, two other people from her past are in the audience\u2014Harsanyi, her teacher from Chicago, and Spanish Johnny, the Mexican mandolin player from Moonstone, who all deeply enjoy her performance, as does the entire audience. In the epilogue, Tillie Kronborg is in Moonstone, enjoying her niece's successes in the opera. She recalls hearing the famous Kronborg when the opera travelled to Kansas City, and she is happy.\n\n==Characters==\n;Moonstone\n* '''Thea Kronborg''': the protagonist.

It is generally considered to be the second novel in Cather's Prairie Trilogy, following ''[[O Pioneers!]]'' (1913) and preceding ''[[My \u00c1ntonia]]'' (1918).\n\nThe book tells the story of a talented artist born in a small town in Colorado who discovers and develops her singing voice. Her story is told against the backdrop of the burgeoning [[American West]] in which she was born in a town along the rail line, of fast-growing Chicago near the turn of the twentieth century, and of the audience for singers of her skills in the US compared to Europe. Thea Kronborg grows up, learning herself, her strengths and her talent, until she reaches success.\n\nThe title comes from a painting of the same name by [[Jules Adolphe Aim\u00e9 Louis Breton|Jules Breton]] in 1884 and part of the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].\n\n==Plot introduction==\n[[File:Jules Breton, le chant de l'alouette.1884.jpg|thumb|\"Song of the Lark\" by [[Jules Breton]], the painting that inspired the title of the book.]]\nSet in the 1890s in Moonstone, a fictional town in [[Colorado]], ''The Song of the Lark'' is the self-portrait of an artist in the making. The ambitious young heroine, Thea Kronborg, leaves her hometown to go to Chicago to fulfill her dream of becoming a well-trained pianist, a better piano teacher. When her instructor hears her voice, he realizes that this is her true artistic gift. He encourages her to pursue her vocal training instead of piano saying, \"your voice is worth all that you can put into it. I have not come to this decision rashly\" (Part II, Chapter 7). In that pursuit she travels to Dresden, then to New York City, singing operas. Her reference for life is always her home town and the people she encountered there.\n\nThe novel captures Thea's independent-mindedness, her strong work ethic, and her ascent to her highest achievement. At each step along the way, her realization of the mediocrity of her peers propels her to greater levels of accomplishment, but in the course of her ascent she must discard those relationships which no longer serve her.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Part I: Friends of Childhood===\nIn Moonstone, Colorado, Doctor Archie helps Mrs. Kronborg give birth to her son, Thor. The Doctor takes care of their daughter, Thea, who is sick with pneumonia. The next year Thea goes to the Kohlers for piano lessons with Wunsch and practices daily for two hours (or four hours if school is not in session). The doctor goes to Spanish Johnny who is sick. Later, Ray Kennedy goes out to the countryside with Johnny, his wife, Thea, Axel, and Gunner. Although she is only twelve and he is thirty, Ray dreams of marrying her when she is old enough. They tell stories of striking it rich in silver mines in the west.\n\nBefore Christmas, Thea plays the piano at a concert, but the town paper praises her rival Lily which upsets Thea, as she wanted to sing rather than perform an instrumental piece. Tillie turns down the local drama club's notion to have Thea play a part in ''The Drummer Boy of Shiloh'', knowing that acting is not her niece's talent. After Christmas, Wunsch tells Thea about a Spanish opera singer who could sing an [[alto]] part of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. She sings for him. He says she needs to learn German for many of the good songs. Wunsch gets so drunk that he behaves badly and hurts himself. Ten days later, all of his students discontinue their lessons with him, and he leaves the town. Shortly after, Thea drops out of school and takes up his students; at fifteen she begins to work full-time.\n\nThea and her mother enjoy a trip to [[Denver]] on Ray's freight train, riding in the [[caboose]]. They stop for lunch with the station agent at a town along the way. That fall, Mr. Kronborg insists that Thea help at the Wednesday prayer meeting by playing the organ and leading the hymns, and she does. At fifteen, religion perplexes Thea, as typhoid kills her schoolmates and a local tramp, the source of the infection, is made to leave town; she wonders if the Bible tells people to help him instead. Dr. Archie tells her that people have to look after themselves. On the way from Moonstone to Saxony, Ray's train has an accident and the next day he bids an emotional goodbye to Thea before he dies. After the funeral, Dr. Archie informs Mr. Kronborg that Ray has bequeathed six hundred dollars to Thea for her to go to [[Chicago]] and study music there. Her father agrees to let her go despite her only being seventeen.\n\n===Part II: The Song of the Lark===\nIn Chicago, Thea settles close to the parish of a Swedish Reformed Church with two German women. She sings in the choir and in funerals for a stipend, and she takes piano lessons with Mr. Harsanyi. When Mr. Harsanyi learns Thea sings in a church choir, he asks her to sing. He is very impressed by her voice. Later, he meets with the conductor of the [[Chicago Orchestra]] and asks him who is the best voice teacher in the area; it is Madison Bowers. He then parts with Thea, explaining that her voice is her true artistic gift, not her playing. After several weeks of singing lessons, she takes a train back to Moonstone for her summer vacation. She has grown. She goes to a Mexican ball with Spanish Johnny and sings for them, feeling the pleasure of the audience for the first time. Back in her house, Anna reproaches her for singing for them and not their father's church. She returns to Chicago in the fall.\n\n===Part III: Stupid Faces===\nIn Chicago, Thea moves from one home to another. She takes daily singing lessons, spending the afternoons as accompanist for Bowers' more accomplished students. She grows tired of them, not all people like the warm and  intelligent Harsanyis. Fred Ottenburg shows up for lessons, a man who is educated, lively and closer to her age than all her male teachers. He introduces her to the Nathanmeyers, a Jewish family who loves operatic music and her style of singing. They invite her to sing at their musical evenings, helping her with proper dress. Thea catches an infection and does not fully recover; she needs a break in her familiar desert setting but will not return to her family until she has accomplished something. Fred suggests that she spend the summer on a ranch in Arizona where there are some of the cliff homes of the ancient peoples that Thea has longed to see.\n\n===Part IV: The Ancient People===\nThea gets off the train at [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], seeing the [[San Francisco Peaks]] to reach the Bitmer home. She recoups her health, with days in the canyon, resting in one of the ancient cliff dwellings, while sharing the meals of Mr. and Mrs. Bitmer. She comes to know herself better in the moments of isolation. Ottenburg joins her in July. After much direct conversation, they kiss. They take refuge from a severe storm, and then make a daring trek back to the ranch in the dark, met by Bitmer with a lantern. They talk of what is next; Thea thinks she is in love and considers marrying him. Fred suggests a visit to [[Mexico City]], before getting her to Germany, where he feels she belongs, for her singing. Ottenburg does not tell her he married eight years earlier, though he and his wife have been estranged for most of those years, keeping up appearances.\n\n===Part V: Doctor Archie's Venture===\nIn Denver, Dr. Archie receives a telegram from Thea summoning him to New York City and asking him to lend her money so that she can study singing in Germany. Fred told Thea about his marriage in Mexico City, and Thea accepts it, but makes it clear the limits his first marriage imposes on them. She tells Archie about this.  In New York she tells Fred that she will leave and will not accept his financial help. Archie goes to dinner with Ottenburg and Thea. The next day, Fred leaves to tend his dying mother. Thea ponders the risks of her ambition, realizes she is young, just 20, and heads to Germany.\n\n===Part VI: Ten Years Later===\nTen years after Thea leaves for Germany, Dr. Archie lives in Denver after his mining investments succeed and his wife has died. His life is better. He was involved in politics but is now tired of it. He wants to go to New York City, as does Fred, where Thea is performing. He has not seen her in ten years. Four years after she left for Germany, Thea's father died of disease and Mrs. Kronborg began to fail without him. Thea ached to go home to her mother, but opportunity opened in the opera company in Dresden for her before she could go home. Dr. Archie tries to keep Mrs. Kronborg's spirits up, but she dies. Thea has paid back the loan to Dr. Archie already.\n\nIn  New York City, Thea performs at the Metropolitan Opera House. Dr. Archie and Fred are there to attend her performance. The three are good friends. Fred is still tied to his wife, who has been in a sanitarium for the last seven years; but he pines to raise a son. Thea is asked to replace an ill singer at the last minute, and she performs very well. Thea is then announced to sing the entire role of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre|Sieglinde]]'', in the program. This role is well-suited to her voice. Besides Archie and Fred, two other people from her past are in the audience\u2014Harsanyi, her teacher from Chicago, and Spanish Johnny, the Mexican mandolin player from Moonstone, who all deeply enjoy her performance, as does the entire audience. In the epilog, Tillie Kronborg is in Moonstone, enjoying her niece's successes in the opera. She recalls hearing the famous Kronborg when the opera travelled to Kansas City, and she is happy.\n\n==Characters==\n;Moonstone\n* '''Thea Kronborg''': the protagonist.

They have a son, '''Andor''' 6 years old, and  a daughter, '''Tanya''', 4 years old, when Thea meets them.
