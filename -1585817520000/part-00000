The terms ''Fortean'' and ''Forteana'' are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena. Fort's books sold well and are still in print.  His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as \"Forteans\", and has influenced some aspects of science fiction.\n\nFort's collections of scientific anomalies, including ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' (1919), influenced numerous science fiction writers with their iconoclastic [[skepticism]] and as sources of ideas. \"Fortean\" phenomena are events which seem to challenge the boundaries of accepted scientific knowledge, and the ''Fortean Times'' (founded as ''The News'' in 1973 and renamed in 1976) investigates such phenomena.\n\n==Biography==\n\nFort was born in Albany, New York in 1874,<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry. His father, a grocer, was an authoritarian and, in his unpublished autobiography ''Many Parts,'' Fort mentions the physical abuse he endured from his father. Fort's biographer, [[Damon Knight]], suggested that his distrust of authority began in his treatment as a child. Fort developed a strong sense of independence during his early years.\n\nAs a young adult, Fort wanted to be a [[natural history|naturalist]], collecting [[sea shell]]s, minerals, and birds. Although Fort was described as curious and intelligent, he was not a good student. An [[autodidact]], his considerable knowledge of the world was due mainly to his extensive personal reading.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nAt age 18, Fort left New York to embark on a world tour to \"put some capital in the bank of experience\". He travelled through the western United States, Scotland, and England, until becoming ill in Southern Africa. When he returned home, he was nursed by Anna Filing, whom he had known since childhood. They were married on October 26, 1896. Anna, four years older than Fort, was non-literary, a lover of movies and of parakeets. His success as a short story writer was intermittent between periods of poverty and [[clinical depression|melancholia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Career as a full-time writer===\n\nHis uncle died in 1916,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and a modest inheritance gave Fort enough money to quit his various [[day job]]s and to write full-time.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\">{{Cite book|author=Bill Bradbury|title=Tiedon rajamailla|trans-title=Into the Unknown|date=1982|language=Finnish|publisher=[[Reader's Digest]]|isbn=978-951-9078-89-2}}</ref> In 1917, Fort's brother Clarence died; his portion of the same inheritance was divided between Fort and Raymond.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFort's experience as a journalist,<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> coupled with his wit and contrarian nature, prepared him for his real-life work, ridiculing the pretensions of scientific [[logical positivism|positivism]] and the tendency of journalists and editors of newspapers and [[scientific journal]]s to rationalize.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFort wrote ten novels, although only one, ''[[The Outcast Manufacturers]]'' (1909), a tenement tale, was published. Reviews were mostly positive, but it was unsuccessful commercially. During 1915, Fort began to write two books, titled ''X'' and ''Y'', the first dealing with the idea that beings on [[Mars]] were controlling events on Earth, and the second with the postulation of a sinister civilization extant at the South Pole. These books caught the attention of writer [[Theodore Dreiser]], who tried to get them published, but to no avail. Discouraged, Fort burnt the manuscripts, but soon began work on the book that would change the course of his life, ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' (1919), which Dreiser helped to get published. The title referred to \"damned\" data that Fort collected, phenomena for which science could not account and that was thus rejected or ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFort and Anna lived in London from 1924 to 1926, having relocated there so Fort could peruse the files of the [[British Museum]].<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/><ref>https://stutteringhand.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/charles-fort/</ref> Although born in Albany, Fort lived most of his life in the Bronx. He was, like his wife, fond of movies, and would often take her from their Ryer Avenue apartment to a movie theater nearby, stopping at an adjacent newsstand for an armful of various newspapers. Fort frequented the parks near the Bronx, where he would sift through piles of clippings. He would often ride the subway down to the main Public Library on Fifth Avenue, where he would spend many hours reading scientific journals, newspapers, and periodicals from around the world. Fort also had literary friends who would gather at various apartments, including his own, to drink and talk.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Death===\n\nSuffering from poor health and failing eyesight, Fort was pleasantly surprised to find himself the subject of a [[cult following]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} There was talk of the formation of a formal organization to study the type of odd events related by his books. Clark writes, \"Fort himself, who did nothing to encourage any of this, found the idea hilarious. Yet he faithfully corresponded with his readers, some of whom had taken to investigating reports of anomalous phenomena and sending their findings to Fort\" (Clark 1998, 235). Fort distrusted doctors and did not seek medical help for his worsening health. Rather, he emphasized completing ''Wild Talents''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfter he collapsed on May 3, 1932, Fort was rushed to [[Royal Hospital, The Bronx|Royal Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]]. Later that same day, Fort's publisher visited him to show him the advance copies of ''Wild Talents''. Fort died only hours afterward, probably of [[leukemia]].<ref>[http://www.forteana.org/html/fortbiog.html \"Charles Fort: His Life and Times\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408071240/http://www.forteana.org/html/fortbiog.html |date=April 8, 2007 }} by Bob Rickard; 1995, revised 1997. Retrieved March 9, 2007</ref> He was interred in the Fort family plot in Albany, New York. His more than 60,000 notes were donated to the [[New York Public Library]].<ref name=\"NYPL-Thayer/Fort\">{{cite web |title=Tiffany Thayer papers.

In his short story \"The Giant, the Insect and The Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman\" (first published by the [[International Fortean Organization]] in issue No. 70 of the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown''), Fort spoke of sitting on a park bench at [[The Cloisters]] in New York City and tossing some 48,000 notes, not all of his collection by any means, into the wind.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Giant, the Insect, and the Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman\" by Charles Hoy Fort|url=http://www.resologist.net/story29.htm|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref> The notes were kept on cards and scraps of paper in shoeboxes, in a cramped [[shorthand]] of Fort's own invention, and some of them survive in the collections of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. More than once, depressed and discouraged, Fort destroyed his work, but began anew. Some notes were published by the [[Fortean Society]] magazine ''Doubt'' and, upon the death of its editor [[Tiffany Thayer]] in 1959 most were donated to the New York Public Library, where they are still available to researchers of the unknown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archives and manuscripts Fort, Charles, 1874\u20131932|url=http://archives.nypl.org/controlaccess/13206?term=Fort,%20Charles,%201874-1932}}</ref>\n\nFrom this research, Fort wrote four books. These are: ''The Book of the Damned'' (1919), ''[[New Lands]]'' (1923), ''[[Lo!]]'' (1931) and ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932); one book was written between ''New Lands'' and ''Lo!'' but it was abandoned and absorbed into ''Lo!.''\n\n===Fort's writing style===\nFort suggested that there is a [[Super-Sargasso Sea]] into which all lost things go,<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> and justified his theories by noting that they fit the data as well as the conventional explanations. As to whether Fort ''believed'' this theory, or any of his other proposals, he himself noted, \"I believe nothing of my own that I have ever written.\"\n\nNotable literary contemporaries of Fort openly admired his writing style and befriended him. Among these were: [[Ben Hecht]], [[John Cowper Powys]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Clarence Darrow]], and [[Booth Tarkington]].\n\nAfter Fort's death, the writer [[Colin Wilson]] said that he suspected that Fort took few if any of his \"explanations\" seriously and noted that Fort made \"no attempt to present a coherent argument.\" He described Fort as \"a patron saint of cranks\",<ref>[[Colin Wilson|Wilson, Colin]], ''Mysteries'', Putnam ({{ISBN|0-399-12246-X}}), p.199.</ref> while at the same time he compared Fort to [[Robert Ripley]], a popular contemporary [[cartoonist]] and writer who found major success publishing similar oddities in a syndicated newspaper panel series named ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''\n\nWilson called Fort's writing style \"atrocious\" and \"almost unreadable\", yet despite his objections to Fort's prose, he allowed that \"the facts are certainly astonishing enough.\" In the end, Fort's work gave him \"the feeling that no matter how honest scientists ''think'' they are, they are still influenced by various ''unconscious'' assumptions that prevent them from attaining true objectivity. Expressed in a sentence, Fort's principle goes something like this: People with a psychological need to ''believe'' in marvels are no more prejudiced and gullible than people with a psychological need ''not'' to believe in marvels.\"<ref>Wilson, Colin: ''ibid.'', p.201 (emphases not added).</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Jerome Clark]] wrote that Fort was \"essentially a [[Satire|satirist]] hugely [[skeptical]] of human beings'&nbsp;\u2013 especially scientists'&nbsp;\u2013 claims to ultimate knowledge.\"<ref>[[Jerome Clark|Clark, Jerome]]: \"The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis in the Early UFO Age\" in ''UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge'', edited David M. Jacobs, University Press of Kansas: 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}}), p.123. See [[Pyrrhonism]] for a similar type of skepticism.</ref> Clark described Fort's writing style as a \"distinctive blend of mocking humor, penetrating insight, and calculated outrageousness.\"<ref>Clark, Jerome: ''The UFO Book'', Visible Ink: 1998, p.200.</ref> Fort was skeptical of sciences and wrote his own mocking explanations to defy scientists who used traditional methods.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/>\n\n===Fortean phenomena===\n\nExamples of the odd phenomena in Fort's books include many occurrences of the sort variously referred to as [[occult]], [[supernatural]], and [[paranormal]]. Reported events include [[teleportation]] (a term Fort is generally credited with inventing),<ref>\"Mostly in this book I shall specialize upon indications that there exists a transportory force that I shall call Teleportation.\" in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/fort/lo/lo02.htm Fort. C. ''Lo!''] at Sacred Texts.com. Retrieved January 4, 2009</ref><ref>\"less well-known is the fact that Charles Fort coined the word in 1931\" in Rickard, B. and Michell, J. ''Unexplained Phenomena: a Rough Guide special'' (Rough Guides, 2000 ({{ISBN|1-85828-589-5}}), p.3)</ref> [[Raining animals|falls of frogs, fishes, and inorganic materials]],<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> [[spontaneous human combustion]],<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> [[ball lightning]]<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> (a term explicitly used by Fort), [[poltergeist]] events, [[List of unexplained sounds|unaccountable noises]] and explosions, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], [[unidentified flying object]]s, [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously|unexplained disappearances]], [[Unidentified submerged object|giant wheels of light in the oceans]], and animals found outside their normal ranges (see [[phantom cat]]). <!--Fort does not seem to have mentioned crop circles in his works, see http://www33.brinkster.com/cropcircles/askpoppy.html--> He offered many reports of [[out-of-place artifact]]s (OOPArts), strange items found in unlikely locations. He was also perhaps the first person to explain strange human appearances and disappearances by the hypothesis of [[alien abduction]] and was an early proponent of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]], specifically suggesting that strange lights or objects sighted in the skies might be alien spacecraft.\n\n===Forteans===\nFort's work has inspired some people to consider themselves \"Forteans.\" The first of these was the screenwriter Ben Hecht, who in a review of ''The Book of the Damned'', declared, \"I am the first disciple of Charles Fort\u2026 henceforth, I am a Fortean.\" Among Fort's other notable fans were [[John Cowper Powys]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Clarence Darrow]], and [[Booth Tarkington]], who wrote the foreword to ''New Lands''.\n\nPrecisely what is encompassed by the term \"Fortean\" is a matter of great debate; the term is widely applied to people ranging from Fortean purists dedicated to Fort's methods and interests, to those with open and active acceptance of the actuality of paranormal phenomena, a belief with which Fort may not have agreed. Most generally, Forteans have a wide interest in unexplained phenomena, concerned mostly with the natural world, and have a developed \"agnostic [[scepticism]]\" regarding the anomalies they note and discuss. For Hecht, as an example, being a Fortean meant hallowing a pronounced distrust of authority in all its forms, whether religious, scientific, political, philosophical, or otherwise. It did not, of course, include an actual belief in the anomalous data enumerated in Fort's works.\n\nThe Fortean Society was initiated at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York City on January 26, 1931, by some of Fort's friends, including such significant writers as Hecht, [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Alexander Woollcott]], and organized by fellow American writer [[Tiffany Thayer]], half in earnest and half in the spirit of great good humor, like the works of Fort himself. The board of founders included Dreiser, Hecht, Tarkington, Powys, [[Aaron Sussman]], former ''Puck'' editor [[Harry Leon Wilson]], Woollcott and [[J. David Stern]], publisher of ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]''. Active members of the Fortean Society included prominent science-fiction writers such as [[Eric Frank Russell]] and [[Damon Knight]]. Fort, however, rejected the Society and refused the presidency, which went to his friend Dreiser; he was lured to its inaugural meeting by false [[telegram]]s. As a strict non-authoritarian, Fort refused to establish himself as an authority, and further objected on the grounds that those who would be attracted by such a group would be spiritualists, zealots, and those opposed to a science that rejected them; it would attract those who ''believed'' in their chosen phenomena: an attitude exactly contrary to Forteanism. Fort did hold unofficial meetings and had a long history of getting together informally with many of New York City's literati such as Dreiser and Hecht at their apartments where they would talk, have a meal and then listen to brief reports.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe magazine ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (first published in November 1973), is a proponent of Fortean journalism, combining humour, scepticism, and serious research into subjects which scientists and other respectable authorities often disdain. Another such group is the International Fortean Organization (INFO). INFO was formed during the early 1960s (incorporated in 1965) by brothers, the writers Ron and Paul Willis, who acquired much of the material of the Fortean Society, which had largely ceased by 1959 with the death of Tiffany Thayer. INFO publishes the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown'' and organizes the FortFest, the world's first continuously running conference on anomalous phenomena dedicated to the spirit of Charles Fort. INFO, since the mid-1960s, also provides audio CDs and filmed DVDs of notable conference speakers, including [[Colin Wilson]], [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]], [[Graham Hancock]], [[John Anthony West]], [[William Corliss]], [[John Keel]], and [[Joscelyn Godwin]]. Other notable Fortean societies include the [[London Fortean Society]], [[Edinburgh Fortean Society]] in Edinburgh and the [[Isle of Wight]].\n\n===Scholarly evaluation===\nFort is acknowledged by religious scholars such as [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]] and Joseph P. Laycock as a pioneering theorist of the paranormal who helped define \"paranormal\" as a discursive category and provided insight into its importance in human experience. Although Fort is consistently critical of the scientific study of abnormal phenomena, he remains relevant today for those who engage in such studies.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laycock|first1=Joseph|title=Approaching the Paranormal|journal=Nova Religio|volume=18|issue=1|pages=5\u201315|jstor=10.1525/nr.2014.18.1.5|doi=10.1525/nr.2014.18.1.5|year=2014}}</ref><ref>Bester, Alfred. The Stars My Destination, p.5; Orion Books; 1956.</ref>\n\n==Literary influence==\nMore than a few modern authors of fiction and non-fiction who have written about the influence of Fort are sincere devotees of Fort. One of the most notable is British philosopher John Michell who wrote the Introduction to ''Lo!'', published by John Brown in 1996. Michell says: \"Fort, of course, made no attempt at defining a world-view, but the evidence he uncovered gave him an 'acceptance' of reality as something far more magical and subtly organized than is considered proper today.\" [[Stephen King]] also uses the works of Fort to illuminate his main characters, notably ''It'' and ''Firestarter''. In ''Firestarter'', the parents of a [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetically]] gifted child are advised to read Fort's ''Wild Talents'' rather than the works of baby doctor [[Benjamin Spock]]. [[Loren Coleman]] is a well-known cryptozoologist, author of ''The Unidentified'' (1975) dedicated to Fort, and ''Mysterious America'', which ''Fortean Times'' termed a Fortean classic. Indeed, Coleman terms himself the first Vietnam era conscientious objector to base his pacificist ideas on Fortean thoughts. Jerome Clark has described himself as a \"sceptical Fortean\".<ref name=\"Magonia\">[http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/80/confessions.htm Confessions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224231216/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/80/confessions.htm |date=February 24, 2007 }}.</ref> [[Mike Dash]] is another capable Fortean, bringing his historian's training to bear on all manner of odd reports, while being careful to avoid uncritically accepting ''any'' orthodoxy, be it that of fringe devotees or mainstream science. Science-fiction writers of note including [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] were also fans of the work of Fort. [[Alfred Bester]]'s teleportation-themed novel, 'The Stars My Destination', pays homage to the coiner of the term by naming the first teleporter, 'Charles Fort Jaunte.'  Fort's work, of compilation and commentary on anomalous phenomena has been carried on by [[William R. Corliss]], whose self-published books and notes bring Fort's collections up to date.\n\nIn 1939 [[Eric Frank Russell]] first published the novel which became ''[[Sinister Barrier]]'', in which he names Fort explicitly as an influence. Russell included some of Fort's data in the story.<ref>Russell, Eric Frank, ''Sinister Barrier'', Paperback Library, New York, 1966</ref> [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], Scottish naturalist and writer, was a devotee of Fort's work, and referenced it heavily in several of his own books on unexplained phenomena, notably ''Things'' (1967), and ''More Things'' (1969). [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]]'s ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' was also heavily influenced by Fort's work and mentions it often. Author Donald Jeffries referenced Charles Fort repeatedly in his 2007 novel ''The Unreals''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}Joe Milutis writes a short chapter in his book ''Failure, a Writer's Life'' on Charles Fort, characterising Fort's prose as \"well-nigh unreadable, yet strangely exhilarating\".<ref>Milutis, J.

Fortean author Loren Coleman has written a chapter about this motion picture, entitled \"The Teleporting Animals and ''Magnolia''\", in one of his recent books. The film has many hidden Fortean themes, notably \"falling frogs\". In one scene, one of Fort's books is visible on a table in a library and there is an end credit thanking him by name.<ref name=\"coleman\">{{cite news | last = Coleman | first = Loren | title = Mysterious America: The Ultimate Guide to the Nation's Weirdest Wonders, Strangest Spots, and Creepiest Creatures | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> In the 2011 film ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness (film)|The Whisperer in Darkness]]'', Fort is portrayed by [[Andrew Leman (actor)|Andrew Leman]].\n\nAmerican crime and science fiction author [[Fredric Brown]] included an excerpt from Fort's book ''Wild Talents'' at the beginning of his novel ''Compliments of a Fiend''.

The terms ''Fortean'' and ''Forteana'' are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena. Fort's books sold well and are still in print.  His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as \"Forteans\", and has influenced some aspects of science fiction.\n\nFort's collections of scientific anomalies, including ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' (1919), influenced numerous science fiction writers with their iconoclastic [[skepticism]] and as sources of ideas. \"Fortean\" phenomena are events which seem to challenge the boundaries of accepted scientific knowledge, and the ''Fortean Times'' (founded as ''The News'' in 1973 and renamed in 1976) investigates such phenomena.\n\n==Biography==\n\nFort was born in Albany, New York in 1874,<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry. His father, a grocer, was an authoritarian and, in his unpublished autobiography ''Many Parts,'' Fort mentions the physical abuse he endured from his father. Fort's biographer, [[Damon Knight]], suggested that his distrust of authority began in his treatment as a child. Fort developed a strong sense of independence during his early years.\n\nAs a young adult, Fort wanted to be a [[natural history|naturalist]], collecting [[sea shell]]s, minerals, and birds. Although Fort was described as curious and intelligent, he was not a good student. An [[autodidact]], his considerable knowledge of the world was due mainly to his extensive personal reading.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nAt age 18, Fort left New York to embark on a world tour to \"put some capital in the bank of experience\". He travelled through the western United States, Scotland, and England, until becoming ill in Southern Africa. When he returned home, he was nursed by Anna Filing, whom he had known since childhood. They were married on October 26, 1896. Anna, four years older than Fort, was non-literary, a lover of movies and of parakeets. His success as a short story writer was intermittent between periods of poverty and [[clinical depression|melancholia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Career as a full-time writer===\n\nHis uncle died in 1916,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and a modest inheritance gave Fort enough money to quit his various [[day job]]s and to write full-time.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\">{{Cite book|author=Bill Bradbury|title=Tiedon rajamailla|trans-title=Into the Unknown|date=1982|language=Finnish|publisher=[[Reader's Digest]]|isbn=978-951-9078-89-2}}</ref> In 1917, Fort's brother Clarence died; his portion of the same inheritance was divided between Fort and Raymond.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFort's experience as a journalist,<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> coupled with his wit and contrarian nature, prepared him for his real-life work, ridiculing the pretensions of scientific [[logical positivism|positivism]] and the tendency of journalists and editors of newspapers and [[scientific journal]]s to rationalize.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFort wrote ten novels, although only one, ''[[The Outcast Manufacturers]]'' (1909), a tenement tale, was published. Reviews were mostly positive, but it was unsuccessful commercially. During 1915, Fort began to write two books, titled ''X'' and ''Y'', the first dealing with the idea that beings on [[Mars]] were controlling events on Earth, and the second with the postulation of a sinister civilization extant at the South Pole. These books caught the attention of writer [[Theodore Dreiser]], who tried to get them published, but to no avail. Discouraged, Fort burnt the manuscripts, but soon began work on the book that would change the course of his life, ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' (1919), which Dreiser helped to get published. The title referred to \"damned\" data that Fort collected, phenomena for which science could not account and that was thus rejected or ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFort and Anna lived in London from 1924 to 1926, having relocated there so Fort could peruse the files of the [[British Museum]].<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/><ref>https://stutteringhand.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/charles-fort/</ref> Although born in Albany, Fort lived most of his life in the Bronx. He was, like his wife, fond of movies, and would often take her from their Ryer Avenue apartment to a movie theater nearby, stopping at an adjacent newsstand for an armful of various newspapers. Fort frequented the parks near the Bronx, where he would sift through piles of clippings. He would often ride the subway down to the main Public Library on Fifth Avenue, where he would spend many hours reading scientific journals, newspapers, and periodicals from around the world. Fort also had literary friends who would gather at various apartments, including his own, to drink and talk.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Death===\n\nSuffering from poor health and failing eyesight, Fort was pleasantly surprised to find himself the subject of a [[cult following]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} There was talk of the formation of a formal organization to study the type of odd events related by his books. Clark writes, \"Fort himself, who did nothing to encourage any of this, found the idea hilarious. Yet he faithfully corresponded with his readers, some of whom had taken to investigating reports of anomalous phenomena and sending their findings to Fort\" (Clark 1998, 235). Fort distrusted doctors and did not seek medical help for his worsening health. Rather, he emphasized completing ''Wild Talents''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfter he collapsed on May 3, 1932, Fort was rushed to [[Royal Hospital, The Bronx|Royal Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]]. Later that same day, Fort's publisher visited him to show him the advance copies of ''Wild Talents''. Fort died only hours afterward, probably of [[leukemia]].<ref>[http://www.forteana.org/html/fortbiog.html \"Charles Fort: His Life and Times\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408071240/http://www.forteana.org/html/fortbiog.html |date=April 8, 2007 }} by Bob Rickard; 1995, revised 1997. Retrieved March 9, 2007</ref> He was interred in the Fort family plot in Albany, New York. His more than 60,000 notes were donated to the [[New York Public Library]].<ref name=\"NYPL-Thayer/Fort\">{{cite web |title=Tiffany Thayer papers.

In his short story \"The Giant, the Insect and The Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman\" (first published by the [[International Fortean Organization]] in issue No. 70 of the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown''), Fort spoke of sitting on a park bench at [[The Cloisters]] in New York City and tossing some 48,000 notes, not all of his collection by any means, into the wind.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Giant, the Insect, and the Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman\" by Charles Hoy Fort|url=http://www.resologist.net/story29.htm|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref> The notes were kept on cards and scraps of paper in shoeboxes, in a cramped [[shorthand]] of Fort's own invention, and some of them survive in the collections of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. More than once, depressed and discouraged, Fort destroyed his work, but began anew. Some notes were published by the [[Fortean Society]] magazine ''Doubt'' and, upon the death of its editor [[Tiffany Thayer]] in 1959 most were donated to the New York Public Library, where they are still available to researchers of the unknown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archives and manuscripts Fort, Charles, 1874\u20131932|url=http://archives.nypl.org/controlaccess/13206?term=Fort,%20Charles,%201874-1932}}</ref>\n\nFrom this research, Fort wrote four books. These are: ''The Book of the Damned'' (1919), ''[[New Lands]]'' (1923), ''[[Lo!]]'' (1931) and ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932); one book was written between ''New Lands'' and ''Lo!'' but it was abandoned and absorbed into ''Lo!.''\n\n===Fort's writing style===\nFort suggested that there is a [[Super-Sargasso Sea]] into which all lost things go,<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> and justified his theories by noting that they fit the data as well as the conventional explanations. As to whether Fort ''believed'' this theory, or any of his other proposals, he himself noted, \"I believe nothing of my own that I have ever written.\"\n\nNotable literary contemporaries of Fort openly admired his writing style and befriended him. Among these were: [[Ben Hecht]], [[John Cowper Powys]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Clarence Darrow]], and [[Booth Tarkington]].\n\nAfter Fort's death, the writer [[Colin Wilson]] said that he suspected that Fort took few if any of his \"explanations\" seriously and noted that Fort made \"no attempt to present a coherent argument.\" He described Fort as \"a patron saint of cranks\",<ref>[[Colin Wilson|Wilson, Colin]], ''Mysteries'', Putnam ({{ISBN|0-399-12246-X}}), p.199.</ref> while at the same time he compared Fort to [[Robert Ripley]], a popular contemporary [[cartoonist]] and writer who found major success publishing similar oddities in a syndicated newspaper panel series named ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''\n\nWilson called Fort's writing style \"atrocious\" and \"almost unreadable\", yet despite his objections to Fort's prose, he allowed that \"the facts are certainly astonishing enough.\" In the end, Fort's work gave him \"the feeling that no matter how honest scientists ''think'' they are, they are still influenced by various ''unconscious'' assumptions that prevent them from attaining true objectivity. Expressed in a sentence, Fort's principle goes something like this: People with a psychological need to ''believe'' in marvels are no more prejudiced and gullible than people with a psychological need ''not'' to believe in marvels.\"<ref>Wilson, Colin: ''ibid.'', p.201 (emphases not added).</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Jerome Clark]] wrote that Fort was \"essentially a [[Satire|satirist]] hugely [[skeptical]] of human beings'&nbsp;\u2013 especially scientists'&nbsp;\u2013 claims to ultimate knowledge.\"<ref>[[Jerome Clark|Clark, Jerome]]: \"The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis in the Early UFO Age\" in ''UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge'', edited David M. Jacobs, University Press of Kansas: 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}}), p.123. See [[Pyrrhonism]] for a similar type of skepticism.</ref> Clark described Fort's writing style as a \"distinctive blend of mocking humor, penetrating insight, and calculated outrageousness.\"<ref>Clark, Jerome: ''The UFO Book'', Visible Ink: 1998, p.200.</ref> Fort was skeptical of sciences and wrote his own mocking explanations to defy scientists who used traditional methods.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/>\n\n===Fortean phenomena===\n\nExamples of the odd phenomena in Fort's books include many occurrences of the sort variously referred to as [[occult]], [[supernatural]], and [[paranormal]]. Reported events include [[teleportation]] (a term Fort is generally credited with inventing),<ref>\"Mostly in this book I shall specialize upon indications that there exists a transportory force that I shall call Teleportation.\" in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/fort/lo/lo02.htm Fort. C. ''Lo!''] at Sacred Texts.com. Retrieved January 4, 2009</ref><ref>\"less well-known is the fact that Charles Fort coined the word in 1931\" in Rickard, B. and Michell, J. ''Unexplained Phenomena: a Rough Guide special'' (Rough Guides, 2000 ({{ISBN|1-85828-589-5}}), p.3)</ref> [[Raining animals|falls of frogs, fishes, and inorganic materials]],<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> [[spontaneous human combustion]],<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> [[ball lightning]]<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> (a term explicitly used by Fort), [[poltergeist]] events, [[List of unexplained sounds|unaccountable noises]] and explosions, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], [[unidentified flying object]]s, [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously|unexplained disappearances]], [[Unidentified submerged object|giant wheels of light in the oceans]], and animals found outside their normal ranges (see [[phantom cat]]). <!--Fort does not seem to have mentioned crop circles in his works, see http://www33.brinkster.com/cropcircles/askpoppy.html--> He offered many reports of [[out-of-place artifact]]s (OOPArts), strange items found in unlikely locations. He was also perhaps the first person to explain strange human appearances and disappearances by the hypothesis of [[alien abduction]] and was an early proponent of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]], specifically suggesting that strange lights or objects sighted in the skies might be alien spacecraft.\n\n===Forteans===\nFort's work has inspired some people to consider themselves \"Forteans.\" The first of these was the screenwriter Ben Hecht, who in a review of ''The Book of the Damned'', declared, \"I am the first disciple of Charles Fort\u2026 henceforth, I am a Fortean.\" Among Fort's other notable fans were [[John Cowper Powys]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Clarence Darrow]], and [[Booth Tarkington]], who wrote the foreword to ''New Lands''.\n\nPrecisely what is encompassed by the term \"Fortean\" is a matter of great debate; the term is widely applied to people ranging from Fortean purists dedicated to Fort's methods and interests, to those with open and active acceptance of the actuality of paranormal phenomena, a belief with which Fort may not have agreed. Most generally, Forteans have a wide interest in unexplained phenomena, concerned mostly with the natural world, and have a developed \"agnostic [[scepticism]]\" regarding the anomalies they note and discuss. For Hecht, as an example, being a Fortean meant hallowing a pronounced distrust of authority in all its forms, whether religious, scientific, political, philosophical, or otherwise. It did not, of course, include an actual belief in the anomalous data enumerated in Fort's works.\n\nThe Fortean Society was initiated at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York City on January 26, 1931, by some of Fort's friends, including such significant writers as Hecht, [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Alexander Woollcott]], and organized by fellow American writer [[Tiffany Thayer]], half in earnest and half in the spirit of great good humor, like the works of Fort himself. The board of founders included Dreiser, Hecht, Tarkington, Powys, [[Aaron Sussman]], former ''Puck'' editor [[Harry Leon Wilson]], Woollcott and [[J. David Stern]], publisher of ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]''. Active members of the Fortean Society included prominent science-fiction writers such as [[Eric Frank Russell]] and [[Damon Knight]]. Fort, however, rejected the Society and refused the presidency, which went to his friend Dreiser; he was lured to its inaugural meeting by false [[telegram]]s. As a strict non-authoritarian, Fort refused to establish himself as an authority, and further objected on the grounds that those who would be attracted by such a group would be spiritualists, zealots, and those opposed to a science that rejected them; it would attract those who ''believed'' in their chosen phenomena: an attitude exactly contrary to Forteanism. Fort did hold unofficial meetings and had a long history of getting together informally with many of New York City's literati such as Dreiser and Hecht at their apartments where they would talk, have a meal and then listen to brief reports.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe magazine ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (first published in November 1973), is a proponent of Fortean journalism, combining humour, scepticism, and serious research into subjects which scientists and other respectable authorities often disdain. Another such group is the International Fortean Organization (INFO). INFO was formed during the early 1960s (incorporated in 1965) by brothers, the writers Ron and Paul Willis, who acquired much of the material of the Fortean Society, which had largely ceased by 1959 with the death of Tiffany Thayer. INFO publishes the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown'' and organizes the FortFest, the world's first continuously running conference on anomalous phenomena dedicated to the spirit of Charles Fort. INFO, since the mid-1960s, also provides audio CDs and filmed DVDs of notable conference speakers, including [[Colin Wilson]], [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]], [[Graham Hancock]], [[John Anthony West]], [[William Corliss]], [[John Keel]], and [[Joscelyn Godwin]]. Other notable Fortean societies include the [[London Fortean Society]], [[Edinburgh Fortean Society]] in Edinburgh and the [[Isle of Wight]].\n\n===Scholarly evaluation===\nFort is acknowledged by religious scholars such as [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]] and Joseph P. Laycock as a pioneering theorist of the paranormal who helped define \"paranormal\" as a discursive category and provided insight into its importance in human experience. Although Fort is consistently critical of the scientific study of abnormal phenomena, he remains relevant today for those who engage in such studies.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laycock|first1=Joseph|title=Approaching the Paranormal|journal=Nova Religio|volume=18|issue=1|pages=5\u201315|jstor=10.1525/nr.2014.18.1.5|doi=10.1525/nr.2014.18.1.5|year=2014}}</ref><ref>Bester, Alfred. The Stars My Destination, p.5; Orion Books; 1956.</ref>\n\n==Literary influence==\nMore than a few modern authors of fiction and non-fiction who have written about the influence of Fort are sincere devotees of Fort. One of the most notable is British philosopher John Michell who wrote the Introduction to ''Lo!'', published by John Brown in 1996. Michell says: \"Fort, of course, made no attempt at defining a world-view, but the evidence he uncovered gave him an 'acceptance' of reality as something far more magical and subtly organized than is considered proper today.\" [[Stephen King]] also uses the works of Fort to illuminate his main characters, notably ''It'' and ''Firestarter''. In ''Firestarter'', the parents of a [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetically]] gifted child are advised to read Fort's ''Wild Talents'' rather than the works of baby doctor [[Benjamin Spock]]. [[Loren Coleman]] is a well-known cryptozoologist, author of ''The Unidentified'' (1975) dedicated to Fort, and ''Mysterious America'', which ''Fortean Times'' termed a Fortean classic. Indeed, Coleman terms himself the first Vietnam era conscientious objector to base his pacificist ideas on Fortean thoughts. Jerome Clark has described himself as a \"sceptical Fortean\".<ref name=\"Magonia\">[http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/80/confessions.htm Confessions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224231216/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/80/confessions.htm |date=February 24, 2007 }}.</ref> [[Mike Dash]] is another capable Fortean, bringing his historian's training to bear on all manner of odd reports, while being careful to avoid uncritically accepting ''any'' orthodoxy, be it that of fringe devotees or mainstream science. Science-fiction writers of note including [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] were also fans of the work of Fort. [[Alfred Bester]]'s teleportation-themed novel, 'The Stars My Destination', pays homage to the coiner of the term by naming the first teleporter, 'Charles Fort Jaunte.'  Fort's work, of compilation and commentary on anomalous phenomena has been carried on by [[William R. Corliss]], whose self-published books and notes bring Fort's collections up to date.\n\nIn 1939 [[Eric Frank Russell]] first published the novel which became ''[[Sinister Barrier]]'', in which he names Fort explicitly as an influence. Russell included some of Fort's data in the story.<ref>Russell, Eric Frank, ''Sinister Barrier'', Paperback Library, New York, 1966</ref> [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], Scottish naturalist and writer, was a devotee of Fort's work, and referenced it heavily in several of his own books on unexplained phenomena, notably ''Things'' (1967), and ''More Things'' (1969). [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]]'s ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' was also heavily influenced by Fort's work and mentions it often. Author Donald Jeffries referenced Charles Fort repeatedly in his 2007 novel ''The Unreals''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe noted UK paranormalist, Fortean and ordained priest [[Lionel Fanthorpe]] presented the ''[[Fortean TV]]'' series on [[Channel 4]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s popular movie ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999) has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and '30s works of Charles Fort. Fortean author Loren Coleman has written a chapter about this motion picture, entitled \"The Teleporting Animals and ''Magnolia''\", in one of his recent books. The film has many hidden Fortean themes, notably \"falling frogs\". In one scene, one of Fort's books is visible on a table in a library and there is an end credit thanking him by name.<ref name=\"coleman\">{{cite news | last = Coleman | first = Loren | title = Mysterious America: The Ultimate Guide to the Nation's Weirdest Wonders, Strangest Spots, and Creepiest Creatures | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> In the 2011 film ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness (film)|The Whisperer in Darkness]]'', Fort is portrayed by [[Andrew Leman (actor)|Andrew Leman]].\n\nAmerican crime and science fiction author [[Fredric Brown]] included an excerpt from Fort's book ''Wild Talents'' at the beginning of his novel ''Compliments of a Fiend''. In that quote Fort speculated about the disappearance of two people named Ambrose and wondered \"was someone collecting Ambroses?\" Brown's novel concerns the disappearance of a character named Ambrose and the kidnapper calls himself the \"Ambrose collector\" as an obvious homage to Fort.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Fredric|title=Compliments of a Fiend|publisher=blackmask.com|isbn=978-1596541221|date=August 1, 2004}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFort published five books during his lifetime, including one novel.

Beginning as a television commentator with the [[BBC]] in 1971, he has commentated on over 2000 games on television and radio. From the late 1970s to 2008, Motson was the dominant football commentary figure at the BBC, apart from a brief spell in the 1990s, when his friend and rival [[Barry Davies]] was selected for two [[FA Cup]] final commentaries, the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|1994 World Cup final]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] semi-final between England and Germany.\n\nIn 2008, Motson announced his retirement from live television commentary. He continued to cover games for ''[[Match of the Day]]'' highlights and appeared on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] as well as commentating on CBeebies' ''Footy Pups''. In September 2017, he announced his full retirement from BBC commentary, having commentated on 10 [[FIFA World Cup]]s, 10 [[UEFA European Championship]]s and 29 FA Cup finals.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/05/john-motson-football-commentator-ready-to-retire | title= John Motson almost ready to hang up his sheepskin and end the boys' own story | first=Paul| last=MacInnes| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=6 September 2017 | accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref> In July 2018, he announced he was returning from retirement to work for [[Talksport]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://talksport.com/football/403213/john-motson-comes-out-of-retirement-to-join-talksport/ | title= John Motson comes out of retirement to join talkSPORT| work=[[Talksport]] | date=24 July 2018 | accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Early years ==\nThe son of a Methodist minister, Motson was born in [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]], and educated at [[Culford School]], near [[Bury St Edmunds]].

Motson was drafted in as a late replacement for [[David Coleman]], who was in a contractual dispute with the BBC.

Motson found himself commentating on a tragedy rather than a football match, and he later appeared as part of the Hillsborough inquiry, since he had been a witness.\n\nMotson was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1996 when he was surprised by [[Michael Aspel]] during a charity cheque presentation at the Bayswater Families Centre in London.\n\nMotson featured alongside [[Mark Lawrenson]] as the primary commentator in [[UEFA Euro 2000 (video game)|EA's Euro 2000 video game]].\n\nIn 2001, speech therapist Jane Comins conducted a voice profile analysis to study the patterns of eight top television and radio commentators. The criteria included [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume, rhythm and [[timbre|tone]], and Comins found that Motson scored the best results. This was backed by 32% of football fans in a survey who voted him Britain's favourite commentator.

From the late 1970s to 2008, Motson was the dominant football commentary figure at the BBC, apart from a brief spell in the 1990s, when his friend and rival [[Barry Davies]] was selected for two [[FA Cup]] final commentaries, the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|1994 World Cup final]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] semi-final between England and Germany.\n\nIn 2008, Motson announced his retirement from live television commentary. He continued to cover games for ''[[Match of the Day]]'' highlights and appeared on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] as well as commentating on CBeebies' ''Footy Pups''.

Founded in 1877 in [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], an inner-western suburb of [[Melbourne]], the club won nine premierships in the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) before gaining entry to the Victorian Football League (since renamed the AFL) in 1925. The club has won two VFL/AFL premierships, in [[1954 VFL Grand Final|1954]] and [[2016 AFL Grand Final|2016]], and was runner up in [[1961 VFL Grand Final|1961]]. It has also claimed one premiership in the [[AFL Women's]] competition, in [[2018 AFL Women's Grand Final|2018]], having been a foundation member of the league the previous year.\n\nThe Western Bulldogs' home [[Guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]] features two thick horizontal hoops\u2014one red and one white\u2014on a royal blue background.\n\nThe club's headquarters and training facilities are located in Footscray at [[Whitten Oval]], nicknamed \"The Kennel\", its original home ground. The club draws much of its supporter base from Melbourne's traditionally working class western region, and plays its home matches at [[Docklands Stadium]] (currently known as Marvel Stadium) in the [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] area, also in the city's inner-west. In 1996, the club changed its name from the \"Footscray Football Club\" to the \"Western Bulldogs\".{{why|date=February 2020}} As well as their participation in AFL and AFLW, the club also fields reserves sides in the [[Victorian Football League]] and [[VFL Women's]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1877\u20131924: Origins, VFA years and Championship of Victoria===\n[[File:Footscray team 1898.jpg|thumb|right|The team that won the first premiership for the club in 1898]]\n[[File:Con McCarthy 1923.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Footscray captain [[Con McCarthy]] led the club to VFA premierships in 1923 and 1924, as well as the 1924 Championship of Victoria to gain entry into the VFL.]]\nNewspapers record Australian rules football being played in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] in the mid-1870s, during which time a local junior football club was formed. In 1880, the club changed its name to the Prince Imperials in honour of [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]], the heir to [[List of French monarchs|French throne]], who had recently died in battle. The club reverted to Footscray a few years later. In 1886, Footscray gained admission to the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) after amalgamating with the Footscray Cricket Club to form a senior football club. The club tended to struggle over the next decade, occupying the lower rungs of the VFA ladder.\n\nThe club began to improve after the [[Victorian Football League#Split|VFL breakaway of 1896]], finishing on top of the VFA ladder in 1898, 1899 and 1900. As no finals were played, Footscray were declared premiers. The club played in and won its first finals match in 1903, against {{AFL Ric}}, the minor premiers, but lost the follow-up finals match to {{AFL NM}}. After losing to [[West Melbourne Football Club|West Melbourne]] in the 1906 VFA Grand Final, the club won its first premiership by defeating [[Brunswick Football Club|Brunswick]] in 1908. Another premiership followed in 1913.\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match|1924 Championship of Victoria]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[File:AFL Footscray Icon.jpg|16px]] Footscray || '''9''' || '''10''' || '''64'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |[[File:EssendonDesign.svg|16px]] {{AFL Ess}} || 4 || 12 || 36\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 46,100\n|}\nThe club entered two years of recess during World War I and returned in 1918. Still rebuilding, the club won the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]]. From bottom to top in one year, 1919 saw the club win the premiership, and again in 1920. The club went back-to-back in 1923 and 1924.\n\nThe 1924 premiership would be Footscray's last in the VFA. After the 1924 season, the club challenged the premiers of the VFL, [[Essendon Bombers|Essendon]], to a charity match, otherwise known as the [[Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match|Championship of Victoria]], for the benefit of opera singer Dame [[Nellie Melba]]'s Limbless Soldiers' Appeal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Did the 1924 Bombers throw their last game?|url=http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977|work=AFL|publisher=Telstra Corporation Limited|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Lionel Frost|date=25 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090710013417/http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977|archivedate= 10 July 2009 }}</ref> Footscray recorded an upset victory, winning by 28 points. The win was a significant factor in Footscray gaining admission to the VFL.\n\n===1925\u20131940s: Joining the VFL===\nIn 1919, there were nine clubs competing in the VFL, due to the return of all the foundation teams plus Richmond after World War I, as well as [[University Football Club]] deciding not to rejoin the VFL. This caused one team to be idle every Saturday and the VFL was keen to do away with this bye each week. On the night of 9 January 1925, a committee meeting of the VFL, chaired by Reg Hunt of [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], decided to expand the league from nine clubs to twelve. It was decided in the meeting to admit Footscray, along with two other VFA clubs, {{AFL Haw}} and {{AFL NM}}.\n\nFootscray played their first VFL match against {{AFL Fit}} on Saturday 2 May at the [[Brunswick Street Oval]] in front of 28,000 spectators. Former {{AFL Ric}} star [[George Bayliss]] had the honour of kicking Footscray's first VFL goal, and although they ended up losing by nine points against an experienced league side, they earned great respect. Future Brownlow medallist [[Allan Hopkins]] was regarded as Footscray's best player that day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2113637 |title=Saturday's Results. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=24,566 |location=Melbourne|date=4 May 1925 |accessdate=8 February 2017 |page=9 }}</ref> The following week, playing their first VFL home game at the [[Whitten Oval|Western Oval]] against a strong {{AFL SM}} team, the Tricolours recorded their first VFL victory by 10 points in front of 25,000 spectators with a strong team effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2115597 |title=FOOTSCRAY'S FINE VICTORY. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=24,572 |location=Melbourne|date=11 May 1925 |accessdate=8 February 2017 |page=17 }}</ref>\n\nFootscray adapted relatively quickly to the standard of VFL football despite losing some of their VFA stars, and by 1928 were already a contender for the finals, missing only on percentage in 1931. Though they slipped to eleventh place in 1930, 1935 and 1937, in 1938 they became the first of the new clubs to reach the finals. They fell back drastically in 1939, but played better during the war-torn 1940s, winning their first nine games in 1946.\n\n===1950\u20131954: E. J.

In [[1953 VFL season|1953]], however, the club set a record by conceding only 959 points in the home-and-away season due to a powerful defence featuring Whitten, [[Dave Bryden]], [[Wally Donald]], [[Herb Henderson]] and [[Jim Gallagher (footballer)|Jim Gallagher]].

J.\" or \"Mr Football\", one of Australian rules football's best ever players. Sutton claims to have invented the modern play-on style of football \u2013 run, handball, run, kick. Whitten was famous for his inventive and lightning-fast ''flick pass'', which was banned due to the umpire's difficulty in distinguishing whether the ball was thrown, or hit with the open hand.\n\n===1955\u20131960s: Gradual decline===\nFootscray failed to capitalise on their premiership success, falling off in the latter part of the decade and finishing with their first [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in 1959.\n\nThe 1960s started promisingly, with the club bouncing back to reach the [[1961 VFL Grand Final|1961 Grand Final]], where they faced {{AFL Haw}} who were in their first Grand Final. This was the first VFL Grand Final not to feature any of the foundation teams. In front of over 107,000 spectators, the Bulldogs worked their way to an eight-point lead at half-time, but were clearly struggling with the physicality of their hardened opponents. Rover [[Merv Hobbs]] recalled eight players needing first aid, while ruckman [[John Schultz (footballer, born 1938)|John Schultz]] remembered: ''The selectors looked around and could see we were in a bad way. In those days, strange to realise, we didn't hydrate. We were told not to drink too much in case we got cramps. We just ran out of legs. And Hawthorn were brutal. They made every contest a physical clash. They wore us down.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-finals-new-dogs-pulling-off-old-tricks-at-footscray-20160921-grl8yc.html|title=AFL finals: New Dogs pulling off old tricks at Footscray|first=Greg|last=Baum|work=The Age|date=23 September 2016}}</ref> In the second half, the Hawks, led by centreman [[Brendan Edwards]], pulled away from the tiring Bulldogs, kicking ten goals to two to take out their first VFL premiership. This was followed by winning the 1963 and 1964 night premierships, although this success was not transferred into the season proper. The rest of the decade was a bleak era for the club, particularly between 1965 and 1969, when they finished in the bottom three every year.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Ted Whitten statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Footscray legend E. J. Whitten played his 321st and final game in 1970 to become the [[List of VFL/AFL players to have played 300 games#Games record holder|VFL games record holder]]. (Pictured: Statue of Whitten outside Whitten Oval.)]]\nTed Whitten Snr. retired as a player in 1970 and held the record for the most VFL games played at the time (321 games); he would continue in a coaching capacity until the end of 1971. The club was relatively strong in the 1970s, but did not win a final; by decade's end they were back near the bottom.\n\nThe main stars of the decade included [[Gary Dempsey (Australian footballer)|Gary Dempsey]], the heroic [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]] who was badly burnt in Lara bushfire of January 1969 but managed to take out the game's top individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1975. Promising South Australian import [[Neil Sachse]] had his neck broken in a freak accident while playing against Fitzroy at the Western Oval. He was left [[quadriplegic]].\nIn 1978, [[Kelvin Templeton]] became the first Bulldogs player to kick 100 goals in a season, including a club record of 15.9 in Round 13 against St Kilda.\n\n===1980s ===\nAfter muddling its way through a disappointing decade, having to sell many of its key players to survive, the Bulldogs would endure another tumultuous decade in the 1980s. To try and improve the club's fortunes, the committee appointed former Richmond champion [[Royce Hart]] as coach for the [[1980 VFL season]]. Things hit an all-time low in [[1982 VFL season|1982]]; the Bulldogs lost their opening round match to {{AFL Ess}} by 109 points and by the middle of the season, with only one win in 12 games and having lost the last eight matches, Hart was sacked and replaced with player [[Ian Hampshire]], who promptly quit his playing duties.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Age|first=Emma|last=Quayle|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/26/1053801337712.html|date=27 May 2003|title=Stick together, say the Dogs of '82}}</ref> One of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary season was the performance of Western Australian recruit [[Simon Beasley]], who kicked 82 goals for the season and proved himself one of the best full-forwards in the competition. He would go on to become the Bulldogs' record goalkicker.\n\n[[Mick Malthouse]] was appointed senior coach in 1984, and a dramatic improvement saw them rise to second position in 1985 before a ten-point loss in the preliminary finals against Hawthorn. The club boasted a list of top players at this time, with Beasley, [[Doug Hawkins]], [[Brian Royal]], [[Rick Kennedy]], [[Stephen Wallis]], [[Peter Foster (Australian rules footballer)|Peter Foster]], [[Michael McLean (footballer)|Michael McLean]], [[Jim Edmond]], [[Andrew Purser]], [[Stephen MacPherson]] and [[Brad Hardie]].\n\nThings didn't bode well for the Bulldogs early in the [[1987 VFL season]]. Hardie and Edmond had moved to the newly formed {{AFL BB}}, while Hawkins' return from his knee injury was still some time away. By Round 3 they were sitting on the bottom of the ladder after heavy losses to Essendon, {{AFL Syd}} and {{AFL Car}}. Footscray's revival started when, in one of the upsets of the season, they defeated the reigning premiers Hawthorn by 41 points in a display characterised by teamwork and desperation.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Prenesti|title=Footscray pulls out a do-or-die victory|url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=kLNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_5IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4222%2C368103|work=The Age|date=21 April 1987|page=39}}</ref> A seven-match winning streak mid-season saw them back in the Top Five. However, they just missed out on the finals when Melbourne defeated them in the last round in front of a record crowd at their home ground.\n\n====1989: Proposed merger and fightback====\nDiscontent between players, officials and fans reached an all-time low during the [[1989 VFL season]]. Club president [[Barrie Beattie]] was replaced by former Footscray board member, businessman and prominent racing personality [[Nick Columb]] in March. Things started promisingly with a 59-point win over a dispirited Carlton at [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]], with {{WAFL Sub}} recruit [[John Georgiades]] kicking eight goals on debut.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=208pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DJcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4713%2C3210270|title=Dogs' new litter leaves Blues flat|first=Garry|last=Linnell|work=The Age|page=32|date=3 April 1989}}</ref> However, it proved to be a false dawn; the Bulldogs would only win five more games for the season, with one draw, to finish 13th. The prevailing mood was best captured in Footscray's last win of the season in Round 20 against eventual wooden-spooners {{AFL Ric}}; although the Bulldogs won by 78 points, a meagre crowd of 8,673 turned up to what many believed at the time would be Footscray's last home game at the [[Whitten Oval|Western Oval]]. [[The Age|''Age'']] journalist [[Garry Linnell]] wrote: \"But saddest of all is that the suburb of Footscray has turned its back on the Western Oval and its football team. Without that support, one of the last remaining monuments to the days when Victorian football was a battle of suburban tribes has hit the dust.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gLMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SZEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1493%2C338779|title=Apathy rules as the West gives up on the Bulldogs|first=Garry|last=Linnell|date=21 August 1989|page=36|work=The Age}}</ref>\n \nFaced with the prospect of running a club with declining membership and sponsorship, Columb learned that Footscray's debt situation was poor, and it reached the point when the VFL looked likely to appoint an [[administration (law)|administrator]] to wind up the club's affairs at the end of the year.<ref name=\"4octms1\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=72|author=Michael Stevens|date=4 October 1989|title=No choice}}</ref> He decided the best way forward was a merger with {{AFL Fit}}, which was also in a weak financial position, although was not facing immediate bankruptcy. The two clubs announced a merger to form the [[Fitzroy Bulldogs]], but the merger was derailed when the people of Footscray, led by lawyer [[Peter Gordon (lawyer)|Peter Gordon]] and a host of others, rallied to raise funds to pay off the club's debts. In further developments, former club player [[Terry Wheeler]] was named as Malthouse's replacement as senior coach, while champion veteran [[Centre line (football)|wingman]] Doug Hawkins was appointed captain.  While Columb was branded by some as the villain of the story, the wisdom of hindsight shows that had he not instigated the merger, the Western Bulldogs would not exist as it does today.<ref>{{cite web | author=Mark Stevens | title=The 20-year miracle | date=4 September 2009 | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/the-20-year-miracle/story-e6frf9nx-1225769336965}}</ref><ref>''Unleashed \u2013 A History of the Footscray Football Club''</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nThe Bulldogs began the new decade in promising fashion, finishing in seventh place with twelve wins in 1990, including one against eventual premiers Collingwood, when [[Follower (Australian rules football)|rover]] [[Steven Kolyniuk]] ran around the man on the mark and kicked a goal to put his team in front. Although they just missed out on the finals, there was much to look forward to, and the year was capped off with diminutive rover [[Tony Liberatore]] winning the Brownlow Medal.\n\nAfter a disappointing 1991, the Bulldogs bounced back in 1992, finishing second on the ladder and making their first finals appearance since 1985. [[Danny Del-Re]] was an excellent full forward, while champion veterans Hawkins, Royal, Wallis, Foster and MacPherson helped ensure the club played its best football in many years. Scott Wynd capped a magnificent year with the Brownlow Medal, while [[Chris Grant (footballer)|Chris Grant]] and [[Simon Atkins (footballer)|Simon Atkins]] also had outstanding seasons.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, the Bulldogs again made the finals, only to be eliminated by Melbourne and Geelong, respectively. [[Leon Cameron]] and [[Daniel Southern]] were stars. In August, Ted Whitten snr. died from prostate cancer; such was his status in the game that he was given a [[state funeral]]. In his honour, the club renamed the Western Oval the Whitten Oval, and a memorial statue of Whitten was erected outside the stadium.\n\nUnder the tightly focused management of club president [[David Smorgon]], driven coaching by [[Terry Wallace]], and the on-field leadership of [[Chris Grant (footballer)|Chris Grant]] (who narrowly missed a Brownlow Medal in 1996 and 1997) and [[Tony Liberatore]], the club had a successful period through the mid- to late 1990s, making the finals from 1997 to 2000. The 1997 season is remembered for the club's cruellest loss, to eventual premiers Adelaide in the preliminary final by two points after leading for much of the game and appearing to be headed for their first grand final since 1961. [[Rohan Smith]], [[Brad Johnson (Australian footballer)|Brad Johnson]], Chris Grant, [[Jose Romero (Australian rules footballer)|Jose Romero]], [[Paul Hudson (footballer)|Paul Hudson]] and company were catalysts in a fine season.\n\nThe Bulldogs would again feature in the finals in 1998, after heavily defeating West Coast in the qualifying finals, they met Adelaide again in the losing preliminary final. The Bulldogs eventfully lost by 68 points against the reigning premiers who went on to claim their second consecutive premiership in the grand final that following week.\n\nThe Bulldogs would make their third consecutive top 4 finish in 1999 but they suffered consecutive finals losses to West Coast and Brisbane.\n\nIn late 1996, the club changed its playing name from ''Footscray'' to the ''Western Bulldogs'' to market the club more broadly (specifically the western suburbs of Melbourne). To coincide with the change, the club moved their home games from the Whitten Oval, originally to [[MC Labour Park|Optus Oval]] from 1997 to 1999, and then to the newly built [[Docklands Stadium]] for the 2000 season.\n\n===2000s===\n:''Main articles: [[Western Bulldogs season 2009|Western Bulldogs seasons 2009]] and [[Western Bulldogs season 2010|2010]]''\n[[File:Western Bulldogs vs Collingwood 2004.jpg|thumb|Western Bulldogs players during warm-up against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in 2004]]\n\nDuring the 2000 season, the Bulldogs handed the eventual premiers, Essendon, their only loss for the year. That victory secured the Bulldogs a place in the finals for the fourth consecutive year. They would bow out in the first week of finals after being defeated by the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba. The Bulldogs missed out on the finals over the next two seasons. Terry Wallace left the club with one match left in 2002 and assistant coach [[Peter Rohde]] took charge. Philanthropist and long-time Bulldogs supporter [[Susan Alberti]] was elected to the club board in December 2004. After two miserable seasons, the Bulldogs appointed [[Rodney Eade]] as coach in 2005. Improvement was immediate, with the Bulldogs winning 11 games and finishing ninth on the ladder in 2005, missing out on the finals by just half a game. Missing the finals dealt a blow to both players and supporters of the team, as late season success led to the team being considered real premiership contenders.\n\nIn 2006, the Bulldogs continued to play well despite a disastrous run of injuries throughout the year; with five players having to have knee reconstructions, including captain [[Luke Darcy]]. Despite this setback, the Bulldogs finished the home-and-away season with 13 wins (see [[2006 AFL season]]), making it to the finals for the first time since 2000, with [[Scott West]] and Brad Johnson continuing their excellent play. They won the Elimination Final against Collingwood in front of 84,000 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) and reached the semi-finals before being defeated by eventual Premiers the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval]].\n\nOn 5 August 2006, [[Chris Grant (footballer)|Chris Grant]] broke the Western Bulldogs record for the most senior [[AFL/VFL]] games at the club. On this day he played his 330th game, breaking [[Doug Hawkins]]' previous record of 329 games.\n\nLooking for new markets, the club had played one game every year at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and one \"home\" game each year at [[Marrara Oval]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. On 16 August 2006, the league announced that the Bulldogs' Sydney \"home\" game would be played at [[Manuka Oval]], [[Canberra]] in 2007, 2008 and 2009.\n\n[[File:Brad johnson.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Brad Johnson (Australian footballer)|Brad Johnson]] was the club's captain from 2007 to 2010.]]\n\nPrior to the 2007 season, the Bulldogs made a splash by trading for [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] midfielder [[Jason Akermanis]]. They were premiership favourites early on in 2007, but yet again injuries took their toll, and they faltered in the last seven rounds, losing six games and drawing one, to finish 13th.\n\nIn the 2008 pre-season they traded away [[Jordan McMahon]] to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Sam Power]] to North Melbourne. They also recruited ruckman [[Ben Hudson]] and forward [[Scott Welsh]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] and back [[Tim Callan]] from Geelong in what was a very successful trade week. In [[2008 AFL Season|2008]], the Bulldogs were widely predicted for the bottom four after the [[2008 NAB Cup|pre-season]], but had a successful home-and-away season, finishing in third place with fifteen wins, one draw and six losses (five of which occurred in the season's last seven games). The team's finals campaign began with a loss to Hawthorn by 51 points at the MCG in the first qualifying final, but won the subsequent semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] by 37 points. The Bulldogs lost their preliminary final match against reigning premiers Geelong.\n\nMuch was expected of the Bulldogs following their 3rd-place finish in 2008. They began the 2009 season with a 63-point thrashing of [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] in Perth, and then recorded solid wins over North Melbourne and Richmond before losing their next three games to West Coast (in Perth), Carlton and St Kilda. The Bulldogs then notched up their first away win against Adelaide since 2001, kicking eight goals to one in the third quarter to win by 32 points. The following week, they survived a determined effort from Melbourne, winning by 7 points, before succumbing to Geelong in one of the best and closest games of the season. They proceeded to win their next five games, including a 93-point drubbing of Port Adelaide in Darwin and an 88-point win over the reigning premiers Hawthorn. After a bit of a dip in form including losses to Collingwood, St Kilda and West Coast, the Bulldogs rebounded with an 18-point win against Brisbane at [[the Gabba]]. That was followed up by a 14-point win over Geelong. In the final round of the home-and-away season, the Bulldogs needed to defeat Collingwood by more than 22 points to reclaim third place on the ladder. The Bulldogs managed win by 24 points, earning the right to play Geelong in the first week of the finals.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jennifer Witham | title=Bulldogs win secures third\n | date=30 August 2009 | url=http://www.westernbulldogs.com.au/season2009/news/newsarticle/tabid/4112/newsid/83819/default.aspx}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nThere was media expectation that the Western Bulldogs would again feature in the top four in 2010 after doing so in 2008 and 2009.  The [[2010 NAB Cup|pre-season]] delivered the Western Bulldogs their first competition victory since 1970 as they defeated {{AFL StK}} by 40 points in the NAB Cup Grand Final, with new recruit [[Barry Hall]] starring with seven goals and winning the [[Michael Tuck Medal]] for being the best player. However, after a promising pre-season, the Bulldogs failed to make their first grand final in 49 years after being demolished by {{AFL Col}} in the first round of the finals, coming back against the Sydney Swans and losing again to St Kilda in the preliminary final, captain Brad Johnson's last game.<ref>{{cite news|title=The difference \u2013 one big forward|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/the-difference--one-big-forward-20100313-q5et.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=14 March 2010|author=Peter Hanlon}}</ref>\n\nThe pain of three consecutive Preliminary final exits took its toll in [[2011 AFL Season|2011]]. After a 55-point thrashing at the hands of Essendon in the opening round, the season never looked on track. The Bulldogs lost 9 of their first 12 games, including 7 from 8 games between Rounds 5 and 12. Following a 49-point loss to Essendon in Round 21, coach Rodney Eade was sacked by the Western Bulldogs after seven years at the helm. The club finished the year with wins against Port Adelaide and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] and a loss against Hawthorn. The Bulldogs finished 2011 with a 9-win, 13-loss record for the season. Shortly after the 2011 season was completed, long-time Geelong and Essendon assistant [[Brendan McCartney]] was appointed as the senior coach on a three-year contract. During the following months, the Bulldogs assembled a coaching panel consisting of senior coach McCartney, former Geelong and St Kilda ruckman [[Steven King (footballer)|Steven King]], former Sydney Swans and North Melbourne midfielder [[Shannon Grant]], former Bulldogs champion and 300 game player Rohan Smith, and former Bulldogs and Port Adelaide player [[Brett Montgomery]].\n\nIn October 2012, long-time president David Smorgon stepped down from the role to be replaced by former president Peter Gordon. Smorgon served as president from 1996 to 2012, overseeing two rebuilding phases, the erasure of much debt and a period of stability after decades of uncertainty surrounding the club's future.\n\nIn 2013, the Bulldogs ended their affiliation with [[Williamstown Football Club]], establishing a reserves team in the [[Victorian Football League]] for the 2014 season. The team played under the name of Footscray and the decision proved an instant hit on and off the field, with supporters of the AFL club taking a strong liking to the newly established VFL team. The success flowed onto the field as well, with the club securing the VFL Premiership in its first season in the competition since 1924, defeating the Box Hill Hawks by 22 points in the VFL Grand Final.\n\nFollowing a disappointing season in 2014, the Bulldogs endured a tumultuous off-season. It began when [[Ryan Griffen]], who was widely regarded as the club's best player and had only been captain for one season, shocked the football world by requesting a trade to {{AFL GWS}}. He later cited the stress of captaincy as his reason for nearly giving up the game altogether.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-16/ryan-griffen-was-close-to-quitting-afl/5819550|title=Ryan Griffen was close to quitting AFL before joining GWS from Western Bulldogs|date=16 October 2014}}</ref> Two days later, senior coach McCartney handed in his resignation to the board.

Founded in 1877 in [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], an inner-western suburb of [[Melbourne]], the club won nine premierships in the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) before gaining entry to the Victorian Football League (since renamed the AFL) in 1925. The club has won two VFL/AFL premierships, in [[1954 VFL Grand Final|1954]] and [[2016 AFL Grand Final|2016]], and was runner up in [[1961 VFL Grand Final|1961]]. It has also claimed one premiership in the [[AFL Women's]] competition, in [[2018 AFL Women's Grand Final|2018]], having been a foundation member of the league the previous year.\n\nThe Western Bulldogs' home [[Guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]] features two thick horizontal hoops\u2014one red and one white\u2014on a royal blue background.\n\nThe club's headquarters and training facilities are located in Footscray at [[Whitten Oval]], nicknamed \"The Kennel\", its original home ground. The club draws much of its supporter base from Melbourne's traditionally working class western region, and plays its home matches at [[Docklands Stadium]] (currently known as Marvel Stadium) in the [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] area, also in the city's inner-west. In 1996, the club changed its name from the \"Footscray Football Club\" to the \"Western Bulldogs\".{{why|date=February 2020}} As well as their participation in AFL and AFLW, the club also fields reserves sides in the [[Victorian Football League]] and [[VFL Women's]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1877\u20131924: Origins, VFA years and Championship of Victoria===\n[[File:Footscray team 1898.jpg|thumb|right|The team that won the first premiership for the club in 1898]]\n[[File:Con McCarthy 1923.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Footscray captain [[Con McCarthy]] led the club to VFA premierships in 1923 and 1924, as well as the 1924 Championship of Victoria to gain entry into the VFL.]]\nNewspapers record Australian rules football being played in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] in the mid-1870s, during which time a local junior football club was formed. In 1880, the club changed its name to the Prince Imperials in honour of [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]], the heir to [[List of French monarchs|French throne]], who had recently died in battle. The club reverted to Footscray a few years later. In 1886, Footscray gained admission to the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) after amalgamating with the Footscray Cricket Club to form a senior football club. The club tended to struggle over the next decade, occupying the lower rungs of the VFA ladder.\n\nThe club began to improve after the [[Victorian Football League#Split|VFL breakaway of 1896]], finishing on top of the VFA ladder in 1898, 1899 and 1900. As no finals were played, Footscray were declared premiers. The club played in and won its first finals match in 1903, against {{AFL Ric}}, the minor premiers, but lost the follow-up finals match to {{AFL NM}}. After losing to [[West Melbourne Football Club|West Melbourne]] in the 1906 VFA Grand Final, the club won its first premiership by defeating [[Brunswick Football Club|Brunswick]] in 1908. Another premiership followed in 1913.\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match|1924 Championship of Victoria]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[File:AFL Footscray Icon.jpg|16px]] Footscray || '''9''' || '''10''' || '''64'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |[[File:EssendonDesign.svg|16px]] {{AFL Ess}} || 4 || 12 || 36\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 46,100\n|}\nThe club entered two years of recess during World War I and returned in 1918. Still rebuilding, the club won the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]]. From bottom to top in one year, 1919 saw the club win the premiership, and again in 1920. The club went back-to-back in 1923 and 1924.\n\nThe 1924 premiership would be Footscray's last in the VFA. After the 1924 season, the club challenged the premiers of the VFL, [[Essendon Bombers|Essendon]], to a charity match, otherwise known as the [[Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match|Championship of Victoria]], for the benefit of opera singer Dame [[Nellie Melba]]'s Limbless Soldiers' Appeal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Did the 1924 Bombers throw their last game?|url=http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977|work=AFL|publisher=Telstra Corporation Limited|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Lionel Frost|date=25 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090710013417/http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977|archivedate= 10 July 2009 }}</ref> Footscray recorded an upset victory, winning by 28 points. The win was a significant factor in Footscray gaining admission to the VFL.\n\n===1925\u20131940s: Joining the VFL===\nIn 1919, there were nine clubs competing in the VFL, due to the return of all the foundation teams plus Richmond after World War I, as well as [[University Football Club]] deciding not to rejoin the VFL. This caused one team to be idle every Saturday and the VFL was keen to do away with this bye each week. On the night of 9 January 1925, a committee meeting of the VFL, chaired by Reg Hunt of [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], decided to expand the league from nine clubs to twelve. It was decided in the meeting to admit Footscray, along with two other VFA clubs, {{AFL Haw}} and {{AFL NM}}.\n\nFootscray played their first VFL match against {{AFL Fit}} on Saturday 2 May at the [[Brunswick Street Oval]] in front of 28,000 spectators. Former {{AFL Ric}} star [[George Bayliss]] had the honour of kicking Footscray's first VFL goal, and although they ended up losing by nine points against an experienced league side, they earned great respect. Future Brownlow medallist [[Allan Hopkins]] was regarded as Footscray's best player that day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2113637 |title=Saturday's Results. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=24,566 |location=Melbourne|date=4 May 1925 |accessdate=8 February 2017 |page=9 }}</ref> The following week, playing their first VFL home game at the [[Whitten Oval|Western Oval]] against a strong {{AFL SM}} team, the Tricolours recorded their first VFL victory by 10 points in front of 25,000 spectators with a strong team effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2115597 |title=FOOTSCRAY'S FINE VICTORY. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=24,572 |location=Melbourne|date=11 May 1925 |accessdate=8 February 2017 |page=17 }}</ref>\n\nFootscray adapted relatively quickly to the standard of VFL football despite losing some of their VFA stars, and by 1928 were already a contender for the finals, missing only on percentage in 1931. Though they slipped to eleventh place in 1930, 1935 and 1937, in 1938 they became the first of the new clubs to reach the finals. They fell back drastically in 1939, but played better during the war-torn 1940s, winning their first nine games in 1946.\n\n===1950\u20131954: E. J.

In [[1953 VFL season|1953]], however, the club set a record by conceding only 959 points in the home-and-away season due to a powerful defence featuring Whitten, [[Dave Bryden]], [[Wally Donald]], [[Herb Henderson]] and [[Jim Gallagher (footballer)|Jim Gallagher]]. Footscray finally won its first semi-final, against Essendon, but lost the preliminary final to {{AFL Gee}}, a key factor being the absence of star full-forward [[Jack Collins (footballer, born 1930)|Jack Collins]], who had been suspended for four matches at the end of the home-and-away season.\n\nThe Bulldogs went into the [[1954 VFL season]] as premiership contenders.

Took out their first VFL premiership, beating [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and then {{AFL Mel}} in the [[1954 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1954 VFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[File:AFL Footscray Icon.jpg|16px]] Footscray || '''15''' || '''12''' || '''102'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |[[File:AFL Melbourne Icon.jpg|16px]] {{AFL Mel}} || 7 || 9 || 51\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 80,897\n|}\n\nThis success was in no small part due to two champions of the club \u2013 [[Charlie Sutton]] the wily and tough captain-coach at the time, and [[Ted Whitten]] snr., otherwise known as \"E. J.\" or \"Mr Football\", one of Australian rules football's best ever players. Sutton claims to have invented the modern play-on style of football \u2013 run, handball, run, kick. Whitten was famous for his inventive and lightning-fast ''flick pass'', which was banned due to the umpire's difficulty in distinguishing whether the ball was thrown, or hit with the open hand.\n\n===1955\u20131960s: Gradual decline===\nFootscray failed to capitalise on their premiership success, falling off in the latter part of the decade and finishing with their first [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in 1959.\n\nThe 1960s started promisingly, with the club bouncing back to reach the [[1961 VFL Grand Final|1961 Grand Final]], where they faced {{AFL Haw}} who were in their first Grand Final. This was the first VFL Grand Final not to feature any of the foundation teams. In front of over 107,000 spectators, the Bulldogs worked their way to an eight-point lead at half-time, but were clearly struggling with the physicality of their hardened opponents. Rover [[Merv Hobbs]] recalled eight players needing first aid, while ruckman [[John Schultz (footballer, born 1938)|John Schultz]] remembered: ''The selectors looked around and could see we were in a bad way. In those days, strange to realise, we didn't hydrate. We were told not to drink too much in case we got cramps. We just ran out of legs. And Hawthorn were brutal. They made every contest a physical clash. They wore us down.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-finals-new-dogs-pulling-off-old-tricks-at-footscray-20160921-grl8yc.html|title=AFL finals: New Dogs pulling off old tricks at Footscray|first=Greg|last=Baum|work=The Age|date=23 September 2016}}</ref> In the second half, the Hawks, led by centreman [[Brendan Edwards]], pulled away from the tiring Bulldogs, kicking ten goals to two to take out their first VFL premiership. This was followed by winning the 1963 and 1964 night premierships, although this success was not transferred into the season proper. The rest of the decade was a bleak era for the club, particularly between 1965 and 1969, when they finished in the bottom three every year.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Ted Whitten statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Footscray legend E. J. Whitten played his 321st and final game in 1970 to become the [[List of VFL/AFL players to have played 300 games#Games record holder|VFL games record holder]]. (Pictured: Statue of Whitten outside Whitten Oval.)]]\nTed Whitten Snr. retired as a player in 1970 and held the record for the most VFL games played at the time (321 games); he would continue in a coaching capacity until the end of 1971. The club was relatively strong in the 1970s, but did not win a final; by decade's end they were back near the bottom.\n\nThe main stars of the decade included [[Gary Dempsey (Australian footballer)|Gary Dempsey]], the heroic [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]] who was badly burnt in Lara bushfire of January 1969 but managed to take out the game's top individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1975. Promising South Australian import [[Neil Sachse]] had his neck broken in a freak accident while playing against Fitzroy at the Western Oval. He was left [[quadriplegic]].\nIn 1978, [[Kelvin Templeton]] became the first Bulldogs player to kick 100 goals in a season, including a club record of 15.9 in Round 13 against St Kilda.\n\n===1980s ===\nAfter muddling its way through a disappointing decade, having to sell many of its key players to survive, the Bulldogs would endure another tumultuous decade in the 1980s. To try and improve the club's fortunes, the committee appointed former Richmond champion [[Royce Hart]] as coach for the [[1980 VFL season]]. Things hit an all-time low in [[1982 VFL season|1982]]; the Bulldogs lost their opening round match to {{AFL Ess}} by 109 points and by the middle of the season, with only one win in 12 games and having lost the last eight matches, Hart was sacked and replaced with player [[Ian Hampshire]], who promptly quit his playing duties.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Age|first=Emma|last=Quayle|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/26/1053801337712.html|date=27 May 2003|title=Stick together, say the Dogs of '82}}</ref> One of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary season was the performance of Western Australian recruit [[Simon Beasley]], who kicked 82 goals for the season and proved himself one of the best full-forwards in the competition. He would go on to become the Bulldogs' record goalkicker.\n\n[[Mick Malthouse]] was appointed senior coach in 1984, and a dramatic improvement saw them rise to second position in 1985 before a ten-point loss in the preliminary finals against Hawthorn. The club boasted a list of top players at this time, with Beasley, [[Doug Hawkins]], [[Brian Royal]], [[Rick Kennedy]], [[Stephen Wallis]], [[Peter Foster (Australian rules footballer)|Peter Foster]], [[Michael McLean (footballer)|Michael McLean]], [[Jim Edmond]], [[Andrew Purser]], [[Stephen MacPherson]] and [[Brad Hardie]].\n\nThings didn't bode well for the Bulldogs early in the [[1987 VFL season]]. Hardie and Edmond had moved to the newly formed {{AFL BB}}, while Hawkins' return from his knee injury was still some time away. By Round 3 they were sitting on the bottom of the ladder after heavy losses to Essendon, {{AFL Syd}} and {{AFL Car}}. Footscray's revival started when, in one of the upsets of the season, they defeated the reigning premiers Hawthorn by 41 points in a display characterised by teamwork and desperation.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Prenesti|title=Footscray pulls out a do-or-die victory|url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=kLNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_5IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4222%2C368103|work=The Age|date=21 April 1987|page=39}}</ref> A seven-match winning streak mid-season saw them back in the Top Five. However, they just missed out on the finals when Melbourne defeated them in the last round in front of a record crowd at their home ground.\n\n====1989: Proposed merger and fightback====\nDiscontent between players, officials and fans reached an all-time low during the [[1989 VFL season]]. Club president [[Barrie Beattie]] was replaced by former Footscray board member, businessman and prominent racing personality [[Nick Columb]] in March. Things started promisingly with a 59-point win over a dispirited Carlton at [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]], with {{WAFL Sub}} recruit [[John Georgiades]] kicking eight goals on debut.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=208pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DJcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4713%2C3210270|title=Dogs' new litter leaves Blues flat|first=Garry|last=Linnell|work=The Age|page=32|date=3 April 1989}}</ref> However, it proved to be a false dawn; the Bulldogs would only win five more games for the season, with one draw, to finish 13th. The prevailing mood was best captured in Footscray's last win of the season in Round 20 against eventual wooden-spooners {{AFL Ric}}; although the Bulldogs won by 78 points, a meagre crowd of 8,673 turned up to what many believed at the time would be Footscray's last home game at the [[Whitten Oval|Western Oval]]. [[The Age|''Age'']] journalist [[Garry Linnell]] wrote: \"But saddest of all is that the suburb of Footscray has turned its back on the Western Oval and its football team. Without that support, one of the last remaining monuments to the days when Victorian football was a battle of suburban tribes has hit the dust.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gLMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SZEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1493%2C338779|title=Apathy rules as the West gives up on the Bulldogs|first=Garry|last=Linnell|date=21 August 1989|page=36|work=The Age}}</ref>\n \nFaced with the prospect of running a club with declining membership and sponsorship, Columb learned that Footscray's debt situation was poor, and it reached the point when the VFL looked likely to appoint an [[administration (law)|administrator]] to wind up the club's affairs at the end of the year.<ref name=\"4octms1\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=72|author=Michael Stevens|date=4 October 1989|title=No choice}}</ref> He decided the best way forward was a merger with {{AFL Fit}}, which was also in a weak financial position, although was not facing immediate bankruptcy. The two clubs announced a merger to form the [[Fitzroy Bulldogs]], but the merger was derailed when the people of Footscray, led by lawyer [[Peter Gordon (lawyer)|Peter Gordon]] and a host of others, rallied to raise funds to pay off the club's debts. In further developments, former club player [[Terry Wheeler]] was named as Malthouse's replacement as senior coach, while champion veteran [[Centre line (football)|wingman]] Doug Hawkins was appointed captain.  While Columb was branded by some as the villain of the story, the wisdom of hindsight shows that had he not instigated the merger, the Western Bulldogs would not exist as it does today.<ref>{{cite web | author=Mark Stevens | title=The 20-year miracle | date=4 September 2009 | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/the-20-year-miracle/story-e6frf9nx-1225769336965}}</ref><ref>''Unleashed \u2013 A History of the Footscray Football Club''</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nThe Bulldogs began the new decade in promising fashion, finishing in seventh place with twelve wins in 1990, including one against eventual premiers Collingwood, when [[Follower (Australian rules football)|rover]] [[Steven Kolyniuk]] ran around the man on the mark and kicked a goal to put his team in front. Although they just missed out on the finals, there was much to look forward to, and the year was capped off with diminutive rover [[Tony Liberatore]] winning the Brownlow Medal.\n\nAfter a disappointing 1991, the Bulldogs bounced back in 1992, finishing second on the ladder and making their first finals appearance since 1985. [[Danny Del-Re]] was an excellent full forward, while champion veterans Hawkins, Royal, Wallis, Foster and MacPherson helped ensure the club played its best football in many years. Scott Wynd capped a magnificent year with the Brownlow Medal, while [[Chris Grant (footballer)|Chris Grant]] and [[Simon Atkins (footballer)|Simon Atkins]] also had outstanding seasons.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, the Bulldogs again made the finals, only to be eliminated by Melbourne and Geelong, respectively. [[Leon Cameron]] and [[Daniel Southern]] were stars. In August, Ted Whitten snr. died from prostate cancer; such was his status in the game that he was given a [[state funeral]]. In his honour, the club renamed the Western Oval the Whitten Oval, and a memorial statue of Whitten was erected outside the stadium.\n\nUnder the tightly focused management of club president [[David Smorgon]], driven coaching by [[Terry Wallace]], and the on-field leadership of [[Chris Grant (footballer)|Chris Grant]] (who narrowly missed a Brownlow Medal in 1996 and 1997) and [[Tony Liberatore]], the club had a successful period through the mid- to late 1990s, making the finals from 1997 to 2000. The 1997 season is remembered for the club's cruellest loss, to eventual premiers Adelaide in the preliminary final by two points after leading for much of the game and appearing to be headed for their first grand final since 1961. [[Rohan Smith]], [[Brad Johnson (Australian footballer)|Brad Johnson]], Chris Grant, [[Jose Romero (Australian rules footballer)|Jose Romero]], [[Paul Hudson (footballer)|Paul Hudson]] and company were catalysts in a fine season.\n\nThe Bulldogs would again feature in the finals in 1998, after heavily defeating West Coast in the qualifying finals, they met Adelaide again in the losing preliminary final. The Bulldogs eventfully lost by 68 points against the reigning premiers who went on to claim their second consecutive premiership in the grand final that following week.\n\nThe Bulldogs would make their third consecutive top 4 finish in 1999 but they suffered consecutive finals losses to West Coast and Brisbane.\n\nIn late 1996, the club changed its playing name from ''Footscray'' to the ''Western Bulldogs'' to market the club more broadly (specifically the western suburbs of Melbourne). To coincide with the change, the club moved their home games from the Whitten Oval, originally to [[MC Labour Park|Optus Oval]] from 1997 to 1999, and then to the newly built [[Docklands Stadium]] for the 2000 season.\n\n===2000s===\n:''Main articles: [[Western Bulldogs season 2009|Western Bulldogs seasons 2009]] and [[Western Bulldogs season 2010|2010]]''\n[[File:Western Bulldogs vs Collingwood 2004.jpg|thumb|Western Bulldogs players during warm-up against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in 2004]]\n\nDuring the 2000 season, the Bulldogs handed the eventual premiers, Essendon, their only loss for the year. That victory secured the Bulldogs a place in the finals for the fourth consecutive year. They would bow out in the first week of finals after being defeated by the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba. The Bulldogs missed out on the finals over the next two seasons. Terry Wallace left the club with one match left in 2002 and assistant coach [[Peter Rohde]] took charge. Philanthropist and long-time Bulldogs supporter [[Susan Alberti]] was elected to the club board in December 2004. After two miserable seasons, the Bulldogs appointed [[Rodney Eade]] as coach in 2005. Improvement was immediate, with the Bulldogs winning 11 games and finishing ninth on the ladder in 2005, missing out on the finals by just half a game. Missing the finals dealt a blow to both players and supporters of the team, as late season success led to the team being considered real premiership contenders.\n\nIn 2006, the Bulldogs continued to play well despite a disastrous run of injuries throughout the year; with five players having to have knee reconstructions, including captain [[Luke Darcy]]. Despite this setback, the Bulldogs finished the home-and-away season with 13 wins (see [[2006 AFL season]]), making it to the finals for the first time since 2000, with [[Scott West]] and Brad Johnson continuing their excellent play. They won the Elimination Final against Collingwood in front of 84,000 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) and reached the semi-finals before being defeated by eventual Premiers the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval]].\n\nOn 5 August 2006, [[Chris Grant (footballer)|Chris Grant]] broke the Western Bulldogs record for the most senior [[AFL/VFL]] games at the club. On this day he played his 330th game, breaking [[Doug Hawkins]]' previous record of 329 games.\n\nLooking for new markets, the club had played one game every year at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and one \"home\" game each year at [[Marrara Oval]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. On 16 August 2006, the league announced that the Bulldogs' Sydney \"home\" game would be played at [[Manuka Oval]], [[Canberra]] in 2007, 2008 and 2009.\n\n[[File:Brad johnson.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Brad Johnson (Australian footballer)|Brad Johnson]] was the club's captain from 2007 to 2010.]]\n\nPrior to the 2007 season, the Bulldogs made a splash by trading for [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] midfielder [[Jason Akermanis]]. They were premiership favourites early on in 2007, but yet again injuries took their toll, and they faltered in the last seven rounds, losing six games and drawing one, to finish 13th.\n\nIn the 2008 pre-season they traded away [[Jordan McMahon]] to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Sam Power]] to North Melbourne. They also recruited ruckman [[Ben Hudson]] and forward [[Scott Welsh]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] and back [[Tim Callan]] from Geelong in what was a very successful trade week. In [[2008 AFL Season|2008]], the Bulldogs were widely predicted for the bottom four after the [[2008 NAB Cup|pre-season]], but had a successful home-and-away season, finishing in third place with fifteen wins, one draw and six losses (five of which occurred in the season's last seven games). The team's finals campaign began with a loss to Hawthorn by 51 points at the MCG in the first qualifying final, but won the subsequent semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] by 37 points. The Bulldogs lost their preliminary final match against reigning premiers Geelong.\n\nMuch was expected of the Bulldogs following their 3rd-place finish in 2008. They began the 2009 season with a 63-point thrashing of [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] in Perth, and then recorded solid wins over North Melbourne and Richmond before losing their next three games to West Coast (in Perth), Carlton and St Kilda. The Bulldogs then notched up their first away win against Adelaide since 2001, kicking eight goals to one in the third quarter to win by 32 points. The following week, they survived a determined effort from Melbourne, winning by 7 points, before succumbing to Geelong in one of the best and closest games of the season. They proceeded to win their next five games, including a 93-point drubbing of Port Adelaide in Darwin and an 88-point win over the reigning premiers Hawthorn. After a bit of a dip in form including losses to Collingwood, St Kilda and West Coast, the Bulldogs rebounded with an 18-point win against Brisbane at [[the Gabba]]. That was followed up by a 14-point win over Geelong. In the final round of the home-and-away season, the Bulldogs needed to defeat Collingwood by more than 22 points to reclaim third place on the ladder. The Bulldogs managed win by 24 points, earning the right to play Geelong in the first week of the finals.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jennifer Witham | title=Bulldogs win secures third\n | date=30 August 2009 | url=http://www.westernbulldogs.com.au/season2009/news/newsarticle/tabid/4112/newsid/83819/default.aspx}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nThere was media expectation that the Western Bulldogs would again feature in the top four in 2010 after doing so in 2008 and 2009.  The [[2010 NAB Cup|pre-season]] delivered the Western Bulldogs their first competition victory since 1970 as they defeated {{AFL StK}} by 40 points in the NAB Cup Grand Final, with new recruit [[Barry Hall]] starring with seven goals and winning the [[Michael Tuck Medal]] for being the best player. However, after a promising pre-season, the Bulldogs failed to make their first grand final in 49 years after being demolished by {{AFL Col}} in the first round of the finals, coming back against the Sydney Swans and losing again to St Kilda in the preliminary final, captain Brad Johnson's last game.<ref>{{cite news|title=The difference \u2013 one big forward|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/the-difference--one-big-forward-20100313-q5et.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=14 March 2010|author=Peter Hanlon}}</ref>\n\nThe pain of three consecutive Preliminary final exits took its toll in [[2011 AFL Season|2011]]. After a 55-point thrashing at the hands of Essendon in the opening round, the season never looked on track. The Bulldogs lost 9 of their first 12 games, including 7 from 8 games between Rounds 5 and 12. Following a 49-point loss to Essendon in Round 21, coach Rodney Eade was sacked by the Western Bulldogs after seven years at the helm. The club finished the year with wins against Port Adelaide and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] and a loss against Hawthorn. The Bulldogs finished 2011 with a 9-win, 13-loss record for the season. Shortly after the 2011 season was completed, long-time Geelong and Essendon assistant [[Brendan McCartney]] was appointed as the senior coach on a three-year contract. During the following months, the Bulldogs assembled a coaching panel consisting of senior coach McCartney, former Geelong and St Kilda ruckman [[Steven King (footballer)|Steven King]], former Sydney Swans and North Melbourne midfielder [[Shannon Grant]], former Bulldogs champion and 300 game player Rohan Smith, and former Bulldogs and Port Adelaide player [[Brett Montgomery]].\n\nIn October 2012, long-time president David Smorgon stepped down from the role to be replaced by former president Peter Gordon. Smorgon served as president from 1996 to 2012, overseeing two rebuilding phases, the erasure of much debt and a period of stability after decades of uncertainty surrounding the club's future.\n\nIn 2013, the Bulldogs ended their affiliation with [[Williamstown Football Club]], establishing a reserves team in the [[Victorian Football League]] for the 2014 season. The team played under the name of Footscray and the decision proved an instant hit on and off the field, with supporters of the AFL club taking a strong liking to the newly established VFL team. The success flowed onto the field as well, with the club securing the VFL Premiership in its first season in the competition since 1924, defeating the Box Hill Hawks by 22 points in the VFL Grand Final.\n\nFollowing a disappointing season in 2014, the Bulldogs endured a tumultuous off-season. It began when [[Ryan Griffen]], who was widely regarded as the club's best player and had only been captain for one season, shocked the football world by requesting a trade to {{AFL GWS}}. He later cited the stress of captaincy as his reason for nearly giving up the game altogether.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-16/ryan-griffen-was-close-to-quitting-afl/5819550|title=Ryan Griffen was close to quitting AFL before joining GWS from Western Bulldogs|date=16 October 2014}}</ref> Two days later, senior coach McCartney handed in his resignation to the board.

In January 2015, Simon Garlick resigned as CEO. [[Luke Beveridge]] was appointed senior coach for the Bulldogs and club stalwart, Robert Murphy was appointed captain.\n\nMany predicted the Bulldogs to struggle in 2015 after losing over 700 games of experience during the off-season, and those feelings were further strengthened when [[Tom Liberatore]], the reigning Charles Sutton Medallist, went down with a rupture to his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] in the [[NAB Challenge]] match against Richmond.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Fox Sports|first=Bruce|last=Matthews|title=Western Bulldogs midfielder Tom Liberatore tears ACL in NAB Challenge, AFL season over|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/news/western-bulldogs-midfielder-tom-liberatore-tears-acl-in-nab-challenge-afl-season-over/news-story/45b9bbbdd20adb06a919916a86a920f5|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> The Bulldogs defied the doubters to finish the home-and-away season in sixth position to feature in the finals for the first time since 2010.

He can be seen walking around the perimeter of the ground prior to the game. He then waits for the players to come out on the ground; they give him a pat as they run past to the banner. Sid, the club's previous real-life mascot, officially retired his club jumper at Etihad Stadium on 6 May 2017 and was given a lap of honour for his seven years of service to the Western Bulldogs.<ref name=\"nickname\">Talbot, Christopher (26 August 2016).

(This procedure was first used in the [[Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1985.)  The sequesters were designed to take place if the [[federal deficit]] exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets. In 2013 specifically, sequestration refers to a section of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (BCA) that was initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an [[austerity]] [[fiscal policy]]. These cuts were postponed by two months by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] until March 1, when this law went into effect.  At that time, most federal departments and agencies began furloughing their employees in order to meet their spending cut targets. For the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], almost all of the civilian workforce as well as most full-time, dual-status military technicians of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and the Reserves were affected. The initial furlough requirement was 176 working hours per affected employee, which was later cut to 88 hours.  Due to cost-cutting measures in other areas, this furlough was further reduced to a total of 48 working hours per [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] civilian and full-time Reserve Component member.\n\nLater, on October 1, 2013, at 12:01&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT, Congress' inability to agree on a spending bill led to a government shutdown.

Narasapuram.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe existence of Narsapur dates back to 1173&nbsp;AD. [[Dutch people]] landed in Narsapur in 1626. Narsapur was used as a port by the Dutch and ships and boats were built here. It was noted for its ship building activity and some of the Europeans also were customers at this place; small boats are still built in Narsapur. In the 16th century, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] established their own factory which remained as a trading centre for a few years. In the 18th century, Narsapur became an important trading port. From this port, teak was exported to other regions. The ports at [[Kakinada]] and Narsapuram became famous for manufacturing ships. At present there is no port handling at Narsapur.\n\nMadhavayapalem ([[Madapollam]]) is celebrated as one of the earliest places where the [[English people|English]] established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] and was famous for its trade in cloth. According to [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]]'s ''A New Account of the East Indies'' (1727): <blockquote>\"Next to Matchulipatam ([[Machilipatnam]]) is Narsipore, where the English had a Factory for long Cloth, for the Use of their Factory of Matchulipatam, when they manufactured Chintz there. It also affords good Teak Timber for building, and has a fine deep River, but a dangerous Bar, which makes it little frequented.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bowrey|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Bowrey|editor-last=Temple|editor-first=Richard Carnac|editor-link=Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baronet|title=A Geographical Account of Countries Round the Bay of Bengal, 1669 to 1679 |url=https://archive.org/details/ageographicalac00bowrgoog|year=1895|page=[https://archive.org/details/ageographicalac00bowrgoog/page/n171 99]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe trade of the town has steadily declined since the abolition of the company's factory in 1827.

Narasapuram.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe existence of Narsapur dates back to 1173&nbsp;AD. [[Dutch people]] landed in Narsapur in 1626. Narsapur was used as a port by the Dutch and ships and boats were built here. It was noted for its ship building activity and some of the Europeans also were customers at this place; small boats are still built in Narsapur. In the 16th century, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] established their own factory which remained as a trading centre for a few years. In the 18th century, Narsapur became an important trading port. From this port, teak was exported to other regions. The ports at [[Kakinada]] and Narsapuram became famous for manufacturing ships. At present there is no port handling at Narsapur.\n\nMadhavayapalem ([[Madapollam]]) is celebrated as one of the earliest places where the [[English people|English]] established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] and was famous for its trade in cloth. According to [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]]'s ''A New Account of the East Indies'' (1727): <blockquote>\"Next to Matchulipatam ([[Machilipatnam]]) is Narsipore, where the English had a Factory for long Cloth, for the Use of their Factory of Matchulipatam, when they manufactured Chintz there. It also affords good Teak Timber for building, and has a fine deep River, but a dangerous Bar, which makes it little frequented.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bowrey|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Bowrey|editor-last=Temple|editor-first=Richard Carnac|editor-link=Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baronet|title=A Geographical Account of Countries Round the Bay of Bengal, 1669 to 1679 |url=https://archive.org/details/ageographicalac00bowrgoog|year=1895|page=[https://archive.org/details/ageographicalac00bowrgoog/page/n171 99]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe trade of the town has steadily declined since the abolition of the company's factory in 1827.

The first part of the selection is common to all the FIPN units.  All National policemen and senior police officers may apply, as long as they meet the administrative criteria a minimum of five years of service and be no more than 35 years old.  About fifty candidates are selected and conveyed to the selected site where, during a first week, they must pass a series of events, records review, personality tests, combat ability, claustrophobia, giddiness, athletic ability, swimming etc.  At the end of this first week, part of the candidates are eliminated, and the others continue with mental tests during four days.

The first part of the selection is common to all the FIPN units.  All National policemen and senior police officers may apply, as long as they meet the administrative criteria a minimum of five years of service and be no more than 35 years old.
