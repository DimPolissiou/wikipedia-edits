This event determines the male and female world champions in the three disciplines of [[Climbing competition|sport climbing]]: [[lead climbing]], [[bouldering]], and [[speed climbing]]. Since 2012, a Combined ranking is also determined, for climbers competing in all disciplines, and additional medals are awarded based on that ranking.<ref name=\"Combined2012\" /><ref name=\"Combined2014\" /><ref name=\"Combined2016_1\" /><ref name=\"Combined2018\" />\n\nThe first event was organized in [[Frankfurt]] in 1991.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Creation and organisers ===\nIn 1991, the ''[[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]]'' (UIAA) organized the first climbing championships. The International Council for Competition Climbing (ICC) was created in 1997 as an internal body of the UIAA to take charge of competitions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/about-ifsc/what-is-the-ifsc/history |title=Climbing Competitions' History |publisher=ifsc-climbing.org |access-date=12 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033224/http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/about-ifsc/what-is-the-ifsc/history |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the independent IFSC was created as a continuation of the ICC to govern competition climbing.\n\n=== Events ===\nThe present format has four disciplines: lead, speed, bouldering, and combined.\n\nThe first championships had two events: lead and speed. Bouldering was added in 2001.\n\nIn 2012, 2014 and 2016, a combined ranking (sometimes also called overall ranking) was computed for climbers participating in all of the three events.<ref name=\"Combined2012\" /><ref name=\"Combined2014\" /><ref name=\"Combined2016_1\" /> In 2018, an specific combined event was included which the six climbers with highest overall ranking<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition#!comp=1564&cat=45|title=2018 World Championships \u2013 Combined general result \u2013 Men|publisher=IFSC|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition#!comp=1564&cat=42|title=2018 World Championships \u2013 Combined general result \u2013 Women|publisher=IFSC|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> were invited to enter. The combined event requires athletes to compete in all three disciplines, and they receive a single combined score based on all three results. Scores achieved in single-discipline events are not relevant to the combined score, and there are no awards for any one part of the combined event. The 2018 combined event tested the new [[Olympic Games]] format, which will be used at the first appearance of climbing at the Olympics in 2020. In 2019 the Combined competition was held again with the best eight men's and women's athletes receiving invitations to the [[Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Olympics]]. \n\nParaclimbing was introduced at the 2012 World Championships, but from 2019 it became its own championship, the [[IFSC Paraclimbing World Championships]].\n\n=== Years ===\nThe World Championships are held every two years. Twice, the cycle has been moved to the other year and in those cases this was done by holding the next championship one year earlier. In 2012 the World Championships were shifted to even years to avoid interference with the 2013 [[World Games]] climbing event and to give a supplementary opportunity to demonstrate the sport for a possible integration into the 2020 [[Olympic Games]]. In 2019 the World Championships were again held one year early, to now allow the Championships to be the year before each Olympics to operate as a qualifier event.{{Citation needed|date=October

Federation of Sport Climbing]] (IFSC). This event determines the male and female world champions in the three disciplines of [[Climbing competition|sport climbing]]: [[lead climbing]], [[bouldering]], and [[speed climbing]]. Since 2012, a Combined ranking is also determined, for climbers competing in all disciplines, and additional medals are awarded based on that ranking.<ref name=\"Combined2012\" /><ref name=\"Combined2014\" /><ref name=\"Combined2016_1\" /><ref name=\"Combined2018\" />\n\nThe first event was organized in [[Frankfurt]] in 1991.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Creation and organisers ===\nIn 1991, the ''[[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]]'' (UIAA) organized the first climbing championships. The International Council for Competition Climbing (ICC) was created in 1997 as an internal body of the UIAA to take charge of competitions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/about-ifsc/what-is-the-ifsc/history |title=Climbing Competitions' History |publisher=ifsc-climbing.org |access-date=12 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033224/http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/about-ifsc/what-is-the-ifsc/history |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the independent IFSC was created as a continuation of the ICC to govern competition climbing.\n\n=== Events ===\nThe present format has four disciplines: lead, speed, bouldering, and combined.\n\nThe first championships had two events: lead and speed. Bouldering was added in 2001.\n\nIn 2012, 2014 and 2016, a combined ranking (sometimes also called overall ranking) was computed for climbers participating in all of the three events.<ref name=\"Combined2012\" /><ref name=\"Combined2014\" /><ref name=\"Combined2016_1\" /> In 2018, an specific combined event was included which the six climbers with highest overall ranking<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition#!comp=1564&cat=45|title=2018 World Championships \u2013 Combined general result \u2013 Men|publisher=IFSC|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition#!comp=1564&cat=42|title=2018 World Championships \u2013 Combined general result \u2013 Women|publisher=IFSC|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> were invited to enter. The combined event requires athletes to compete in all three disciplines, and they receive a single combined score based on all three results. Scores achieved in single-discipline events are not relevant to the combined score, and there are no awards for any one part of the combined event. The 2018 combined event tested the new [[Olympic Games]] format, which will be used at the first appearance of climbing at the Olympics in 2020. In 2019 the Combined competition was held again with the best eight men's and women's athletes receiving invitations to the [[Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Olympics]]. \n\nParaclimbing was introduced at the 2012 World Championships, but from 2019 it became its own championship, the [[IFSC Paraclimbing World Championships]].\n\n=== Years ===\nThe World Championships are held every two years. Twice, the cycle has been moved to the other year and in those cases this was done by holding the next championship one year earlier. In 2012 the World Championships were shifted to even years to avoid interference with the 2013 [[World Games]] climbing event and to give a supplementary opportunity to demonstrate the sport for a possible integration into the 2020 [[Olympic Games]]. In 2019 the World Championships were again held one year early, to now allow the Championships to be the year before each Olympics to operate as a qualifier event.{{Citation needed|date=October

Outkast released their debut album ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'' in 1994, which gained popularity after the single \"[[Player's Ball]]\" reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. With successive releases including ''[[ATLiens]]'' (1996) and ''[[Aquemini]]'' (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed ''[[Stankonia]]'', which included the singles \"[[Ms. Jackson]]\" and \"[[Bombs Over Baghdad|B.O.B.]]\"\n\nIn September 2003, the duo released the [[double album]] ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', which featured the number one singles \"[[Hey Ya!]]\" and \"[[The Way You Move]].\" The album won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Outkast next released [[Idlewild (OutKast album)|the soundtrack]] for the 2006 musical film ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', which they also starred in. In 2007,  the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the [[Coachella Festival]] in April.<ref>[http://www.stereogum.com/1623152/coachella-2014-lineup/news/ Coachella 2014 Lineup].

Between [[Outkast discography|six studio albums]] and a [[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast|greatest hits]] release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records.{{fact|date=March 2020}} Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Pitchfork Media]] listing albums such as ''Aquemini'' and ''Stankonia'' among the best of their era.\n\n==History==\n===1992\u20131995: Formation and debut===\n[[File:Lenox Square.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi met as teenagers at Atlanta's [[Lenox Square]] shopping center (pictured).]]\nBenjamin and Patton met in 1992 at the [[Lenox Square]] shopping mall when they were both sixteen years old.<ref name=\"Melody\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/22/entertainment/ca-40125|title=Melody Makers of Hip-Hop|last=Guzman|first=Isaac|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein|date=October 22, 2000|accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref> The two lived in the [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]] section of [[Atlanta]] and attended Tri-Cities High School.<ref name=\"Melody\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pauley|first1=Jared|title=Outkast}}</ref> During school, Benjamin and Patton participated in [[rap battle]]s in the cafeteria.<ref name=\"Melody\"/> Benjamin's parents were divorced and he was living with his father.

Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by [[Organized Noize]], a group of local producers who would later make hits for the R&B girl group [[TLC (music)|TLC]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> The duo initially wanted to be called \"2 Shades Deep\" or \"The Misfits\", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use \"OutKast\" based on finding \"outcast\" as a [[synonym]] for \"misfit\" in a dictionary.<ref name=\"notable bio\">{{cite web|title=OutKast Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Li-Ou/OutKast.html|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2006|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref> OutKast, [[Organized Noize]], and schoolmates [[Goodie Mob]] formed the nucleus of the [[Dungeon Family]] organization.\n\nOutKast signed to L.A.

During the [[holiday season]] of 1993, they released their first [[Single (music)|single]], \"[[Player's Ball]]\". The song's [[funk music|funky]] style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences. \"Player's Ball\" hit number-one on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> 'Player's Ball' also topped the R&B charts for six weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Outkast- Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik|publisher=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n\nTheir debut album,  ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'', was issued on April 26, 1994. This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many.

The album was seen as a change in the group's musical style, as it had a more commercial and mainstream appeal, compared to their previous three albums which were darker and deeper. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple-platinum]]. ''[[Stankonia]]'s'' first single was \"[[B.O.B.

The second single, \"[[Ms. Jackson]]\", combined a pop hook with lyrics about [[divorce]] and relationship breakups, particularly Andr\u00e9's breakup with singer [[Erykah Badu]]; the titular \"Ms. Jackson\" character being a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] for Badu's mother.

One of these new tracks was the single \"[[The Whole World]]\", which won a 2002 Grammy Award for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. [[Killer Mike]] also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called \"Funkin' Around\" and \"Movin' Cool (The After Party)\".\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below''===\nOutKast spent 2 years working on their 5th effort, before releasing a double album, ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', on September 23, 2003. It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear and co produce on each other's discs for a few songs apiece. Big Boi's ''Speakerboxxx'' is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; Andr\u00e9 3000's ''The Love Below'' features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in [[funk music|funk]], jazz, rock, electronic music, and [[R&B]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nThe album is also OutKast's biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks. The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certification, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|diamond]] for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nThe first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi's \"[[The Way You Move]]\" and Andre 3000's \"[[Hey Ya!]]\" The video's storyline has \"The Love Below\"\u2014a fictional band with all members, through the use of [[special effects]], played by Andr\u00e9\u2014performing in [[London]]. \"Hey Ya!\" was the number one song on the very final weekend of ''American Top 40 with [[Casey Kasem]]''. It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with [[Ryan Seacrest]]. The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the [[Hot 100]] singles chart, with \"Hey Ya!\" spending nine weeks and \"The Way You Move\" taking over for one week in February 2004. These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nOutKast's next official single was not released until the summer of 2004. \"[[Roses (OutKast song)|Roses]]\", a track featuring both members from ''The Love Below'' half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for \"Roses\" is loosely based on the musicals ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. It featured sparring 1950s' style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better. It deviates from these musicals in its final act, however, by featuring Andre 3000 defecating in a bouquet of roses before entering a [[Ramping Shop]] and presenting them to the receptionist. This closing scene was nominated as a finalist for the BET \"Realest Music Video of All Time\" award. The final singles were Andr\u00e9 3000's \"[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Prototype]]\", which was paired with a [[science fiction]]-themed video about alien visitors, and ''Speakerboxxx's'' \"[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Ghettomusick]]\", which featured both members of OutKast and a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from a song by [[Patti LaBelle]], who also makes an appearance in the video.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\n''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below'' won the Grammy Award for the 2004. OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed \"The Way You Move\" with the Outkast backing band during a medley with Earth Wind & Fire, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], while Andr\u00e9 3000 performed \"Hey Ya!\" as the show closer after they had been presented with the Album Of The Year Award.\n\n[[File:BigBoi.jpg|thumb|Big Boi performing in 2006 in Atlanta]]\n\n===2005\u20132006: ''Idlewild''===\nMembers also began working on a joint film, ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', directed by OutKast music video director [[Bryan Barber]].

In tune with the film, ''Idlewild'' reflects OutKast's original style tempered by 1930s influences.

LaFace Records}}\nIn April 1999, OutKast and [[LaFace Records]] were [[lawsuit|sued]] by [[Rosa Parks]] over ''Aquemini'''s most successful radio single, which bears Parks' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks' name, and it objected to the song's [[obscenity|obscenities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Aliya|title=Rosa Parks Sues OutKast|journal=Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=April 17, 1999|volume=108|issue=4|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe song's lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: \"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus\". The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as [[Homage (arts)|homage]], refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop's old order, and that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for OutKast.\n\nLater on appeal, the issue of whether OutKast violated the [[Lanham Act]] for [[false advertising]] was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title \"Rosa Parks\" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]] to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied. The judge ruled that while there was linkage between the song and Rosa Parks, the song was an \"expressive work\" and was therefore protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} \n\nIn December 2003, Andr\u00e9 told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a [[Detroit]] concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case had less to do with Parks than with the lawyers.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-2302431.html &#91;Title/date?&#93;].

During the [[holiday season]] of 1993, they released their first [[Single (music)|single]], \"[[Player's Ball]]\". The song's [[funk music|funky]] style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences. \"Player's Ball\" hit number-one on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> 'Player's Ball' also topped the R&B charts for six weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Outkast- Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik|publisher=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n\nTheir debut album,  ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'', was issued on April 26, 1994.

Follow-up singles included the title track and \"Git Up Git Out\", a politically charged collaboration with [[Goodie Mob]] that was later sampled by [[Macy Gray]] for her 1999 hit \"Do Something.\" On this early material, both Andr\u00e9 and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of [[pimp]]s and [[gangster]]s with politically conscious material commenting on the status of [[African Americans]] in the South.

The album was seen as a change in the group's musical style, as it had a more commercial and mainstream appeal, compared to their previous three albums which were darker and deeper. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple-platinum]]. ''[[Stankonia]]'s'' first single was \"[[B.O.B.

The second single, \"[[Ms. Jackson]]\", combined a pop hook with lyrics about [[divorce]] and relationship breakups, particularly Andr\u00e9's breakup with singer [[Erykah Badu]]; the titular \"Ms. Jackson\" character being a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] for Badu's mother.

All three singles' videos had heavy [[MTV2]] airplay, and OutKast won two 2001 [[Grammy Award]]s, one for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for \"Ms. Jackson\", and another for ''[[Stankonia]]'' as [[Best Rap Album]].<ref>Cowie, Del F..

One of these new tracks was the single \"[[The Whole World]]\", which won a 2002 Grammy Award for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. [[Killer Mike]] also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called \"Funkin' Around\" and \"Movin' Cool (The After Party)\".\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below''===\nOutKast spent 2 years working on their 5th effort, before releasing a double album, ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', on September 23, 2003. It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear and co produce on each other's discs for a few songs apiece. Big Boi's ''Speakerboxxx'' is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; Andr\u00e9 3000's ''The Love Below'' features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in [[funk music|funk]], jazz, rock, electronic music, and [[R&B]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nThe album is also OutKast's biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks. The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certification, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|diamond]] for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nThe first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi's \"[[The Way You Move]]\" and Andre 3000's \"[[Hey Ya!]]\" The video's storyline has \"The Love Below\"\u2014a fictional band with all members, through the use of [[special effects]], played by Andr\u00e9\u2014performing in [[London]]. \"Hey Ya!\" was the number one song on the very final weekend of ''American Top 40 with [[Casey Kasem]]''. It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with [[Ryan Seacrest]]. The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the [[Hot 100]] singles chart, with \"Hey Ya!\" spending nine weeks and \"The Way You Move\" taking over for one week in February 2004. These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nOutKast's next official single was not released until the summer of 2004. \"[[Roses (OutKast song)|Roses]]\", a track featuring both members from ''The Love Below'' half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for \"Roses\" is loosely based on the musicals ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. It featured sparring 1950s' style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better. It deviates from these musicals in its final act, however, by featuring Andre 3000 defecating in a bouquet of roses before entering a [[Ramping Shop]] and presenting them to the receptionist. This closing scene was nominated as a finalist for the BET \"Realest Music Video of All Time\" award. The final singles were Andr\u00e9 3000's \"[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Prototype]]\", which was paired with a [[science fiction]]-themed video about alien visitors, and ''Speakerboxxx's'' \"[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Ghettomusick]]\", which featured both members of OutKast and a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from a song by [[Patti LaBelle]], who also makes an appearance in the video.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\n''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below'' won the Grammy Award for the 2004. OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed \"The Way You Move\" with the Outkast backing band during a medley with Earth Wind & Fire, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], while Andr\u00e9 3000 performed \"Hey Ya!\" as the show closer after they had been presented with the Album Of The Year Award.\n\n[[File:BigBoi.jpg|thumb|Big Boi performing in 2006 in Atlanta]]\n\n===2005\u20132006: ''Idlewild''===\nMembers also began working on a joint film, ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', directed by OutKast music video director [[Bryan Barber]].

In tune with the film, ''Idlewild'' reflects OutKast's original style tempered by 1930s influences.

The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks' name, and it objected to the song's [[obscenity|obscenities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Aliya|title=Rosa Parks Sues OutKast|journal=Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=April 17, 1999|volume=108|issue=4|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe song's lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: \"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus\". The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as [[Homage (arts)|homage]], refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop's old order, and that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for OutKast.\n\nLater on appeal, the issue of whether OutKast violated the [[Lanham Act]] for [[false advertising]] was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title \"Rosa Parks\" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]] to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied. The judge ruled that while there was linkage between the song and Rosa Parks, the song was an \"expressive work\" and was therefore protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} \n\nIn December 2003, Andr\u00e9 told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a [[Detroit]] concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case had less to do with Parks than with the lawyers.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-2302431.html &#91;Title/date?&#93;].

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat.<ref name='defra1'>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |title=Arbroath Smokie PGI \n |accessdate=8 February 2009 \n |date=31 March 2004 \n |work=Protected Food Names \n |publisher=HM Government \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130959/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |archivedate=25 December 2008 \n |url-status = dead\n |df=dmy \n}} \n</ref> The preparation of smokies remains a [[cottage industry]] in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

When Ram visits Janani, she reciprocates his love. Janani's sister Sumi makes sure that her parents are not aware of their secret relationship.\n\nBack in the present, Janani has a teary conversation with her mother about Ram. Asleep, she experiences another flashback about when her family had a visa to go to the US, but she burned her passport in order to stay with Ram and marry him. They later were given a house by Ram's dad.\n\nAfter Janani is awoken by her maid, she finds a suicide letter from Ram in his coat. She visits Senthil and asks him to reveal what they were hiding from her. A distraught Senthil tells her that when she was leaving for the US, Kumaran got a job in Singapore at the same time. Upon finding out that two of the people closest to him were leaving, Ram becomes more unstable. On a day when Ram took a 3.2 crore loss, he kicks and kills Tom, their dog. This leads Senthil to consult a doctor, who tells him that Ram's actions are symptomatic of bipolar disorder, and if not treated, could lead to suicide. When Senthil tries to warn him, Ram attacks Senthil with a bottle and chair, and later falls unconscious on the road.\n\nThe doctor confirms Ram has severe bipolar disorder, but Ram refuses Senthil's pleas to get admitted because of his love for Janani. To save himself, Ram then goes on a pilgrimage, causing further anguish. Janani notices and asks Ram why he is acting weird. Later, at a club, Ram punches a drunk rowdy trying to misbehave with Janani, and later he and Senthil are beat up by his gang, but when the rowdy tries to kill him Ram beats up the gang. Ram spends time in the hospital as his condition worsens, but Janani becomes frustrated with Ram not telling her where he went. Ram, in a manic state, tries to kill Janani but is stopped by Senthil.\n\nRam gets his company shares to be transferred to Janani, and wants Senthil to leave him to see her. Senthil refuses, and Ram suddenly bashes his head against a steering wheel, rendering him unconscious. Ram tearfully says goodbye to Senthil and leaves the car. In the present, Senthil and Janani are both crying profusely. As he goes to Janani's bedroom and watches her sleep, he suddenly hallucinates seeing a young girl saying \"Either kill her or you die.\" Terrified, he immediately gets away from her bed. He goes to his office and writes a suicide note while the hallucinations continue. Ram picks up a knife and slits his throat, saying his final words, \"I love you, Janani\". The film ends with Janani wailing in grief as she learns her husband's fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dhanush]] as Ram\n* [[Shruti Haasan]] as Janani, Ram's wife\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Ram's father, a businessman\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Kumaran, Ram's friend since school days\n* [[Bhanupriya]] as Ram's mother\n* [[Sunder Ramu]] as Senthil, Ram's work friend, the only one who knew of his condition \n* [[Jeeva Ravi|Ravi]] as Janani's father\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Janani's mother\n* [[Gabriella Charlton]] as Sumi, Janani's mute sister\n* [[Badava Gopi]] as Teacher\n* Anuradha Krishnamurthy as Senthil's mother\n* Sunitha Gogoi as Janani's friend\n\n==Production==\nAishwarya stated that the script was written with [[Shruti Haasan]] in mind, but the actress was initially unavailable to do the film.

When Ram visits Janani, she reciprocates his love. Janani's sister Sumi makes sure that her parents are not aware of their secret relationship.\n\nBack in the present, Janani has a teary conversation with her mother about Ram. Asleep, she experiences another flashback about when her family had a visa to go to the US, but she burned her passport in order to stay with Ram and marry him. They later were given a house by Ram's dad.\n\nAfter Janani is awoken by her maid, she finds a suicide letter from Ram in his coat. She visits Senthil and asks him to reveal what they were hiding from her. A distraught Senthil tells her that when she was leaving for the US, Kumaran got a job in Singapore at the same time. Upon finding out that two of the people closest to him were leaving, Ram becomes more unstable. On a day when Ram took a 3.2 crore loss, he kicks and kills Tom, their dog. This leads Senthil to consult a doctor, who tells him that Ram's actions are symptomatic of bipolar disorder, and if not treated, could lead to suicide. When Senthil tries to warn him, Ram attacks Senthil with a bottle and chair, and later falls unconscious on the road.\n\nThe doctor confirms Ram has severe bipolar disorder, but Ram refuses Senthil's pleas to get admitted because of his love for Janani. To save himself, Ram then goes on a pilgrimage, causing further anguish. Janani notices and asks Ram why he is acting weird. Later, at a club, Ram punches a drunk rowdy trying to misbehave with Janani, and later he and Senthil are beat up by his gang, but when the rowdy tries to kill him Ram beats up the gang. Ram spends time in the hospital as his condition worsens, but Janani becomes frustrated with Ram not telling her where he went. Ram, in a manic state, tries to kill Janani but is stopped by Senthil.\n\nRam gets his company shares to be transferred to Janani, and wants Senthil to leave him to see her. Senthil refuses, and Ram suddenly bashes his head against a steering wheel, rendering him unconscious. Ram tearfully says goodbye to Senthil and leaves the car. In the present, Senthil and Janani are both crying profusely. As he goes to Janani's bedroom and watches her sleep, he suddenly hallucinates seeing a young girl saying \"Either kill her or you die.\" Terrified, he immediately gets away from her bed. He goes to his office and writes a suicide note while the hallucinations continue. Ram picks up a knife and slits his throat, saying his final words, \"I love you, Janani\". The film ends with Janani wailing in grief as she learns her husband's fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dhanush]] as Ram\n* [[Shruti Haasan]] as Janani, Ram's wife\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Ram's father, a businessman\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Kumaran, Ram's friend since school days\n* [[Bhanupriya]] as Ram's mother\n* [[Sunder Ramu]] as Senthil, Ram's work friend, the only one who knew of his condition \n* [[Jeeva Ravi|Ravi]] as Janani's father\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Janani's mother\n* [[Gabriella Charlton]] as Sumi, Janani's mute sister\n* [[Badava Gopi]] as Teacher\n* Anuradha Krishnamurthy as Senthil's mother\n* Sunitha Gogoi as Janani's friend\n\n==Production==\nAishwarya stated that the script was written with [[Shruti Haasan]] in mind, but the actress was initially unavailable to do the film.

It was written and directed by [[Wil Shriner]], and produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Walden Media]]. The film stars [[Luke Wilson]], [[Logan Lerman]], [[Brie Larson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Neil Flynn]] and [[Robert Wagner]]. Filming took place from July to September 2005 in Florida, with additional shooting in California the following January. The project was released on May 5, 2006. ''Hoot'' was a [[box office bomb]] in its initial theatrical run, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe film is about a group of children trying to save a [[burrowing owl]] habitat from destruction. Its habitat is located on the intended construction site of a pancake house. The developer of the project intends to proceed regardless of the environmental damage it would cause. ''Hoot'' features live burrowing owls and music by [[Jimmy Buffett]]. Buffett is also listed as a co-producer, and he played the role of Mr. Ryan, the science teacher.\n\n==Plot==\nMiddle school student Roy A. Eberhardt ([[Logan Lerman]]) and his parents ([[Neil Flynn]] and [[Kiersten Warren]]) have just moved to [[Coconut Cove]], [[Florida]] from [[Montana]]. Roy is mercilessly teased and bullied at his new school by Dana Matherson (Eric Phillips), until he accidentally breaks Matherson's nose while getting harassed on the school bus and is struggling to get free. As a result, Roy gets suspended from riding the school bus for three days and must write Dana an apology letter as a punishment. Roy slowly becomes friends with Beatrice \"The Bear\" Leep ([[Brie Larson]]), and her stepbrother \"Mullet Fingers\" ([[Cody Linley]]).\n\nMeanwhile, someone is responsible for sabotage on a local construction site where a \"Mother Paula's Pancake House\" restaurant, overseen by corrupt regional manager Chuck Muckle ([[Clark Gregg]]), is about to be built. In order to catch the trespassers and prevent further vandalism, Officer David Delinko ([[Luke Wilson]]) has parked his police cruiser on the building site. Delinko falls asleep and an unknown prankster vandalizes the car by spray painting its windows black. The next day at breakfast, Roy and his parents read about the spray painted police car. The police chief then gives Delinko a small police scooter to replace the vandalized cruiser.\n\nSoon, Roy learns that in order to build the pancake house, they must first destroy the burrowing owls living on site. Mullet Fingers has been covertly pulling pranks to stop construction (including the tagging of Delinko's car), but Beatrice must take Roy into their confidence when he is badly bitten by guard dogs. Roy joins their crusade to save the endangered owls. Leroy \"Curly\" Branitt ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), the beleaguered construction foreman, is trying to keep the construction schedule going, despite the presence of the owls, due to daily abuse from Muckle over the phone, and later in person.\n\nIn the end, the trio reveals to Delinko and the rest of the town that there are burrowing owls on the lot. They then manage to get everyone to be quiet long enough for the owls to emerge. As Muckle is fired from his job and arrested for his actions, Kimberly ([[Jessica Cauffiel]]), the actress who plays Mother Paula, offers Coconut Cove the site as an owl preserve in the interest of damage control.\n\nUltimately Roy's parents decide to stay in Florida, Officer Delinko finally gets promoted to detective and gets an unmarked patrol car (until he accidentally backed it off a fishing pier), Dana is sent off to military school where he gets tortured by his drill sergeant, Muckle does community service for 90 days (But then gets sentenced to another 30 days by the judge due to lying down on the job after getting hit in the head with a coconut), the land becomes donated and turned into an animal sanctuary and the owls continue to live there, Curly and Kimberly leave Mother Paula's Pancake House to raise dogs, and Roy continues to be friends with Beatrice and Mullet Fingers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Officer David Delinko, a police officer in Coconut Cove.\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as Roy A.

It was written and directed by [[Wil Shriner]], and produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Walden Media]]. The film stars [[Luke Wilson]], [[Logan Lerman]], [[Brie Larson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Neil Flynn]] and [[Robert Wagner]]. Filming took place from July to September 2005 in Florida, with additional shooting in California the following January. The project was released on May 5, 2006. ''Hoot'' was a [[box office bomb]] in its initial theatrical run, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe film is about a group of children trying to save a [[burrowing owl]] habitat from destruction. Its habitat is located on the intended construction site of a pancake house. The developer of the project intends to proceed regardless of the environmental damage it would cause. ''Hoot'' features live burrowing owls and music by [[Jimmy Buffett]]. Buffett is also listed as a co-producer, and he played the role of Mr. Ryan, the science teacher.\n\n==Plot==\nMiddle school student Roy A. Eberhardt ([[Logan Lerman]]) and his family ([[Neil Flynn]] and [[Kiersten Warren]]) have just moved to [[Coconut Cove]], [[Florida]] from [[Montana]]. Roy is mercilessly teased and bullied at his new school by Dana Matherson (Eric Phillips), until he accidentally breaks Matherson's nose while getting harassed on the school bus and is struggling to get free. As a result, Roy gets suspended from riding the school bus for three days and must write Dana an apology letter as a punishment. Roy slowly becomes friends with Beatrice \"The Bear\" Leep ([[Brie Larson]]), and her stepbrother \"Mullet Fingers\" ([[Cody Linley]]).\n\nMeanwhile, someone is responsible for sabotage on a local construction site where a \"Mother Paula's Pancake House\" restaurant, overseen by corrupt regional manager Chuck Muckle ([[Clark Gregg]]), is about to be built. In order to catch the trespassers and prevent further vandalism, Officer David Delinko ([[Luke Wilson]]) has parked his police cruiser on the building site. Delinko falls asleep and an unknown prankster vandalizes the car by spray painting its windows black. The next day at breakfast, Roy and his parents read about the spray painted police car. The police chief then gives Delinko a small police scooter to replace the vandalized cruiser.\n\nSoon, Roy learns that in order to build the pancake house, they must first destroy the burrowing owls living on site. Mullet Fingers has been covertly pulling pranks to stop construction (including the tagging of Delinko's car), but Beatrice must take Roy into their confidence when he is badly bitten by guard dogs. Roy joins their crusade to save the endangered owls. Leroy \"Curly\" Branitt ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), the beleaguered construction foreman, is trying to keep the construction schedule going, despite the presence of the owls, due to daily abuse from Muckle over the phone, and later in person.\n\nIn the end, the trio reveals to Delinko and the rest of the town that there are burrowing owls on the lot. They then manage to get everyone to be quiet long enough for the owls to emerge. As Muckle is fired from his job and arrested for his actions, Kimberly ([[Jessica Cauffiel]]), the actress who plays Mother Paula, offers Coconut Cove the site as an owl preserve in the interest of damage control.\n\nUltimately Roy's parents decide to stay in Florida, Officer Delinko finally gets promoted to detective and gets an unmarked patrol car (until he accidentally backed it off a fishing pier), Dana is sent off to military school where he gets tortured by his drill sergeant, Muckle does community service for 90 days (But then gets sentenced to another 30 days by the judge due to lying down on the job after getting hit in the head with a coconut), the land becomes donated and turned into an animal sanctuary and the owls continue to live there, Curly and Kimberly leave Mother Paula's Pancake House to raise dogs, and Roy continues to be friends with Beatrice and Mullet Fingers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Officer David Delinko, a police officer in Coconut Cove.\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as Roy A.

The kunsthalle-style institution typically presents four exhibitions each year, along with concerts, performances, screenings, readings, and lectures\u2014all of which are free and open to the public. \u201cThe Ren\u201d also produces publications in conjunction with many of its exhibitions.\n==History==\n===Early Years===\nThe Renaissance Society was founded in the wake of the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 at the Art Institute, which had travelled to Chicago after its contentious time in New York. Then called the International Exhibition of Modern, the show was met with outrage and and incomprehension in New York, leading to a similarly fervent uproar when it traveled to Chicago. In the aftermath, it was clear that the city, and the American populace as a whole, were generally opposed to the post-impressionist, cubist, and futurist art that was presented.\n\nThe Society was founded shortly after in 1915. Member and secretary of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees, James Spencer Dickerson, felt it would be a nice to have particular portrait of poet Robert Browning in Harper Library, but there was no fund for such an acquisition. Consequently, he proposed an organization called \u201cFriends of Art of the University of Chicago\u201d which could provide said funding.<ref name=\"first history\">{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=14}}</ref> On April 20, 1915, ten professors of the university convened at the Quadrangle Club in an exploratory meeting; and subsequently, a larger meeting was held on June 3 in Harper Assembly Hall of Cobb Hall to garner broader support for this organization.<ref name=\"first history\" /> There, \u201ca committee of five [\u2026] chaired by J. Laurence Laughlin, professor and head of the Department of Political Economy, was appointed to consider the organization of the art society and draft a constitution.\u201d<ref name=\"first history\" /> The president of the University approved and worked to assist in the establishment of the society. However, it was not until April 24, 1916 that the next formal meeting was held in the Classics Building.<ref name=\"first history\" /> Twelve women and fourteen men voted to accept the constitution that was drafted by the committee. They then elected a president and and an all-male executive committee. A further three women were added as vice presidents to rectify the gender imbalance.\n\nThe constitution ensured that the society would not become a collecting museum by stipulating that \u201call acquisitions of The Society, except money, shall become the property of the University of Chicago.\u201d<ref name=\"first history\" /> The document stated the mission:\n:It shall be the aim of The Society to provide at the University such material means and personal influences as will contribute to the cultivation of the arts, and the enrichment of the life of the community.\nThe society would organize exhibitions, encourage gifts of art to the university, sponsor lectures on the arts, issue publications, and use other such means to accomplish its mission. Programming elements were open to the public (as is still the case now) in order to enrich the life of the community and the university.\n\n===Art in the First Decade===\nThe impetus behind the cultural renaissance in Chicago was the desire to improve society. For wealthy patrons, this aspiration drove philanthropy and the establishment of Chicago\u2019s most preeminent cultural and educational institutions. Similarly, the academics of The Renaissance Society wished to use their scholarly status to lead their community. Rather than take upon the duty of art education as non-professionals, they turned outward in the name of public service. The pervasive sense of idealism that underlies the Society undoubtedly excluded educating its community about modernism in its first decade of programming. The original tenets included a sense of morality to \u201cuplift humanity, a prescription that honored the art of the past, particularly that of the Renaissance, as well as the rigid aesthetic dictates of academic realism.\u201d<ref name=\"first history16\">{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=16}}</ref> To the academics, the modernists were radical in promoting self-expression in art-making rather. Thus, the Society attacked the artists of the early twentieth century avant-garde, \u201cbringing to the University some of the most beautiful things in the world.\u201d<ref name=\"first history16\" />\n\n===The Transition===\nIn 1927, Agnes C. Gale was elected president\u2014the first woman and non-academic to hold this post. In the first of a five annual exhibitions of modern French paintings, Gale included pieces by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Paul Gauguin]], who were originally maligned by the Armory Show. The shows proved popular, marked by a jump in membership during Gale\u2019s brief tenure. The Renaissance Society recruited the important photographer [[Eva Watson-Sch\u00fctze]] in the late 1920s to be president of the organization. She was elected in 1929 to become the Society\u2019s first full-time staff person as exhibition director. Sch\u00fctze made clear her progressive intent: \u201cPart of the program of The Renaissance Society is to stimulate study of the art of the present time, the new renaissance.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=22}}</ref>\n\n===The 1930s===\nThroughout the 1920s, modernism was scarce in the city. Only a handful of exhibitions and few commercial galleries displayed avant-garde works. In the dearth of progressive leadership, The Arts Club, under the direction of Rue Winterbotham Carpenter, became the Midwest center for the examination of twentieth century art. Sch\u00fctze knew Carpenter and The Renaissance Society began to exchange programs with The Arts Club. In the 1930-31 season, the Club brought [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] to Chicago to screen his film ''Le Ballet Mecanique'' and subsequently lent it to the Society.\n\nUnder Sch\u00fctze, The Renaissance Society expanded its curatorial programming into other art forms. The 1930 exhibition of modern American architecture was a pioneering example of a visual art institution investigating this art form. And In 1933, two film series were presented on campus: \u201cMovies of Today and Yesterday\u201d included D.W. Griffith\u2019s ''Birth of a Nation'' and ''The Brahms Symphony'', and \u201cforeign talking motion pictures\u201d included four works by French director Ren\u00e9 Clair. The Society\u2019s events also explored dance and music.\n\nIn the last years of Sch\u00fctze\u2019s leadership, curtailed by her failing health, the Society introduced Chicago\u2019s audience to avant-garde art that was seldom or never before seen before in the United States. Among the most groundbreaking exhibitions at The Renaissance Society, a solo show presenting Alexander Calder\u2019s early mobiles was his first in the country''. However, it was James Johnson Sweeney who presented the Society\u2019s boldest curatorial statements in his exhibition ''A Selection of Works by Twentieth-Century Artists. Non-representational works by seminal abstractionists\u2014[[Jean Arp]], [[Constantin Brancusi]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Jean Helion]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]\u2014were included in the comprehensive catalog of which much material had never before been exhibited in the country. Building on the founding principles of the Society, Sch\u00fctze initated a publishing program to expand the Society\u2019s role as \u201can independent, experimental laboratory for search of legitimate meaning in art.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=33}}</ref>\n\nIn her ultimate act as president of the Society, Sch\u00fctze organized the 1936 exhibition of L\u00e9ger, which she believed to be the institution's crowning achievement. The massive undertaking almost did not happen. In a feat of miscommunication, L\u00e9ger had sent a costly, unauthorized, and uninsured shipment of works with collect on delivery to the Society in March 1935.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=28}}</ref> Though Sweeney had met with L\u00e9ger in Paris the summer prior and explained that Sch\u00fctze had decided to hold a show for him, the exhibition date had not been set. Eva Watson Sch\u00fctze died before the plans were complete. Eventually, the show would open at The Renaissance Society and then travel to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and the [[Milwaukee Art Institute]], before L\u00e9ger was regarded as one of the most important abstractionists of his generation. Included in the exhibition was The City\u2014widely regarded as a revolutionary work from his mature period.\n\nAfter Sch\u00fctze\u2019s tenure, the Renaissance Society continued to pioneer groundbreaking exhibitions in her footsteps. In the 1936-37 season, \u2018\u2019Paintings and Sculpture by American Negro Artists\u2019\u2019 became the Society\u2019s first show to prominently feature African American artists. The next season, they showcased works by refugees from Europe in ''Paintings by Josef Albers and E. Misztrik de Monda''. In 1939, [[Laszlo Moholy-Nagy]], who had just moved to Chicago to direct The New Bauhaus (renamed the School of Design in Chicago, and then eventually the [[IIT Institute of Design]]), exhibited for the first time in America in the month-long show ''Paintings by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy''. A decade later, another great [[Bauhaus]] figure, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was then teaching at the Illinois Institute of Technology, was shown in an architecture exhibition at the Society. The following year, he personally installed an exhibition of ''Theo van Doesburg: Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, and Architectural Drawings''.\n\n===The War Years through the 60s===\nThe war years proved to be a prolific period for the Society. From 1941 to 1962, artist Francis Strain Beisel was director of the Renaissance Society, which became the \u201cpreeminent site for exhibitions in the Chicago area in the 1940s and 1950s.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=60}}</ref>  In 1939, the Society held the ''Exhibition of Hand-Woven Textiles'' produced by the Federal Art Project of Milwaukee; in 1940, ''Book Illustrations by Modern American Artists''; and three exhibitions in 1941: ''Fifteen American Sculptors and Contemporary American Lithographers'', the conceptually pioneering show of ''American Humor: Cartoons from the Late Nineteenth Century to the Present'', and ''Works by Chicago Artists Loaned by Chicago Collectors''. In October 1944, a second exhibition of African-American artists was held, organized out of the Hampton Institute and featured several artists then serving in the military. A significant show during this period was ''War Art'', which opened April 12, 1942. Locally organized, the exhibition particularly drew upon the School of Design\u2019s interest in practical art that responded to the present emergency.\n\nAfter the war, the Society did not exhibit New York artists who emerged in the late 1940s; instead, it showed [[Ben Shahn]] and [[I. Rice Pereira]]. The Society even ignored [[Pollock]] and [[de Kooning]] (who were already recognized as innovators) in its 1955 ''Eleven Pioneers of the Twentieth Century'', opting instead to include [[William Glackens]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Robert Henri]], [[John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. It was not until 1964 that [[Richard Lippold]] finally became the first New York artist to have a post-war solo exhibition at the Renaissance Society.\n\nLectures often accompanied exhibitions. Most notably in 1957, [[Marc Chagall]] gave his only American lecture. That same year, [[Leonard Bernstein]], in his newly minted stardom, did not appear at his talk until the very last moment to a large crowd. The Society invited [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\u2014who was incredibly expensive\u2014and Arnold Schoenberg among many others.\n\n===Conceptual Art===\n[[File:Renaissance Society.jpg.jpg|alt=exhibition at the Renaissance Society|thumb|308x308px|Felix Gonzalez-Torrez Exhibition at the Renaissance Society]]\n\tSusanne Ghez assumed role of Director in 1974. During her tenure, the Renaissance Society shifted its focus to \u201cConceptual Art.\u201d Beginning with its exhibition [[Joseph Kosuth]] in early 1976, the Society engaged in a discussion with contemporary art that rejected \u201ctraditional pictorial and sculptural definitions.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=106}}</ref>  In 1978, [[Lawrence Weiner]]\u2019s eponymous show contrasted Kosuth\u2019s approach by using language itself as material. Other artists exhibited during this period include Daniel Buren and John Knight.\n\nExhibitions at the Renaissance Society in the 90s shifted from the larger institutional critique that dominated the 70s and 80s to more inward contemplation through site-specificity. In 1990, both [[Michael Asher]] and [[Niele Toroni]] exhibited in solo shows. The following year, Jessica Stockholder opened the season with ''Skin Toned Garden Mapping''. Some significant artists who showed at the Renaissance Society in the 1990s include [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]] (1994), [[Kara Walker]] (1997), [[Kerry James Marshall ]](1998), and [[Raymond Pettibon]] (1998).\n\nThe Renaissance Society inaugurated the 21st century with ''[[Thomas Hirschhorn]]: World Airport''. In 2008, ''Black Is, Black Ain\u2019t'' explored a shift in the rhetoric of race and identity, exhibiting 26 black and non-black artists. After 40 years as Executive Director and Chief Curator of the Renaissance Society, Ghez ended her tenure in 2013 her final show ''[[William Pope.L]]: Forlesen''. Pope.L\u2019s new installation explored the demarcation of differences politically, economically, socially, and culturally. This show underscored Ghez\u2019s commitment to refocusing the Society around Sch\u00fctze\u2019s mission in becoming a laboratory for new art and ideas. Under her leadership the Renaissance Society developed an international distinction for its ground-breaking curatorial programming.\n\n===Today at the Ren===\nSolveig \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 assumed Ghez\u2019s position as Director of the Society in 2013. Previously at Bergen Kunsthall Norway, \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 has since overseen the curatorial efforts at the Society. With a renewed focus on commissioning new works, allowing artists to a have a space where they are able to create works not possible in more traditional art spaces, the Renaissance Society has been programming exhibitions, lectures, performances, and other formats.\n\nIn 2015, the Society celebrated its centennial. Matthias Poledna removed the overhead truss grid that had defined the gallery space, giving future artists more spatial freedom than in previous decades.\n\nHamza Walker was Associate Curator and Director of Education from 1994 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissancesociety.org/news/18/hamza-walker-appointed-executive-director-of-laxart/|title=Hamza Walker Appointed Executive Director of LAXART - News - The Renaissance Society|first=The Renaissance|last=Society|website=www.renaissancesociety.org}}</ref> He has been called by [[The New York Times]] one of the \"seven most influential curators in the country\", as well as \"one of the museum world's most talented essayists.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=The Curators: Discerning and Influential|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/arts/the-curators-discerning-and-influential.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 May 2001}}</ref>  Walker won the [[Ordway Prize]] in 2010, in recognition of his innovative curatorial work and his wide-ranging thinking and writing about contemporary art.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ise|first=Claudine|title=HAMZA WALKER WINS $100,000 ORDWAY PRIZE|url=http://badatsports.com/2010/hamza-walker-wins-100000-ordway-prize/|work=Bad at Sports|publisher=Bad at Sports|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, the Renaissance Society announced a $1 million gift from the Mansueto Foundation in support of its publications program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagobusiness.com/nonprofits-philanthropy/hyde-park-museum-gets-its-biggest-gift-ever-morningstar-founder|title=Hyde Park museum gets its biggest gift ever, from Morningstar founder|date=31 January 2019|website=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref> This gift secures the institution's publishing activities for 10 years and marks the largest single commitment in its history.\n\nIn April 2020 it was announced that [[Myriam Ben Salah]] would become the next executive director and chief curator of the Renaissance Society.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://renaissancesociety.org/news/46/announcing-myriam-ben-salah-as-executive-director-and-chief-curator/|title=ANNOUNCING MYRIAM BEN SALAH AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF CURATOR|work=Renaissance Society|access-date=2020-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Separation from the University==\n\tHaving been established by professors as a part of the University of Chicago community, the Renaissance Society has always had its roots in the academic community. Formally, the institution is The Renaissance Society \u2018at\u2019 the University of Chicago, highlighting its unique autonomy as a separate entity. In 1974, after operating under deficit debts financed by the University, the Renaissance Society was cut off financially. The University erased its debt and let the Society remain in the space rent-free; however, all financial help and benefits were rescinded. As a result, the Society became an independent non-collecting museum located on the campus.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.renaissancesociety.org/}}\n\n{{UChicago}}\n{{Museums in Chicago}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Renaissance Society, The}}\n[[Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago]]\n[[Category:University museums in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1915]]\n[[Category:1915 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the Philadelphia-based Academic Society|The Renaissance Society of America}}\n{{Infobox museum\n| name = The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago\n| logo = \n| image = Renaissance Society.jpg\n| imagesize = 300\n| map_type = \n| map_caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|41.7892|-87.6010|display=inline}}\n| former_name = \n| established = 1915\n| dissolved = \n| location = 5811 S.

Included in the exhibition was The City\u2014widely regarded as a revolutionary work from his mature period.\n\nAfter Sch\u00fctze\u2019s tenure, the Renaissance Society continued to pioneer groundbreaking exhibitions in her footsteps. In the 1936-37 season, \u2018\u2019Paintings and Sculpture by American Negro Artists\u2019\u2019 became the Society\u2019s first show to prominently feature African American artists. The next season, they showcased works by refugees from Europe in ''Paintings by Josef Albers and E. Misztrik de Monda''. In 1939, [[Laszlo Moholy-Nagy]], who had just moved to Chicago to direct The New Bauhaus (renamed the School of Design in Chicago, and then eventually the [[IIT Institute of Design]]), exhibited for the first time in America in the month-long show ''Paintings by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy''. A decade later, another great [[Bauhaus]] figure, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was then teaching at the Illinois Institute of Technology, was shown in an architecture exhibition at the Society. The following year, he personally installed an exhibition of ''Theo van Doesburg: Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, and Architectural Drawings''.\n\n===The War Years through the 60s===\nThe war years proved to be a prolific period for the Society. From 1941 to 1962, artist Francis Strain Beisel was director of the Renaissance Society, which became the \u201cpreeminent site for exhibitions in the Chicago area in the 1940s and 1950s.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=60}}</ref>  In 1939, the Society held the ''Exhibition of Hand-Woven Textiles'' produced by the Federal Art Project of Milwaukee; in 1940, ''Book Illustrations by Modern American Artists''; and three exhibitions in 1941: ''Fifteen American Sculptors and Contemporary American Lithographers'', the conceptually pioneering show of ''American Humor: Cartoons from the Late Nineteenth Century to the Present'', and ''Works by Chicago Artists Loaned by Chicago Collectors''. In October 1944, a second exhibition of African-American artists was held, organized out of the Hampton Institute and featured several artists then serving in the military. A significant show during this period was ''War Art'', which opened April 12, 1942. Locally organized, the exhibition particularly drew upon the School of Design\u2019s interest in practical art that responded to the present emergency.\n\nAfter the war, the Society did not exhibit New York artists who emerged in the late 1940s; instead, it showed [[Ben Shahn]] and [[I. Rice Pereira]]. The Society even ignored [[Pollock]] and [[de Kooning]] (who were already recognized as innovators) in its 1955 ''Eleven Pioneers of the Twentieth Century'', opting instead to include [[William Glackens]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Robert Henri]], [[John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. It was not until 1964 that [[Richard Lippold]] finally became the first New York artist to have a post-war solo exhibition at the Renaissance Society.\n\nLectures often accompanied exhibitions. Most notably in 1957, [[Marc Chagall]] gave his only American lecture. That same year, [[Leonard Bernstein]], in his newly minted stardom, did not appear at his talk until the very last moment to a large crowd. The Society invited [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\u2014who was incredibly expensive\u2014and Arnold Schoenberg among many others.\n\n===Conceptual Art===\n[[File:Renaissance Society.jpg.jpg|alt=exhibition at the Renaissance Society|thumb|308x308px|Felix Gonzalez-Torrez Exhibition at the Renaissance Society]]\n\tSusanne Ghez assumed role of Director in 1974. During her tenure, the Renaissance Society shifted its focus to \u201cConceptual Art.\u201d Beginning with its exhibition [[Joseph Kosuth]] in early 1976, the Society engaged in a discussion with contemporary art that rejected \u201ctraditional pictorial and sculptural definitions.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=106}}</ref>  In 1978, [[Lawrence Weiner]]\u2019s eponymous show contrasted Kosuth\u2019s approach by using language itself as material. Other artists exhibited during this period include Daniel Buren and John Knight.\n\nExhibitions at the Renaissance Society in the 90s shifted from the larger institutional critique that dominated the 70s and 80s to more inward contemplation through site-specificity. In 1990, both [[Michael Asher]] and [[Niele Toroni]] exhibited in solo shows. The following year, Jessica Stockholder opened the season with ''Skin Toned Garden Mapping''. Some significant artists who showed at the Renaissance Society in the 1990s include [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]] (1994), [[Kara Walker]] (1997), [[Kerry James Marshall ]](1998), and [[Raymond Pettibon]] (1998).\n\nThe Renaissance Society inaugurated the 21st century with ''[[Thomas Hirschhorn]]: World Airport''. In 2008, ''Black Is, Black Ain\u2019t'' explored a shift in the rhetoric of race and identity, exhibiting 26 black and non-black artists. After 40 years as Executive Director and Chief Curator of the Renaissance Society, Ghez ended her tenure in 2013 her final show ''[[William Pope.L]]: Forlesen''. Pope.L\u2019s new installation explored the demarcation of differences politically, economically, socially, and culturally. This show underscored Ghez\u2019s commitment to refocusing the Society around Sch\u00fctze\u2019s mission in becoming a laboratory for new art and ideas. Under her leadership the the Renaissance Society developed an international distinction for its ground-breaking curatorial programming.\n\n===Today at the Ren===\nSolveig \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 assumed Ghez\u2019s position as Director of the Society in 2013. Previously at Bergen Kunsthall Norway, \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 has since overseen the curatorial efforts at the Society. With a renewed focus on commissioning new works, allowing artists to a have a space where they are able to create works not possible in more traditional art spaces, the Renaissance Society has been programming exhibitions, lectures, performances, and other formats.\n\nIn 2015, the Society celebrated its centennial. Matthias Poledna removed the overhead truss grid that had defined the gallery space, giving future artists more spatial freedom than in previous decades.\n\nHamza Walker was Associate Curator and Director of Education from 1994 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissancesociety.org/news/18/hamza-walker-appointed-executive-director-of-laxart/|title=Hamza Walker Appointed Executive Director of LAXART - News - The Renaissance Society|first=The Renaissance|last=Society|website=www.renaissancesociety.org}}</ref> He has been called by [[The New York Times]] one of the \"seven most influential curators in the country\", as well as \"one of the museum world's most talented essayists.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=The Curators: Discerning and Influential|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/arts/the-curators-discerning-and-influential.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 May 2001}}</ref>  Walker won the [[Ordway Prize]] in 2010, in recognition of his innovative curatorial work and his wide-ranging thinking and writing about contemporary art.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ise|first=Claudine|title=HAMZA WALKER WINS $100,000 ORDWAY PRIZE|url=http://badatsports.com/2010/hamza-walker-wins-100000-ordway-prize/|work=Bad at Sports|publisher=Bad at Sports|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, the Renaissance Society announced a $1 million gift from the Mansueto Foundation in support of its publications program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagobusiness.com/nonprofits-philanthropy/hyde-park-museum-gets-its-biggest-gift-ever-morningstar-founder|title=Hyde Park museum gets its biggest gift ever, from Morningstar founder|date=31 January 2019|website=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref> This gift secures the institution's publishing activities for 10 years and marks the largest single commitment in its history.\n\nIn April 2020 it was announced that [[Myriam Ben Salah]] would become the next executive director and chief curator of the Renaissance Society.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://renaissancesociety.org/news/46/announcing-myriam-ben-salah-as-executive-director-and-chief-curator/|title=ANNOUNCING MYRIAM BEN SALAH AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF CURATOR|work=Renaissance Society|access-date=2020-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Separation from the University==\n\tHaving been established by professors as a part of the University of Chicago community, the Renaissance Society has always had its roots in the academic community. Formally, the institution is The Renaissance Society \u2018at\u2019 the University of Chicago, highlighting its unique autonomy as a separate entity. In 1974, after operating under deficit debts financed by the University, the Renaissance Society was cut off financially. The University erased its debt and let the Society remain in the space rent-free; however, all financial help and benefits were rescinded. As a result, the Society became an independent non-collecting museum located on the campus.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.renaissancesociety.org/}}\n\n{{UChicago}}\n{{Museums in Chicago}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Renaissance Society, The}}\n[[Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago]]\n[[Category:University museums in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1915]]\n[[Category:1915 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Society"}
