In an interview he said, \"I feel I am representing all Jews and all Israelis.\" He was the first spaceflight participant to request [[kosher]] food. He reportedly sought advice from a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] rabbi, Zvi Konikov, about how to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]] in space, as the period between sunrises in orbit is approximately 90 minutes.

A national team icon, a bronze statue of Moore is positioned at the entrance to [[Wembley Stadium]].\n\nA composed [[central defender]], Moore was best known for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1966, he was the first footballer to win the award and he remained the only one for a further 24 years. Moore was given an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[New Year Honours|New Year Honours List]]. He was made an inaugural inductee of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player and in the same year he was named in the BBC's list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].\n\n==Football career==\n\n===Early days===\n\n[[File:BOBBY MOORE - 43 Waverley Gardens Barking London IG11 0BH.jpg|thumb|upright|Moore's childhood home, 43 Waverley Gardens, Barking, London]]\nMoore was born in [[Municipal Borough of Barking|Barking]], [[Essex]]. He attended Westbury Primary School Barking,  and [[Tom Hood School]], [[Leytonstone]], playing football for both schools.<ref>Moore, Bobby (1966)'' My Soccer Story'' Stanley Paul & Co</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Moore joined West Ham United as a player and, after advancing through their youth set-up, he played his first game on 8 September 1958 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=477&united=Bobby_Moore|title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Bobby Moore|date= |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> In putting on the number six shirt, he replaced his mentor [[Malcolm Allison]], who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAllison never played another first team game for West Ham nor indeed any other First Division game as Moore became a regular. A composed [[central defender]], Moore was admired for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class.\n\nMoore was sent off once over the course of his West Ham career, for a foul on [[Dave Wagstaffe]] in the final moment of a match against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown his whistle for the offence and for full time. As [[Penalty card|red cards]] were not issued at that time, the dismissal didn't become apparent until after the match.<ref>{{cite book |title=Seeing Red for the Claret and Blue |first=John |last=Powles |publisher=SoccerData |location=Nottingham |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-905891-54-2 |page=18}}</ref>\n\nMoore also played [[cricket]] for the [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] youth team alongside fellow West Ham player [[Geoff Hurst]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/208547.html |title=Test centuries against all nations, and plain sailing |publisher=www.cricinfo.com |date=2 May 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===An England star, a European winner===\nIn 1960, Moore earned a call up to the [[England national under-23 football team|England Under-23]] squad. His form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned him a late call-up to the [[England national football team|full England squad]] by [[Walter Winterbottom]] and [[The Football Association]] selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's [[FIFA World Cup 1962|World Cup]] finals in [[Chile]]. Moore was uncapped as he flew to [[South America]] with the rest of the squad, but made his d\u00e9but on 20 May 1962 in England's final pre-tournament friendly&nbsp;\u2013 a 4\u20130 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in [[Lima]]. Also d\u00e9buting that day was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] defender [[Maurice Norman]]. Both proved so impressive that they stayed in the team for the whole of England's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter finals at [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]].\n\n[[File:Bobby Moore vs Josef Masopust 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Moore (left) vs. [[Josef Masopust]] at the [[1963 England v Rest of the World football match]].]]\nOn 29 May 1963, 22-year-old Moore captained his country for the first time in just his 12th appearance after the retirement of [[Johnny Haynes]] and an injury to his successor, [[Jimmy Armfield]]. He was the youngest man ever to captain England at the highest level. England defeated [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 4\u20132 in the game and Armfield returned to the role of captain afterwards, but new coach [[Alf Ramsey]] gave Moore the job permanently during a series of summer friendlies in 1964, organised because England had failed to reach the latter stages of the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]].\n\n1964 turned out to be quite an eventful year for Moore. As well as gaining the England captaincy, he lifted the [[FA Cup]] as West Ham defeated [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3\u20132 in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], courtesy of a last-minute goal from [[Ronnie Boyce]]. On a personal level, Moore also was successfully treated for [[testicular cancer]] and was named the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]].\n\nThe FA Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for Moore. In 1965, he lifted the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] after West Ham defeated [[1860 Munich]] 2\u20130 in the final with both goals coming from [[Alan Sealey]]. By now he was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the [[FIFA World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]].\n\n1966 had a mixed start for Moore. In January, he scored his first England goal in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at [[Goodison Park]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Hankin|first=Alex|title=Send in the clown: England's colourful history of matches against Poland|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-v-poland-down-the-years-1379070|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=Daily Mirror|location=London|date=14 October 2012}}</ref> but two months later captained West Ham to the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]&nbsp;\u2013 in its last season before its transfer to Wembley as a one-off final&nbsp;\u2013 which they lost 5\u20133 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. For Moore, who had scored in the first leg, and his West Ham teammates [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Martin Peters]], considerable consolation lay ahead. Moore scored his second and ultimately final England goal in a friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], two weeks before the World Cup would begin.\n\n===World Cup===\n{{Main|1966 FIFA World Cup}}\n\n[[File:England germany entering pitch.jpg|thumb|right|Bobby Moore (far right) leading the England team out on to the pitch to play the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]] against West Germany at Wembley Stadium]]\nOn the verge of his greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Moore wanted to leave West Ham. Moore had let his contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of [[Alf Ramsey|Sir Alf Ramsey]] and realisation he was technically ineligible to play, did he re-sign with West Ham to allow him to captain the England team of 1966. Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] to England's hotel and told the two of them to resolve their differences and get a contract signed up. Moore was the leader of the [[History of the England national football team#1966 World Cup champions|World Cup winning side]] and established himself as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all their games at Wembley, England had got through their group with little trouble, they then beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in their quarter final and a [[Eus\u00e9bio]]-led [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] team in the semi-finals. [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] awaited in the final.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n\n[[File:The Queen presents the 1966 World Cup to England Captain, Bobby Moore. (7936243534).jpg|thumb|left|The Queen presents the 1966 [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] to England captain Moore]]\nAccording to Geoff Hurst's [[autobiography]], England full back [[George Cohen]] overheard Ramsey talking to his coaching staff about the possibility of dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter&nbsp;\u2013 who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps&nbsp;\u2013 was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, [[Jack Charlton]].\n\n[[File:Champions statue.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[World Cup Sculpture]]'' featuring Moore with the World Cup trophy, on the shoulders of [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], together with [[Martin Peters]]]]\nIn the final, England went 1\u20130 down through [[Helmut Haller]], but Moore's awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. He was fouled by [[Wolfgang Overath]] midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, he picked himself up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Hurst's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Hurst scored.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n\nThe West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Peters scored to take England 2\u20131 up, but the Germans equalised in the final minute of normal time through [[Wolfgang Weber]]&nbsp;\u2013 as Moore appealed unsuccessfully for a [[Handball (soccer)|handball]] decision&nbsp;\u2013 to take the match into extra time.\n\nRamsey was convinced the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final#Controversial third England goal in extra time|scored a controversial and heavily debated goal]], the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore on the edge of his own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">40&nbsp;yards&nbsp;(40&nbsp;m)</span> upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4\u20132.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n\nOf many memorable images from that day, one is of Moore wiping his hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as she presented him with the [[Jules Rimet trophy]] (World Cup).

He was awarded the coveted [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] title at the end of 1966, the first footballer to do so, and remaining the only one for a further 24 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Different_eras,_both_great_figures&in_article_id=533469&in_page_id=43|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804122815/http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Different_eras,_both_great_figures&in_article_id=533469&in_page_id=43|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2012|title=Different eras, both great figures|last=Griffiths|first=Danny|date=12 February 2009|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref> He was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.\n\nMoore's image and popularity allowed him to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham's ground, [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], and he also appeared with his wife Tina, along with Peters and his wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to ''\"Look in at the local\"''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/detail/43768/1/TV-Advert-Grab/Look-in-at-the-local/1960s|title=The Advertising Archives &#124; TV Advert Grab &#124; Look in at the local &#124; 1960s|website=www.advertisingarchives.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nHe continued to play for West Ham and England, earning his 50th cap in a 5\u20131 win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the [[1968 European Football Championship|1968 European Championships]]. England ultimately reached the semi-finals (the tournament was just a four-team event) where they played [[Yugoslavian national football team|Yugoslavia]] in [[Florence]] and lost 1\u20130. England, as champions, did not have to qualify for the next World Cup, and Moore remained the first name on Ramsey's team sheet, winning his 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to [[South America]] for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in [[Mexico]].\n\n===1970===\n{{further|Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet}}\nThe year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for Moore. Retained as captain for the [[FIFA World Cup 1970|1970 World Cup]], there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate Moore in the [[theft]] of a [[bracelet]] from a [[jeweller]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Moore had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for it. While Moore had been in the shop (having entered with [[Bobby Charlton]] to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Moore was arrested and then released. He then travelled with the England team to play another match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in [[Quito]]. He played, winning his 80th cap, and England were 2\u20130 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Moore was detained and placed under four days of [[house arrest]]. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and an exonerated Moore returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. Moore received a guard of honour from his squad when he arrived at the team hotel.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n{{quote box\n |quote = By common consent, Bobby Moore's greatest game was the fabled [[1970 FIFA World Cup Group 3#Brazil vs England|1970 World Cup group match against Brazil]] in Guadalajara.

At the end of the year, Moore was voted runner-up (behind [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] of West Germany) for the 1970 [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/a/Ballon-D-Wouldor-Winners.htm | title=Ballon d'or winners | publisher=World od soccer | accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Final years at the top===\n\nOn 10 August 1970, Moore received an anonymous threat to kidnap his wife and hold her to a \u00a310,000 ransom. This caused him to pull out of pre-season friendlies against [[Bristol City]] and [[Bournemouth]]. However, his services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against [[Glasgow Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at the end of 1970.\n\nAlthough Moore was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the game, he was not without his faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, [[Jimmy Greaves]], [[Brian Dear]] and [[Clyde Best]], were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The [[nightclub]] in [[Blackpool]] was owned by Moore's friend, [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Brian London]]. West Ham lost the tie 4\u20130. They were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of [[Division One|Division one]] at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Moore was featured on TV as the subject on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' the night before. [[Brian Glanville]] stated that it was not uncommon for Moore to drink heavily, but he was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] he had consumed the night before.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glanville|first=Brian|title=The real Bobby Moore|url=http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss2839/stories/20050924000907700.htm|publisher=www.sportsstronthenet.com|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nMoore surpassed West Ham's appearances record in 1973 when he played for the club for the 509th time. Three days earlier, on [[Valentine's Day]] 1973, he won his 100th cap for England in a comprehensive 5\u20130 win over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=467|title=englandstats.com &#124; 467 - Scotland\u00a00-5\u00a0England, Wednesday, 14th February 1973|website=englandstats.com}}</ref> By this stage, only Peters and [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] from the 1966 squad were also still involved with the England team. Later the same year, Moore was exposed defensively by [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in a qualifier for the [[FIFA World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]] in [[Chorz\u00f3w]], deflecting a free kick past goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] to put the home side ahead, and then losing possession to [[Wlodzimierz Lubanski]], who scored the second.\n\nMoore's form had dipped enough for Ramsey to choose not to select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in defense and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant he was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: \"Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year.\" It never happened, as England could only draw 1\u20131. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorz\u00f3w, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper [[Jan Tomaszewski]] blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When [[Kevin Hector]] finally did come on for [[Martin Chivers]] after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to [[David Miller (editor)|David Miller]] \"you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch.\" Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken.  England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager as he was sacked six months later.\n\nMoore won his 108th and final cap in the next game, a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 14 November 1973. He became England's most capped player, beating Bobby Charlton's record by two appearances, and equalled [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]]'s record of 90 appearances as captain. [[Peter Shilton]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] have since overtaken the caps record, but the joint captaincy record remains.\n\n===After West Ham and England===\nMoore played his last game for West Ham in an FA Cup tie against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in January 1974. He was injured in the match. On 14 March the same year, he was allowed to leave West Ham after more than 15 years, taking with him the club record for appearances (since overtaken by [[Billy Bonds]]) and the most international caps for an outfield player.\n\nHe joined London rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], who were in the [[Football League Championship|Second Division]], for \u00a325,000. During Moore's first season there they defeated West Ham in a League Cup tie and then reached the [[FA Cup Final 1975|FA Cup Final]] where they faced West Ham again. This time Fulham lost the game, 2\u20130, and Moore had made his final appearance at Wembley as a professional player.\n\nMoore played his final professional game in England for Fulham on 14 May 1977 against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He played for two teams in the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|North American Soccer League]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[San Antonio Thunder]] in 1976 (24 games, 1 goal) and [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] in 1978 (7 games). During 1976, there was also a final appearance on the international field for Team USA in games against Italy, Brazil and an England team captained by [[Gerry Francis]]. This was the [[1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament|U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament]], which capitalised on NASL and more importantly England and Italy both failing to qualify for the [[1976 European Football Championship|European Championships that year]]. In April 1978 he signed his very last contract as a professional player, when he joined [[Denmark|Danish]] side [[Herning Fremad]] to promote Danish football's new transition to professional football, playing 9 games for the club before he retired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herningfremad.dk/default.asp?id=38&h=37 |title=Historie |publisher=Herningfremad.dk |accessdate=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124512/http://www.herningfremad.dk/default.asp?id=38&h=37 |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Moore appeared in 8 games for the now-defunct [[Carolina Lightnin']], after injuries left the club without cover.<ref>{{cite web|title=East End to NC end: The final playing days of West Ham legend Bobby Moore|url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/east-end-to-nc-end-the-final-playing-days-of-west-ham-legend-bobby-moore/15843646/|publisher=WRALSportsFan.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Post-football career==\nMoore retired from playing professionally in 1978, and had a short relatively unsuccessful spell in football management at [[Eastern AA]] in [[Hong Kong]], [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. Moore publicly supported [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 General Election.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mercury |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2010/01/31/the-celebrity-friends-of-margaret-thatcher-66331-25740208/ |title=The celebrity friends of Margaret Thatcher |work=Birmingham Mail |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe became manager of Southend United in 1984. In his first full season, 1984\u201385, Southend narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election to the Football League amid severe financial difficulties. However, the side was gradually rebuilt and in the 1985\u201386 season Southend started well and were in the promotion race until the new year before eventually finishing 9th. His successor, [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]] built upon those foundations to win promotion the following year.

Three days later, he commentated on an England match against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] at Wembley, alongside his friend [[Jonathan Pearce]]. That was to be his final public appearance; seven days later on 24 February, at 6:36&nbsp;am, he died at the age of 51.\n\n[[File:City of London Cemetery - Bobby Moore grave plaque in the Memorial Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|Moore's grave in the Memorial Gardens, City of London Cemetery]]\nHe was the first member of the England World Cup winning side to die, the second being [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] 14 years later.

[[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]] died in May 2018, as did [[Gordon Banks]] in February 2019 and [[Martin Peters]] in December 2019. Bobby Moore's funeral was held on 2 March 1993 at [[Putney Vale Cemetery|Putney Vale crematorium]] and his ashes were buried in a plot at [[City of London Cemetery and Crematorium]] with his father, Robert Edward Moore (who died in 1978) and his mother, Doris Joyce Moore, who had died only the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=7348504&PIpi=21561444 |title=Bobby Moore (1941\u20131993) \u2013 Find A Grave Photos |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first West Ham home game after his death was on 6 March 1993, against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

A national team icon, a bronze statue of Moore is positioned at the entrance to [[Wembley Stadium]].\n\nA composed [[central defender]], Moore was best known for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1966, he was the first footballer to win the award and he remained the only one for a further 24 years. Moore was given an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[New Year Honours|New Year Honours List]]. He was made an inaugural inductee of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player and in the same year he was named in the BBC's list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].\n\n==Football career==\n\n===Early days===\n\n[[File:BOBBY MOORE - 43 Waverley Gardens Barking London IG11 0BH.jpg|thumb|upright|Moore's childhood home, 43 Waverley Gardens, Barking, London]]\nMoore was born in [[Municipal Borough of Barking|Barking]], [[Essex]]. He attended Westbury Primary School Barking,  and [[Tom Hood School]], [[Leytonstone]], playing football for both schools.<ref>Moore, Bobby (1966)'' My Soccer Story'' Stanley Paul & Co</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Moore joined West Ham United as a player and, after advancing through their youth set-up, he played his first game on 8 September 1958 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=477&united=Bobby_Moore|title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Bobby Moore|date= |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> In putting on the number six shirt, he replaced his mentor [[Malcolm Allison]], who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAllison never played another first team game for West Ham nor indeed any other First Division game as Moore became a regular. A composed [[central defender]], Moore was admired for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class.\n\nMoore was sent off once over the course of his West Ham career, for a foul on [[Dave Wagstaffe]] in the final moment of a match against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown his whistle for the offence and for full time. As [[Penalty card|red cards]] were not issued at that time, the dismissal didn't become apparent until after the match.<ref>{{cite book |title=Seeing Red for the Claret and Blue |first=John |last=Powles |publisher=SoccerData |location=Nottingham |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-905891-54-2 |page=18}}</ref>\n\nMoore also played [[cricket]] for the [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] youth team alongside fellow West Ham player [[Geoff Hurst]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/208547.html |title=Test centuries against all nations, and plain sailing |publisher=www.cricinfo.com |date=2 May 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===An England star, a European winner===\nIn 1960, Moore earned a call up to the [[England national under-23 football team|England Under-23]] squad. His form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned him a late call-up to the [[England national football team|full England squad]] by [[Walter Winterbottom]] and [[The Football Association]] selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's [[FIFA World Cup 1962|World Cup]] finals in [[Chile]]. Moore was uncapped as he flew to [[South America]] with the rest of the squad, but made his d\u00e9but on 20 May 1962 in England's final pre-tournament friendly&nbsp;\u2013 a 4\u20130 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in [[Lima]]. Also d\u00e9buting that day was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] defender [[Maurice Norman]]. Both proved so impressive that they stayed in the team for the whole of England's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter finals at [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]].\n\n[[File:Bobby Moore vs Josef Masopust 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Moore (left) vs. [[Josef Masopust]] at the [[1963 England v Rest of the World football match]].]]\nOn 29 May 1963, 22-year-old Moore captained his country for the first time in just his 12th appearance after the retirement of [[Johnny Haynes]] and an injury to his successor, [[Jimmy Armfield]]. He was the youngest man ever to captain England at the highest level. England defeated [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 4\u20132 in the game and Armfield returned to the role of captain afterwards, but new coach [[Alf Ramsey]] gave Moore the job permanently during a series of summer friendlies in 1964, organised because England had failed to reach the latter stages of the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]].\n\n1964 turned out to be quite an eventful year for Moore. As well as gaining the England captaincy, he lifted the [[FA Cup]] as West Ham defeated [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3\u20132 in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], courtesy of a last-minute goal from [[Ronnie Boyce]]. On a personal level, Moore also was successfully treated for [[testicular cancer]] and was named the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]].\n\nThe FA Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for Moore. In 1965, he lifted the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] after West Ham defeated [[1860 Munich]] 2\u20130 in the final with both goals coming from [[Alan Sealey]]. By now he was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the [[FIFA World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]].\n\n1966 had a mixed start for Moore. In January, he scored his first England goal in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at [[Goodison Park]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Hankin|first=Alex|title=Send in the clown: England's colourful history of matches against Poland|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-v-poland-down-the-years-1379070|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=Daily Mirror|location=London|date=14 October 2012}}</ref> but two months later captained West Ham to the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]&nbsp;\u2013 in its last season before its transfer to Wembley as a one-off final&nbsp;\u2013 which they lost 5\u20133 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. For Moore, who had scored in the first leg, and his West Ham teammates [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Martin Peters]], considerable consolation lay ahead. Moore scored his second and ultimately final England goal in a friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], two weeks before the World Cup would begin.\n\n===World Cup===\n{{Main|1966 FIFA World Cup}}\n\n[[File:England germany entering pitch.jpg|thumb|right|Bobby Moore (far right) leading the England team out on to the pitch to play the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]] against West Germany at Wembley Stadium]]\nOn the verge of his greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Moore wanted to leave West Ham. Moore had let his contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of [[Alf Ramsey|Sir Alf Ramsey]] and realisation he was technically ineligible to play, did he re-sign with West Ham to allow him to captain the England team of 1966. Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] to England's hotel and told the two of them to resolve their differences and get a contract signed up. Moore was the leader of the [[History of the England national football team#1966 World Cup champions|World Cup winning side]] and established himself as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all their games at Wembley, England had got through their group with little trouble, they then beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in their quarter final and a [[Eus\u00e9bio]]-led [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] team in the semi-finals. [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] awaited in the final.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n\n[[File:The Queen presents the 1966 World Cup to England Captain, Bobby Moore. (7936243534).jpg|thumb|left|The Queen presents the 1966 [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] to England captain Moore]]\nAccording to Geoff Hurst's [[autobiography]], England full back [[George Cohen]] overheard Ramsey talking to his coaching staff about the possibility of dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter&nbsp;\u2013 who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps&nbsp;\u2013 was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, [[Jack Charlton]].\n\n[[File:Champions statue.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[World Cup Sculpture]]'' featuring Moore with the World Cup trophy, on the shoulders of [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], together with [[Martin Peters]]]]\nIn the final, England went 1\u20130 down through [[Helmut Haller]], but Moore's awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. He was fouled by [[Wolfgang Overath]] midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, he picked himself up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Hurst's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Hurst scored.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n\nThe West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Peters scored to take England 2\u20131 up, but the Germans equalised in the final minute of normal time through [[Wolfgang Weber]]&nbsp;\u2013 as Moore appealed unsuccessfully for a [[Handball (soccer)|handball]] decision&nbsp;\u2013 to take the match into extra time.\n\nRamsey was convinced the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final#Controversial third England goal in extra time|scored a controversial and heavily debated goal]], the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore on the edge of his own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">40&nbsp;yards&nbsp;(40&nbsp;m)</span> upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4\u20132.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n\nOf many memorable images from that day, one is of Moore wiping his hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as she presented him with the [[Jules Rimet trophy]] (World Cup).

He was awarded the coveted [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] title at the end of 1966, the first footballer to do so, and remaining the only one for a further 24 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Different_eras,_both_great_figures&in_article_id=533469&in_page_id=43|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804122815/http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Different_eras,_both_great_figures&in_article_id=533469&in_page_id=43|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2012|title=Different eras, both great figures|last=Griffiths|first=Danny|date=12 February 2009|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref> He was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.\n\nMoore's image and popularity allowed him to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham's ground, [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], and he also appeared with his wife Tina, along with Peters and his wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to ''\"Look in at the local\"''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/detail/43768/1/TV-Advert-Grab/Look-in-at-the-local/1960s|title=The Advertising Archives &#124; TV Advert Grab &#124; Look in at the local &#124; 1960s|website=www.advertisingarchives.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nHe continued to play for West Ham and England, earning his 50th cap in a 5\u20131 win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the [[1968 European Football Championship|1968 European Championships]]. England ultimately reached the semi-finals (the tournament was just a four-team event) where they played [[Yugoslavian national football team|Yugoslavia]] in [[Florence]] and lost 1\u20130. England, as champions, did not have to qualify for the next World Cup, and Moore remained the first name on Ramsey's team sheet, winning his 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to [[South America]] for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in [[Mexico]].\n\n===1970===\n{{further|Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet}}\nThe year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for Moore. Retained as captain for the [[FIFA World Cup 1970|1970 World Cup]], there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate Moore in the [[theft]] of a [[bracelet]] from a [[jeweller]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Moore had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for it. While Moore had been in the shop (having entered with [[Bobby Charlton]] to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Moore was arrested and then released. He then travelled with the England team to play another match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in [[Quito]]. He played, winning his 80th cap, and England were 2\u20130 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Moore was detained and placed under four days of [[house arrest]]. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and an exonerated Moore returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. Moore received a guard of honour from his squad when he arrived at the team hotel.<ref name=\"Hugh Mc\"/>\n{{quote box\n |quote = By common consent, Bobby Moore's greatest game was the fabled [[1970 FIFA World Cup Group 3#Brazil vs England|1970 World Cup group match against Brazil]] in Guadalajara.

On 2 June he captained England to a 1\u20130 victory against Romania.

At the end of the year, Moore was voted runner-up (behind [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] of West Germany) for the 1970 [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/a/Ballon-D-Wouldor-Winners.htm | title=Ballon d'or winners | publisher=World od soccer | accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Final years at the top===\n\nOn 10 August 1970, Moore received an anonymous threat to kidnap his wife and hold her to a \u00a310,000 ransom. This caused him to pull out of pre-season friendlies against [[Bristol City]] and [[Bournemouth]]. However, his services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against [[Glasgow Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at the end of 1970.\n\nAlthough Moore was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the game, he was not without his faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, [[Jimmy Greaves]], [[Brian Dear]] and [[Clyde Best]], were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The [[nightclub]] in [[Blackpool]] was owned by Moore's friend, [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Brian London]]. West Ham lost the tie 4\u20130. They were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of [[Division One|Division one]] at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Moore was featured on TV as the subject on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' the night before. [[Brian Glanville]] stated that it was not uncommon for Moore to drink heavily, but he was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] he had consumed the night before.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glanville|first=Brian|title=The real Bobby Moore|url=http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss2839/stories/20050924000907700.htm|publisher=www.sportsstronthenet.com|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nMoore surpassed West Ham's appearances record in 1973 when he played for the club for the 509th time. Three days earlier, on [[Valentine's Day]] 1973, he won his 100th cap for England in a comprehensive 5\u20130 win over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=467|title=englandstats.com &#124; 467 - Scotland\u00a00-5\u00a0England, Wednesday, 14th February 1973|website=englandstats.com}}</ref> By this stage, only Peters and [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] from the 1966 squad were also still involved with the England team. Later the same year, Moore was exposed defensively by [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in a qualifier for the [[FIFA World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]] in [[Chorz\u00f3w]], deflecting a free kick past goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] to put the home side ahead, and then losing possession to [[Wlodzimierz Lubanski]], who scored the second.\n\nMoore's form had dipped enough for Ramsey to choose not to select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in defense and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant he was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: \"Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year.\" It never happened, as England could only draw 1\u20131. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorz\u00f3w, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper [[Jan Tomaszewski]] blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When [[Kevin Hector]] finally did come on for [[Martin Chivers]] after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to [[David Miller (editor)|David Miller]] \"you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch.\" Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken.  England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager as he was sacked six months later.\n\nMoore won his 108th and final cap in the next game, a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 14 November 1973. He became England's most capped player, beating Bobby Charlton's record by two appearances, and equalled [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]]'s record of 90 appearances as captain. [[Peter Shilton]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] have since overtaken the caps record, but the joint captaincy record remains.\n\n===After West Ham and England===\nMoore played his last game for West Ham in an FA Cup tie against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in January 1974. He was injured in the match. On 14 March the same year, he was allowed to leave West Ham after more than 15 years, taking with him the club record for appearances (since overtaken by [[Billy Bonds]]) and the most international caps for an outfield player.\n\nHe joined London rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], who were in the [[Football League Championship|Second Division]], for \u00a325,000. During Moore's first season there they defeated West Ham in a League Cup tie and then reached the [[FA Cup Final 1975|FA Cup Final]] where they faced West Ham again. This time Fulham lost the game, 2\u20130, and Moore had made his final appearance at Wembley as a professional player.\n\nMoore played his final professional game in England for Fulham on 14 May 1977 against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He played for two teams in the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|North American Soccer League]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[San Antonio Thunder]] in 1976 (24 games, 1 goal) and [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] in 1978 (7 games). During 1976, there was also a final appearance on the international field for Team USA in games against Italy, Brazil and an England team captained by [[Gerry Francis]]. This was the [[1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament|U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament]], which capitalised on NASL and more importantly England and Italy both failing to qualify for the [[1976 European Football Championship|European Championships that year]]. In April 1978 he signed his very last contract as a professional player, when he joined [[Denmark|Danish]] side [[Herning Fremad]] to promote Danish football's new transition to professional football, playing 9 games for the club before he retired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herningfremad.dk/default.asp?id=38&h=37 |title=Historie |publisher=Herningfremad.dk |accessdate=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124512/http://www.herningfremad.dk/default.asp?id=38&h=37 |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Moore appeared in 8 games for the now-defunct [[Carolina Lightnin']], after injuries left the club without cover.<ref>{{cite web|title=East End to NC end: The final playing days of West Ham legend Bobby Moore|url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/east-end-to-nc-end-the-final-playing-days-of-west-ham-legend-bobby-moore/15843646/|publisher=WRALSportsFan.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Post-football career==\nMoore retired from playing professionally in 1978, and had a short relatively unsuccessful spell in football management at [[Eastern AA]] in [[Hong Kong]], [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].

Several cryptographic systems employed by the U.S. government and military have used his algorithms for such purposes as nuclear command and control, tactical voice communications, and network security.<ref name=\"crtome\">{{cite web|title=The Calyx Institute: Privacy by design for everyone|url=https://cryptome.org/2014/10/pre-snowden.pdf|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref>  As a technical person with high managerial responsibilities, \n{{Quote|\n...he advised senior management on the strengths and shortfalls of the technology they were using, as well as identifying emerging technologies, spotting technical gaps or risks in new systems and services, and identifying old products for withdrawal from service.<ref name=\"teleg\"/>}}\n\n==ECC and AES==\n[[Neal Koblitz]] and [[Alfred Menezes]] have written that Snow was a strong supporter of the transition from [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] to [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography]] (ECC) as a public key cryptographic technology: \n{{Quote|\n...ECC started to get strong support from the NSA's Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) during the time when Snow was the technical director and Mike Jacobs was the head of IAD. There has never been any evidence -- in the reports on the Snowden documents or anywhere else -- of any actions by Snow and Jacobs or their researchers that would weaken or undermine cryptographic standards. On the contrary, during that period IAD cooperated with other sectors in pushing for strong security. This was consistent with IAD's mission as the defensive arm of the NSA. (The offensive arm, called SIGINT, is another matter.)<ref>{{citation|last1=Koblitz|first1=Neal|last2=Menezes|first2=Alfred J.|title=A riddle wrapped in an enigma|journal=IEEE Security & Privacy|volume=14|issue=6|year=2016|pages=34\u201342|doi=10.1109/MSP.2016.120}}</ref>}}\n\nCybersecurity policy expert [[Susan Landau]] attributes the NSA's harmonious collaboration with industry and academia in the selection of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) in 2000 \u2014 and the Agency's support for the choice of a strong encryption algorithm designed by Europeans rather than by Americans \u2014 in part to Snow, who represented the NSA as cochairman of the Technical Working Group for the AES competition.<ref>{{citation|last=Landau|first=Susan|title=NSA and Dual EC_DRBG: Deja vu all over again?|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=37|issue=4|year=2015|pages=72\u201383|doi=10.1007/s00283-015-9543-z}}</ref>{{rp|75}}\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001]], the NSA believed that it had public support for a dramatic expansion of its surveillance activities.<ref name=\"teleg\">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Sophie|title=Ex-NSA technical chief: How 9/11 created the surveillance state|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=13 November 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11221287/Ex-NSA-technical-chief-How-911-created-the-surveillance-state.html}}</ref>\nAccording to Koblitz and Menezes, the period when the NSA was a trusted partner with academia and industry in the development of cryptographic standards came to an end when, as part of the change in the NSA in the post-September 11 era, Snow was replaced as Technical Director and could no longer effectively oppose proposed actions by the offensive arm of the NSA:\n\n{{Quote|\nIn 2002 Brian Snow was moved from the technical directorship of IAD to a different\nposition within the NSA that had high status but little influence, particularly with regard\nto actions that were being proposed by SIGINT; Mike Jacobs retired from the NSA the\nsame year.<ref>{{citation|last1=Koblitz|first1=Neal|last2=Menezes|first2=Alfred J.|title=A riddle wrapped in an enigma|journal=IEEE Security & Privacy|volume=14|issue=6|year=2016|pages=34\u201342|doi=10.1109/MSP.2016.120}} Footnote 9 in the full version, see {{cite web|title=A riddle wrapped in an enigma|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf|access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n==Code of ethics==\nIn Snow's last years at the NSA before his retirement in 2006, along with Clinton Brooks he led a group that drew up a draft ethics code for intelligence officers.<ref>{{citation|last1=Snow|first1=Brian|last2=Brooks|first2=Clinton|title=Privacy and security: An ethics code for U.S. intelligence officers |journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=52|issue=8|year=2009|pages=30\u201332|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536630}}</ref>\n\nSince retiring from the NSA, Snow has worked as a security and ethics consultant.

Following the [[Soviet submarine S-363|sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine]] deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite [[Soviet Union|the Soviets]] consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The [[Swedish submarine incidents|\"submarine hunts\"]], which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of \"evidence\" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine ''\"Vetenskapens v\u00e4rld\"'' (\"World of science\") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly \"submarine hunts\" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate H\u00e5kan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in [[Swedish krona|SEK]].<ref name=Staff>Aired 16 April 2012. \"[http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb,a1364145,1,f,-1/pb,a1364142,1,f,-1/pl,v,,2781791/sb,p102815,1,f,-1 SVT Vetenskapens V\u00e4rld: \"Ig Nobel\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427065553/http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb%2Ca1364145%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpb%2Ca1364142%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpl%2Cv%2C%2C2781791%2Fsb%2Cp102815%2C1%2Cf%2C-1 |date=27 April 2012}}\" (in Swedish).

Following the [[Soviet submarine S-363|sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine]] deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite [[Soviet Union|the Soviets]] consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The [[Swedish submarine incidents|\"submarine hunts\"]], which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of \"evidence\" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine ''\"Vetenskapens v\u00e4rld\"'' (\"World of science\") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly \"submarine hunts\" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate H\u00e5kan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in [[Swedish krona|SEK]].<ref name=Staff>Aired 16 April 2012. \"[http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb,a1364145,1,f,-1/pb,a1364142,1,f,-1/pl,v,,2781791/sb,p102815,1,f,-1 SVT Vetenskapens V\u00e4rld: \"Ig Nobel\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427065553/http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb%2Ca1364145%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpb%2Ca1364142%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpl%2Cv%2C%2C2781791%2Fsb%2Cp102815%2C1%2Cf%2C-1 |date=27 April 2012}}\" (in Swedish).
