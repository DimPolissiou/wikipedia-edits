It was named after the [[Sunset Boulevard|thoroughfare with the same name]] that runs through [[Los Angeles]] and [[Beverly Hills, California]].\n\nThe film stars [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis, a struggling [[screenwriter]], and [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond, a former [[silent-film]] star who draws him into her demented fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. [[Erich von Stroheim]] plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and [[Nancy Olson]], [[Jack Webb]], [[Lloyd Gough]], and [[Fred Clark]] appear in supporting roles. Director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and [[gossip columnist]] [[Hedda Hopper]] play themselves, and the film includes [[cameo appearance]]s by leading silent-film actors [[Buster Keaton]], [[H. B. Warner]], and [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].\n\nPraised by many [[Film critic|critics]] when first released, ''Sunset Boulevard'' was nominated for 11 [[Academy Awards]] (including nominations in [[List of films with all four Academy Award acting nominations|all four acting categories]]) and won three. It is currently ranked among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest movies ever made]]. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] in 1989, ''Sunset Boulevard'' was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. In 1998, it was ranked number 12 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Movies|100 best American films]] of the 20th century, and in 2007, it was 16th on their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary list]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT, should be 400 to 700 words-->\n<!--This 20140426 version of the plot summary comes in at 696 actual visible words, treating hyphens as spaces. WP:FILMPLOT specifies 700 max as standard but allows exceptions. This is not an article about a recent blockbuster suffering from a surfeit of fanboys piling on trivial plot details. It is about a top-tier classic film (e.g.,#12 on AFI's \"100 Greatest\" list in 1998) and presentable text quality is more important than an exact word count. Wikipedia will not explode if it swells back up to 800 again in the future. Any necessary pruning should be done thoughtfully and by editors very familiar with this film. Please do not leave an unsightly aftermath of fractured prose in your wake or blindly revert confusing or inaccurate statements back into existence.-->\nAt a mansion on [[Sunset Boulevard]], the body of Joe Gillis floats in the swimming pool. In a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Joe relates the events leading to his death.\n\nSix months earlier, down-on-his-luck [[screenwriting|screenwriter]] Joe tries selling [[Paramount Pictures]] producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. [[Script coverage|Script reader]] Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from [[repossession]] men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman inside call to him, mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, the butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten [[silent film]] star Norma Desmond. Learning Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about [[Salome]]. She plans to play the role herself in a return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a [[script doctor]].\n\nMoved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns that the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who explains that Norma is emotionally fragile and has attempted [[suicide]]. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers that he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. Joe tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party he again meets Betty, whom he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.\n\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole, but petulantly refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 [[Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A|Isotta Fraschini]]. The older studio employees recognize her and warmly greet her. DeMille receives her affectionately and treats her with great respect, tactfully evading her questions about her script. Meanwhile, Max learns that Cole merely wants to rent her unusual car for a film.\n\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights at Betty's Paramount office, collaborating on an original screenplay. His moonlighting is found out by Max, who reveals that he was a respected film director, discovered Norma as a teenage girl, made her a star and was her first husband. After she divorced him, he found life without her unbearable and abandoned his career to become her servant. Meanwhile, despite Betty's engagement to Artie, she and Joe fall in love. After Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe's and Betty's names on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, overhearing, invites Betty to come see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends he is satisfied being a [[gigolo]], but after she tearfully leaves he packs for a return to his old [[Ohio]] newspaper job. He bluntly informs Norma there will be no comeback, her fan mail comes from Max, and she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him to back it up. As Joe walks out of the house, Norma shoots him three times and he falls into the pool.\n\nThe flashback ends. The house is filled with police and reporters. Norma, having lost touch with reality, believes the [[newsreel]] cameras are there to film ''Salome''. Max and the police play along. Max sets up a scene for her and calls, \"Action!\" As the cameras roll, Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. She pauses and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, ending with, \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" as she makes a series of exaggerated swooping steps towards the camera, an equally exaggerated 'come-hither' expression upon her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis\n* [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Max von Mayerling\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Betty Schaefer\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Sheldrake, film producer\n* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Morino, Joe's agent\n* [[Jack Webb]] as Artie Green\n* [[Franklyn Farnum]] as Undertaker\n* [[Larry J.

The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the [[star system (film)|star system]], luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\n\nAs a young man living in [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, [[Billy Wilder]] was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.<ref name=\"perry\">Perry, p. ??</ref>\n\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of [[Mary Pickford]] and the mental disorders of [[Mae Murray]] and [[Clara Bow]]. It is usually regarded as a fictional composite inspired by several different people, not just a thinly disguised portrait of one in particular. Nevertheless, some{{who|date=March 2020}} commentators have tried to identify specific models. One{{who|date=March 2020}} asserts that [[Norma Talmadge]] is \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Kehr | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/movies/homevideo/14kehr.html | title=An Independent Woman, Nobly Suffering in Silents | work=[[The New York Times]]| date= March 11, 2010 | accessdate= November 19, 2011}}</ref> The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress [[Mabel Normand]] and director [[William Desmond Taylor]], a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Gloria Swanson & Billy Wilder - ca. 1950.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Billy Wilder]] ]]\nWilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, [[D. M. Marshman Jr.]], formerly a writer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film ''[[The Emperor Waltz]]'' (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from [[Paramount Pictures]] and avoid the restrictive [[censorship]] of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Breen Code]], they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called ''A Can of Beans'' (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n<blockquote>The fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's [[Mack Sennett]]-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.<ref>Kirgo (1979), p.276.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others.

Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting [[Mae West]] and [[Marlon Brando]] for the leads, but never contacted either with an offer. The filmakers approached [[Greta Garbo]], but she was not interested. Wilder contacted [[Pola Negri]] by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to [[Norma Shearer]], but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering [[Fred MacMurray]] to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited [[Mary Pickford]], but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing [[Montgomery Clift]] with her.<ref>Sikov, p. 286</ref>\n\nAccording to Wilder, he asked [[George Cukor]] for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most feted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. At the peak of her career in 1925, she was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week, and from 1920 until the early 1930s, she lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into [[talking pictures]]. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures. She accepted the end of her film career, and in the early 1930s moved to [[New York City]], where she worked in [[radio]]. In the mid-1940s, she worked in [[television]] and on the New York stage. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became  intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\nSwanson was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a [[screen test]], saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate,<ref name=\"swanson\">Swanson, pp.249-260</ref> and she signed a contract for $50,000.<ref>Sikov, p. 285</ref> In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There ''was'' a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"<ref name=\"aboutfilmnoir\">[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue10/features/wilder/ Billy Wilder \u2013 \"About Film Noir].

An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to ''any'' woman.\"<ref>Sikov, p. 288</ref>  Clift himself was having an affair with a much older woman (the singer [[Libby Holman]]) which was suggested as his real reason for withdrawing from the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|accessdate=3 December 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=23 September 2014|quote=He was also close with stage actress Libby Holman, 16 years his senior, who had become a notorious feature in the gossip columns following the suspicious death of her wealthy husband, rumors of lesbianism, and her general practice of dating younger men.

Following an appearance in ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'' (1940), he served in the military in [[World War II]], and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 was much less than had been offered to Clift.<ref>Sikov, pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nErich von Stroheim, a leading film director of the 1920s who had directed Swanson, was signed to play Max, Norma's faithful servant, protector, and former husband. For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose [[Nancy Olson]], who had recently been considered for the role of [[Delilah]] in Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]].''<ref name=\"staggs\">Staggs (2002), p. ??</ref>\n\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, and was filmed on the set of ''Samson and Delilah'' at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\" as he had called Swanson.\n\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, described in the script as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's contemporaries [[Buster Keaton]], [[Anna Q. Nilsson]], and [[H. B. Warner]], who like DeMille, played themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Cinematography and design===\n\nThe film's dark, shadowy [[black-and-white]], [[film noir]] cinematography was the work of [[John F. Seitz]]. Wilder had worked with him on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene. Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a trick he had also used for ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Christopher|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|date=2015|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=9780520284357|pages=86\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nThe film had the option to be shot in color, but it was instead shot in black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre. (The term ''noir'' is French for ''black''.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terry|first1=Ryan|title=Why Sunset Boulevard Still Capture the \"Eyes of the World\" Today.|url=https://the-artifice.com/why-sunset-boulevard-still-captures-the-eyes-of-the-world-today/|website=The Artifice|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes, \"In both ''Double Indemnity'' and ''Sunset Boulevard'', Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion. Again with no seams showing.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n[[Edith Head]] designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the [[Christian Dior|Dior]] look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Truhler|first1=Kimberly|title=Cinema Style--Edith Head Gets Gloria Swanson Ready for her Close-Up in SUNSET BOULEVARD|url=http://www.glamamor.com/2014/09/SunsetBoulevard-GloriaSwanson-EdithHead.html|website=GlamAmor|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\"<ref name=\"swanson\" /> Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" /> Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.\n\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer [[Hans Dreier]], whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. [[William Haines]], an interior designer and former actor, later refuted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"[[Bebe Daniels]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept was actually owned by the dancer [[Gaby Deslys]], who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) starring [[Lon Chaney]].\n\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe Gillis's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often populated by struggling writers. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual back lot, and the interior of [[Schwab's Drug Store]] was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at [[William O. Jenkins House|a house]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] built during the 1920s by the millionaire [[William O. Jenkins]]. Jenkins and his family lived in it for just one year, then left it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname, the \"Phantom House\".<ref>'Wilshire Phantom House Soon to be Only Memory\", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 24, 1957</ref> By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of [[J. Paul Getty|J.&nbsp;Paul Getty]]. The house was later featured in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to allow construction of an office building .<ref>[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html Sunset Boulevard film locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806060957/http://movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html# |date=2013-08-06 }}, The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The top houses from the movies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor [[Wally Westmore]] to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n==Score==\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (film score)}}\n\nThe musical score was the final element added to ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sikov|first1=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|date=2017|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1496812650|page=300}}</ref> The film was scored by [[Franz Waxman]]. His theme for Norma Desmond was based on [[tango music]], inspired by her having danced the tango with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis's [[bebop]] theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for [[compact disc]] by the [[Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Joel McNeely]] and released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=15251 |title=Soundtrack details: Sunset Blvd |publisher=SoundtrackCollector |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Original release and responses==\n\n===Previews and revision===\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in [[Evanston, Illinois]], in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a [[morgue]], with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], and a third in [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening,<ref>Staggs (2002), pp. 151-152</ref> using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.<ref name=\"AFIdetail\">Production dates per the online [http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=26513 AFI Catalog of Feature Films detailed listing]</ref>\n\nIn Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, [[Barbara Stanwyck]] knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for [[Mary Pickford]], only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" [[Louis B. Mayer]] berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sikov|first=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|year=1999|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-8503-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

At the time its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by ''[[All About Eve]]'', which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.

They parted amicably and respected their long-term partnership by not airing any grievance publicly. Their mutual respect and courteous integrity remained in force throughout the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director [[Garson Kanin]] that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully. When asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.<ref>Sikov, pp. 305\u2013306</ref>\n\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] ''Sunset Boulevard.'' Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, ''Past Performance'', served as the basis for the ''Sunset'' script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in [[damages|general damages]], $250,000 in [[punitive damages]], $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.<ref>Sikov, pp. 310\u2013311</ref>\n\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), and wrote ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'' (1953), the breakthrough film for [[Marilyn Monroe]] as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and ''[[Some Like It Hot]].'' Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States.\n\nNancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963), in which she was paired with [[Fred MacMurray]], but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\n\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in ''Sunset Boulevard''. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' was shown again in [[New York City]] in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\n\nFilms that discuss ''Sunset Boulevard'' in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include ''[[Soapdish]]'' (1991), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001),<ref name=\"staggs\" /> ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006) and ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005). The ending of ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) is a parody of ''Sunset Boulevard's'' final scene.\n\n==Restoration and home media==\nBy the late 1990s, most ''Sunset Boulevard'' prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using [[nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[filmstock]], much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it [[digital video|digitally]] restored.

(at first ''Starring Norma Desmond''). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, ''About Time'' (based on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.<ref name=StapleyHughes>Based on liner notes to ''Boulevard!'' demo recording CD release, by Richard Stapley, Tim J Hutton and Steven M Warner</ref>\n\nIn this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live \"happily ever after.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\n\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from ''Boulevard!'' into a musical ''Swanson on Sunset'', based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing ''Boulevard!''.\n\n===Other failed attempts===\n[[Stephen Sondheim]] briefly considered turning ''Sunset Boulevard'' into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Look, I made a hat : collected lyrics (1981-2011) with attendant comments, amplifications, dogmas, harangues, wafflings, anecdotes and miscellany|last=Stephen.|first=Sondheim|date=2011|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-0753522608|location=London|oclc=751797401}}</ref> [[Hal Prince]] later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with [[Angela Lansbury]] playing Norma Desmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html|title=Side by Side With Stephen Sondheim|website=sondheim.com|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard : Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the dark Hollywood dream|last=Staggs|first=Sam|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=February 2003|isbn=0312302541|edition= 1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York|page=320|oclc=51815402}}</ref>\n\n===Lloyd Webber and Black & Hampton===\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (musical)}}\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and [[Christopher Hampton]], and music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] was staged in 1993 in London, with [[Patti LuPone]] playing Norma Desmond.

It was named after the [[Sunset Boulevard|thoroughfare with the same name]] that runs through [[Los Angeles]] and [[Beverly Hills, California]].\n\nThe film stars [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis, a struggling [[screenwriter]], and [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond, a former [[silent-film]] star who draws him into her demented fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. [[Erich von Stroheim]] plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and [[Nancy Olson]], [[Jack Webb]], [[Lloyd Gough]], and [[Fred Clark]] appear in supporting roles. Director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and [[gossip columnist]] [[Hedda Hopper]] play themselves, and the film includes [[cameo appearance]]s by leading silent-film actors [[Buster Keaton]], [[H. B. Warner]], and [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].\n\nPraised by many [[Film critic|critics]] when first released, ''Sunset Boulevard'' was nominated for 11 [[Academy Awards]] (including nominations in [[List of films with all four Academy Award acting nominations|all four acting categories]]) and won three. It is currently ranked among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest movies ever made]]. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] in 1989, ''Sunset Boulevard'' was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. In 1998, it was ranked number 12 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Movies|100 best American films]] of the 20th century, and in 2007, it was 16th on their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary list]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT, should be 400 to 700 words-->\n<!--This 20140426 version of the plot summary comes in at 696 actual visible words, treating hyphens as spaces.

In a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Joe relates the events leading to his death.\n\nSix months earlier, down-on-his-luck [[screenwriting|screenwriter]] Joe tries selling [[Paramount Pictures]] producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. [[Script coverage|Script reader]] Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from [[repossession]] men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman inside call to him, mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, the butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten [[silent film]] star Norma Desmond. Learning Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about [[Salome]]. She plans to play the role herself in a return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a [[script doctor]].\n\nMoved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns that the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who explains that Norma is emotionally fragile and has attempted [[suicide]]. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers that he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. Joe tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party he again meets Betty, whom he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.\n\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole, but petulantly refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 [[Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A|Isotta Fraschini]]. The older studio employees recognize her and warmly greet her. DeMille receives her affectionately and treats her with great respect, tactfully evading her questions about her script. Meanwhile, Max learns that Cole merely wants to rent her unusual car for a film.\n\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights at Betty's Paramount office, collaborating on an original screenplay. His moonlighting is found out by Max, who reveals that he was a respected film director, discovered Norma as a teenage girl, made her a star and was her first husband. After she divorced him, he found life without her unbearable and abandoned his career to become her servant. Meanwhile, despite Betty's engagement to Artie, she and Joe fall in love. After Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe's and Betty's names on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, overhearing, invites Betty to come see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends he is satisfied being a [[gigolo]], but after she tearfully leaves he packs for a return to his old [[Ohio]] newspaper job. He bluntly informs Norma there will be no comeback, her fan mail comes from Max, and she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him to back it up. As Joe walks out of the house, Norma shoots him three times and he falls into the pool.\n\nThe flashback ends. The house is filled with police and reporters. Norma, having lost touch with reality, believes the [[newsreel]] cameras are there to film ''Salome''. Max and the police play along. Max sets up a scene for her and calls, \"Action!\" As the cameras roll, Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. She pauses and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, ending with, \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" as she makes a series of exaggerated swooping steps towards the camera, an equally exaggerated 'come-hither' expression upon her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis\n* [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Max von Mayerling\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Betty Schaefer\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Sheldrake, film producer\n* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Morino, Joe's agent\n* [[Jack Webb]] as Artie Green\n* [[Franklyn Farnum]] as Undertaker\n* [[Larry J.

The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the [[star system (film)|star system]], luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\n\nAs a young man living in [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, [[Billy Wilder]] was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.<ref name=\"perry\">Perry, p. ??</ref>\n\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of [[Mary Pickford]] and the mental disorders of [[Mae Murray]] and [[Clara Bow]]. It is usually regarded as a fictional composite inspired by several different people, not just a thinly disguised portrait of one in particular. Nevertheless, some{{who|date=March 2020}} commentators have tried to identify specific models. One{{who|date=March 2020}} asserts that [[Norma Talmadge]] is \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Kehr | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/movies/homevideo/14kehr.html | title=An Independent Woman, Nobly Suffering in Silents | work=[[The New York Times]]| date= March 11, 2010 | accessdate= November 19, 2011}}</ref> The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress [[Mabel Normand]] and director [[William Desmond Taylor]], a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Gloria Swanson & Billy Wilder - ca. 1950.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Billy Wilder]] ]]\nWilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, [[D. M. Marshman Jr.]], formerly a writer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film ''[[The Emperor Waltz]]'' (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from [[Paramount Pictures]] and avoid the restrictive [[censorship]] of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Breen Code]], they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called ''A Can of Beans'' (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n<blockquote>The fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's [[Mack Sennett]]-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.<ref>Kirgo (1979), p.276.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. When asked if ''Sunset Boulevard'' was a [[black comedy]], he replied: \"No, just a picture\".<ref name=\"londonreviewofbooks\">Wood, Michael (March 2, 2000).

Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting [[Mae West]] and [[Marlon Brando]] for the leads, but never contacted either with an offer. The filmakers approached [[Greta Garbo]], but she was not interested. Wilder contacted [[Pola Negri]] by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to [[Norma Shearer]], but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering [[Fred MacMurray]] to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited [[Mary Pickford]], but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing [[Montgomery Clift]] with her.<ref>Sikov, p. 286</ref>\n\nAccording to Wilder, he asked [[George Cukor]] for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most feted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. At the peak of her career in 1925, she was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week, and from 1920 until the early 1930s, she lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into [[talking pictures]]. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures. She accepted the end of her film career, and in the early 1930s moved to [[New York City]], where she worked in [[radio]]. In the mid-1940s, she worked in [[television]] and on the New York stage. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became  intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\nSwanson was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a [[screen test]], saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate,<ref name=\"swanson\">Swanson, pp.249-260</ref> and she signed a contract for $50,000.<ref>Sikov, p. 285</ref> In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There ''was'' a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"<ref name=\"aboutfilmnoir\">[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue10/features/wilder/ Billy Wilder \u2013 \"About Film Noir].

An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to ''any'' woman.\"<ref>Sikov, p. 288</ref>  Clift himself was having an affair with a much older woman (the singer [[Libby Holman]]) which was suggested as his real reason for withdrawing from the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|accessdate=3 December 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=23 September 2014|quote=He was also close with stage actress Libby Holman, 16 years his senior, who had become a notorious feature in the gossip columns following the suspicious death of her wealthy husband, rumors of lesbianism, and her general practice of dating younger men.

Following an appearance in ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'' (1940), he served in the military in [[World War II]], and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 was much less than had been offered to Clift.<ref>Sikov, pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nErich von Stroheim, a leading film director of the 1920s who had directed Swanson, was signed to play Max, Norma's faithful servant, protector, and former husband. For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose [[Nancy Olson]], who had recently been considered for the role of [[Delilah]] in Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]].''<ref name=\"staggs\">Staggs (2002), p. ??</ref>\n\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, and was filmed on the set of ''Samson and Delilah'' at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\" as he had called Swanson.\n\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, described in the script as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's contemporaries [[Buster Keaton]], [[Anna Q. Nilsson]], and [[H. B. Warner]], who like DeMille, played themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Cinematography and design===\n\nThe film's dark, shadowy [[black-and-white]], [[film noir]] cinematography was the work of [[John F. Seitz]]. Wilder had worked with him on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene. Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a trick he had also used for ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Christopher|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|date=2015|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=9780520284357|pages=86\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nThe film had the option to be shot on color, however it was shot on black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre. (The term ''noir'' is French for ''black''.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terry|first1=Ryan|title=Why Sunset Boulevard Still Capture the \"Eyes of the World\" Today.|url=https://the-artifice.com/why-sunset-boulevard-still-captures-the-eyes-of-the-world-today/|website=The Artifice|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes, \"In both ''Double Indemnity'' and ''Sunset Boulevard'', Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion. Again with no seams showing.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n[[Edith Head]] designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the [[Christian Dior|Dior]] look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Truhler|first1=Kimberly|title=Cinema Style--Edith Head Gets Gloria Swanson Ready for her Close-Up in SUNSET BOULEVARD|url=http://www.glamamor.com/2014/09/SunsetBoulevard-GloriaSwanson-EdithHead.html|website=GlamAmor|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\"<ref name=\"swanson\" /> Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" /> Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.\n\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer [[Hans Dreier]], whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. [[William Haines]], an interior designer and former actor, later refuted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"[[Bebe Daniels]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept was actually owned by the dancer [[Gaby Deslys]], who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) starring [[Lon Chaney]].\n\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe Gillis's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often populated by struggling writers. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual back lot, and the interior of [[Schwab's Drug Store]] was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at [[William O. Jenkins House|a house]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] built during the 1920s by the millionaire [[William O. Jenkins]]. Jenkins and his family lived in it for just one year, then left it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname, the \"Phantom House\".<ref>'Wilshire Phantom House Soon to be Only Memory\", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 24, 1957</ref> By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of [[J. Paul Getty|J.&nbsp;Paul Getty]]. The house was later featured in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to allow construction of an office building .<ref>[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html Sunset Boulevard film locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806060957/http://movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html# |date=2013-08-06 }}, The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The top houses from the movies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor [[Wally Westmore]] to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n==Score==\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (film score)}}\n\nThe musical score was the final element added to ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sikov|first1=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|date=2017|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1496812650|page=300}}</ref> The film was scored by [[Franz Waxman]]. His theme for Norma Desmond was based on [[tango music]], inspired by her having danced the tango with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis's [[bebop]] theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for [[compact disc]] by the [[Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Joel McNeely]] and released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=15251 |title=Soundtrack details: Sunset Blvd |publisher=SoundtrackCollector |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Original release and responses==\n\n===Previews and revision===\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in [[Evanston, Illinois]], in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a [[morgue]], with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy.

After viewing the film, [[Barbara Stanwyck]] knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for [[Mary Pickford]], only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" [[Louis B. Mayer]] berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sikov|first=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|year=1999|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-8503-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

They parted amicably and respected their long-term partnership by not airing any grievance publicly. Their mutual respect and courteous integrity remained in force throughout the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director [[Garson Kanin]] that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully. When asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.<ref>Sikov, pp. 305\u2013306</ref>\n\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] ''Sunset Boulevard.'' Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, ''Past Performance'', served as the basis for the ''Sunset'' script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in [[damages|general damages]], $250,000 in [[punitive damages]], $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.<ref>Sikov, pp. 310\u2013311</ref>\n\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), and wrote ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'' (1953), the breakthrough film for [[Marilyn Monroe]] as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and ''[[Some Like It Hot]].'' Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States.\n\nNancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963), in which she was paired with [[Fred MacMurray]], but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\n\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in ''Sunset Boulevard''. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' was shown again in [[New York City]] in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\n\nFilms that discuss ''Sunset Boulevard'' in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include ''[[Soapdish]]'' (1991), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001),<ref name=\"staggs\" /> ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006) and ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005). The ending of ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) is a parody of ''Sunset Boulevard's'' final scene.\n\n==Restoration and home media==\nBy the late 1990s, most ''Sunset Boulevard'' prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using [[nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[filmstock]], much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it [[digital video|digitally]] restored.

Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film.

In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\n\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from ''Boulevard!'' into a musical ''Swanson on Sunset'', based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing ''Boulevard!''.\n\n===Other failed attempts===\n[[Stephen Sondheim]] briefly considered turning ''Sunset Boulevard'' into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Look, I made a hat : collected lyrics (1981-2011) with attendant comments, amplifications, dogmas, harangues, wafflings, anecdotes and miscellany|last=Stephen.|first=Sondheim|date=2011|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-0753522608|location=London|oclc=751797401}}</ref> [[Hal Prince]] later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with [[Angela Lansbury]] playing Norma Desmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html|title=Side by Side With Stephen Sondheim|website=sondheim.com|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard : Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the dark Hollywood dream|last=Staggs|first=Sam|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=February 2003|isbn=0312302541|edition= 1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York|page=320|oclc=51815402}}</ref>\n\n===Lloyd Webber and Black & Hampton===\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (musical)}}\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and [[Christopher Hampton]], and music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] was staged in 1993 in London, with [[Patti LuPone]] playing Norma Desmond.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. In addition, the library provides access to 580 databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucmerced.edu/about/library-facts |title=Library Facts |publisher=UC Merced Library |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>\n\nKolligian is a [[Green library]] and has Gold [[LEED certification]].<ref name=\"SignKolligian\">{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo & Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|UC Merced Golden Bobcats}}\n\nUC Merced's recently established an intercollegiate athletic program presently competes in the [[California Pacific Conference]] of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. In addition, the library provides access to 580 databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucmerced.edu/about/library-facts |title=Library Facts |publisher=UC Merced Library |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>\n\nKolligian is a [[Green library]] and has Gold [[LEED certification]].<ref name=\"SignKolligian\">{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo & Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|UC Merced Golden Bobcats}}\n\nUC Merced's recently established an intercollegiate athletic program presently competes in the [[California Pacific Conference]] of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].
