The newspapers did not bother recording the point scorers though they did mention that the Shore side gave everybody in the team a chance to kick for goal.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 5\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Ponsonby Defeats City/Wins for North Shore and Grafton\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = City\n| try1 = [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]] (mark)\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = [[Ernie Asher]]\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Otahuhu\n| score = 8\u201317\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grafton V Otahuhu\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = George Cook, [[Arthur Hardgrave]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = M Stanaway\n| try2 = [[Bob Mitchell (rugby league)|Bob Mitchell]], [[Karl Ifwersen]] 2\n| con2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]] 3\n| pen2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]]\n| stadium = Otahuhu\n| attendance =\n| referee = Tyson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = North Shore\n| score = 43\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = North Shore V Newton\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Newton\n| try1 = unknown x ?\n| con1 = unknown x ?\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = unknown x 1\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = Benson\n}}\n\n===Final===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 18 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 2\u201313\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Championship Final/Won by North Shore/A Record Attendance\n| page = 4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15665\n| date = 1914-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140720.2.10.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]]\n| try2 =Wynyard, Edward Fox, [[Stan Weston]]\n| con2 = Jack Paul 2\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = R Benson\n}}\n\n===Top Try Scorers and Point Scorers===\nNone of the North Shore point scorers from their farcical Round 9 match with Newton Rangers were credited and therefore the following lists will be inaccurate as 43 points were scored by them.

His radio experience led to him hosting his own live streaming radio show called \u201cOn the Mark\u201d on pgatour.com. The show aired for three days per week in 2015 and after one season the PGA TOUR driven radio initiative morphed into a podcast called \u201cOn the Mark.\u201d<ref>https://www.pgatour.com/news/2016/08/22/PGA-TOUR-podcasts.html</ref> The first podcast was released in February 2016, and to date it has been downloaded over 2.5 Million times in over 125 countries.\n \nMark\u2019s broadcast work for the PGA TOUR also included him being a part of the \u201cLive @\u201d crew for pgatour.com for a short stint.

His work in 4K expanded when he was offered analyst roles on The Masters broadcasts of \u201cMasters On the Range,\u201d \u201cFeatured Groups\u201d and \u201cAmen Corner.\u201d<ref>https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/cbs-sports/releases/view?id=49842</ref> His career in the 4K broadcasts also had him being used as an on-course announcer, and he continued to grow and impress in his role at CBS Sports and he was eventually promoted and became a member of the CBS Sports Network show announce crew in 2018.<ref>https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/cbs-sports/shows/golf-on-cbs/bios?id=mark-immelman</ref>\n \nMark is also an analyst on the CBS Sports digital podcast \u201cThe First Cut\u201d and a golf analyst for CBS Sports HQ.<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/the-first-cut-golf-podcast/</ref>\n \nIn his combined radio and television career, Mark has broadcasted two of the four [[Men's major golf championships|Majors]] in professional golf ([[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] and [[PGA Championship|the PGA Championship]]).

It celebrated its centenary in 2009. Four representative matches had been played in 1908 as players in Auckland attempted to showcase the new code to both Auckland residents and those elsewhere.\n\n==First Meeting==\nA meeting of players was held on Monday 12 July where it was decided to call for another meeting the following Monday and to invite all interested parties to attend. The ultimate aim was to form a league. It was also stated that \"three clubs will be formed, two in the city and one at the North Shore\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/A Forward Movement\n| page = 4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14112\n| date = 14 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090714.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> The meeting was duly held on 19 July at the Chamber of Commerce on Swanson Street. Mr. A.E. Glover, M.P., occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance of around 150 supporters and players. They were to affiliate with the Northern Union and hold a practice match on the following Saturday. \"Mr. R. Eagleton offered the league the use of three suitable playing grounds in Epsom\". The ground was located near Potters Paddock which was later converted into Alexandra Racecourse.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Past Glories of the Domain/Old-Time Sports Grounds\n| page = 56\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14112\n| date = 14 July 1930\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19300507.2.199.83\n| accessdate = 12 October 2019}}</ref> Elections for officers were also held with 14 appointments made.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Auckland Rugby Football League\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LXI, Issue 106\n| date = 7 May 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090720.2.99.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==North Shore Albions Are Formed==\nA further meeting was held at North Shore on the Wednesday evening at the Council Chambers in Devonport with 40 in attendance, and a club was formed. It was noted that they had the playing numbers for two teams and they had \"taken the pick of the amateur players of the district club\". The club would be called [[North Shore Albions]]. On the Thursday night a preliminary meeting was held in the city with 20 players attending with the goal of forming a club that was either a city team or a combination of a city and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team, while a [[Newton Rangers|Newton club]] was also aimed to be formed the following week as there was \"considerable dissatisfaction among the members at the management of the Auckland Union\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Rapid Developments/Clubs Being Formed\n| page = 8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14120\n| date = 23 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090723.2.106.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> It was decided to play a match on the Saturday between the [[North Shore Albions|North Shore]] team and the city team. The match was duly played between North Shore and [[City Rovers|City]] and resulted in a win to the former by 44 points to 22.\n\nChairman of the league, D.W. McLean spoke with a representative of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system. There was no sport in being beaten by 61 points to nil as the North Shore seniors were recently by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team\u2026 the management of the Auckland Union was not mindful enough of the clubs\u2019 or players interests\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union Game/Bright Play and Sparkling Situations\n| page = 4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14124\n| date = 28 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090728.2.11.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ponsonby United Are Born==\nAt a meeting at Leys Institute on 30 July the Ponsonby club was formed.

It celebrated its centenary in 2009. Four representative matches had been played in 1908 as players in Auckland attempted to showcase the new code to both Auckland residents and those elsewhere.\n\n==First Meeting==\nA meeting of players was held on Monday 12 July where it was decided to call for another meeting the following Monday and to invite all interested parties to attend. The ultimate aim was to form a league. It was also stated that \"three clubs will be formed, two in the city and one at the North Shore\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/A Forward Movement\n| page = 4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14112\n| date = 14 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090714.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> The meeting was duly held on 19 July at the Chamber of Commerce on Swanson Street. Mr. A.E. Glover, M.P., occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance of around 150 supporters and players. They were to affiliate with the Northern Union and hold a practice match on the following Saturday. \"Mr. R. Eagleton offered the league the use of three suitable playing grounds in Epsom\". The ground was located near Potters Paddock which was later converted into Alexandra Racecourse.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Past Glories of the Domain/Old-Time Sports Grounds\n| page = 56\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14112\n| date = 14 July 1930\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19300507.2.199.83\n| accessdate = 12 October 2019}}</ref> Elections for officers were also held with 14 appointments made.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Auckland Rugby Football League\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LXI, Issue 106\n| date = 7 May 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090720.2.99.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==North Shore Albions Are Formed==\nA further meeting was held at North Shore on the Wednesday evening at the Council Chambers in Devonport with 40 in attendance, and a club was formed. It was noted that they had the playing numbers for two teams and they had \"taken the pick of the amateur players of the district club\". The club would be called [[North Shore Albions]]. On the Thursday night a preliminary meeting was held in the city with 20 players attending with the goal of forming a club that was either a city team or a combination of a city and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team, while a [[Newton Rangers|Newton club]] was also aimed to be formed the following week as there was \"considerable dissatisfaction among the members at the management of the Auckland Union\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Rapid Developments/Clubs Being Formed\n| page = 8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14120\n| date = 23 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090723.2.106.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> It was decided to play a match on the Saturday between the [[North Shore Albions|North Shore]] team and the city team. The match was duly played between North Shore and [[City Rovers|City]] and resulted in a win to the former by 44 points to 22.\n\nChairman of the league, D.W. McLean spoke with a representative of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system. There was no sport in being beaten by 61 points to nil as the North Shore seniors were recently by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team\u2026 the management of the Auckland Union was not mindful enough of the clubs\u2019 or players interests\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union Game/Bright Play and Sparkling Situations\n| page = 4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14124\n| date = 28 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090728.2.11.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ponsonby United Are Born==\nAt a meeting at Leys Institute on 30 July the Ponsonby club was formed.
