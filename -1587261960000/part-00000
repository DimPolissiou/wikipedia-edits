[[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] stresses that the [[Hellenistic Greeks]] were viewed by contemporary [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of [[Classical Greece]], an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern [[historiography]]. Regarding Hellenistic Egypt, Grant argues, \"Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the 'Hellenistic Age' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could ''any'' Greek age, now that [[Roman Republic|the Romans]] were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.\"</ref> Her native language was [[Koine Greek]], and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the [[Egyptian language]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"languages\"/>\n\nIn 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father, King [[Ptolemy XII]], during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a [[Roman client state]]) allowed his daughter [[Berenice IV]] to claim the throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when the King returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint [[reign of Cleopatra]] and her brother [[Ptolemy XIII]] began. A falling-out between them led to open [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator#Civil war|civil war]]. After losing the 48 BC [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in [[Roman Greece|Greece]] against his rival [[Julius Caesar]] (a [[Roman dictator]] and [[Roman consul|consul]]) in [[Caesar's Civil War]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Pompey]] fled to Egypt, where Ptolemy had him killed while Caesar occupied [[Alexandria]]. Caesar had attempted to reconcile the siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser [[Potheinos]] viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so [[Ptolemaic army|his forces]] [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|besieged her and Caesar at the palace]]. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy died in the [[47 BC Battle of the Nile]]. His sister [[Arsinoe IV]] was eventually exiled to [[Ephesus]] for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother [[Ptolemy XIV]] joint rulers, but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's [[Roman villa|villa]]. After the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinations of Caesar]] and (on her orders) Ptolemy XIV in 44 BC, she named Caesarion co-ruler.\n\nIn the [[Liberators' civil war]] of 43\u201342 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman [[Second Triumvirate]] formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir [[Octavian]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. After their meeting at [[Tarsos]] in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during [[Antony's Parthian War|his invasions]] of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. The [[Donations of Alexandria]] declared their children [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (son of Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister [[Octavia Minor]] led to the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Final War]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the [[Roman Senate]] to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC [[Battle of Actium]], [[Roman army of the late Republic|Octavian's forces]] invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his [[Roman triumph]]al procession, she killed herself by poisoning (contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an [[Asp (reptile)|asp]]).\n\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern [[List of cultural depictions of Cleopatra|works of art]]. [[Roman historiography]] and [[Latin poetry]] produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature]]. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include [[Roman portraiture|Roman busts]], [[Roman art|paintings]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]]s, [[cameo carving]]s and [[cameo glass|glass]], [[Ptolemaic coinage|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], and [[relief]]s. In [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] she was the subject of many works including [[opera]]s, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a [[pop culture icon]] of [[Egyptomania]] since the [[Victorian era]], and in modern times Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, [[burlesque]] satire, Hollywood films, and [[brand image]]s for commercial products.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|Kleop\u00e1tr\u0101}}

[[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] stresses that the [[Hellenistic Greeks]] were viewed by contemporary [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of [[Classical Greece]], an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern [[historiography]]. Regarding Hellenistic Egypt, Grant argues, \"Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the 'Hellenistic Age' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could ''any'' Greek age, now that [[Roman Republic|the Romans]] were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.\"</ref> Her native language was [[Koine Greek]], and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the [[Egyptian language]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"languages\"/>\n\nIn 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father [[Ptolemy XII]] during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt, a [[Roman client state]], allowed his daughter [[Berenice IV]] to claim the throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when the king returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint [[reign of Cleopatra]] and her brother [[Ptolemy XIII]] began. A falling-out between them led to open [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator#Civil war|civil war]]. After losing the 48 BC [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in [[Roman Greece|Greece]] against his rival [[Julius Caesar]] (a [[Roman dictator]] and [[Roman consul|consul]]) in [[Caesar's Civil War]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Pompey]] fled to Egypt, where Ptolemy had him killed while Caesar occupied [[Alexandria]]. Caesar had attempted to reconcile the siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser [[Potheinos]] viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so [[Ptolemaic army|his forces]] [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|besieged her and Caesar at the palace]]. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy died in the [[47 BC Battle of the Nile]]. His sister [[Arsinoe IV]] was eventually exiled to [[Ephesus]] for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother [[Ptolemy XIV]] joint rulers, but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's [[Roman villa|villa]]. After the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinations of Caesar]] and (on her orders) Ptolemy XIV in 44 BC, she named Caesarion co-ruler.\n\nIn the [[Liberators' civil war]] of 43\u201342 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman [[Second Triumvirate]] formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir [[Octavian]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. After their meeting at [[Tarsos]] in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during [[Antony's Parthian War|his invasions]] of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. The [[Donations of Alexandria]] declared their children [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (son of Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister [[Octavia Minor]] led to the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Final War]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the [[Roman Senate]] to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC [[Battle of Actium]], [[Roman army of the late Republic|Octavian's forces]] invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his [[Roman triumph]]al procession, she killed herself by poisoning (contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an [[Asp (reptile)|asp]]).\n\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern [[List of cultural depictions of Cleopatra|works of art]]. [[Roman historiography]] and [[Latin poetry]] produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature]]. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include [[Roman portraiture|Roman busts]], [[Roman art|paintings]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]]s, [[cameo carving]]s and [[cameo glass|glass]], [[Ptolemaic coinage|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], and [[relief]]s. In [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] she was the subject of many works including [[opera]]s, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a [[pop culture icon]] of [[Egyptomania]] since the [[Victorian era]], and in modern times Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, [[burlesque]] satire, Hollywood films, and [[brand image]]s for commercial products.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|Kleop\u00e1tr\u0101}}

However, as explained by {{harvtxt|Fletcher|2008|pp=82, 88\u201393}}, the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|native Egyptian priesthood]] was strongly linked to their Ptolemaic royal patrons, to the point where Cleopatra is speculated to have had an Egyptian half-cousin, [[Pasherienptah III]], the [[High Priest of Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt]].</ref> [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and \"would have described herself as Greek.\"{{sfnp|Grant|1972|p=5}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=5}} argues that Cleopatra's grandmother, i.e. the mother of Ptolemy XII, might have been a [[Syrians|Syrian]] (though conceding that \"it is possible she was also partly Greek\"), but almost certainly not an Egyptian because there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemaic ruler throughout their entire dynasty.</ref> [[Stacy Schiff]] writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress.{{sfnp|Schiff|2011|pp=2, 42}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Schiff|2011|p=42}} further argues that, considering Cleopatra's ancestry, she was not dark-skinned, though notes Cleopatra was likely not among the Ptolemies with fair features, and instead would have been honey-skinned, citing as evidence that her relatives were described as such and it \"would have presumably applied to her as well.\" {{harvtxt|Goldsworthy|2010|pp=127, 128}} agrees to this, contending that Cleopatra, having Macedonian blood with a little Syrian, was probably not dark-skinned (as Roman propaganda never mentions it), writing \"fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry,\" though also notes she could have had a \"darker more Mediterranean complexion\" because of her mixed ancestry. {{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=5}} agrees to Goldsworthy's latter speculation of her skin color, that though almost certainly not Egyptian, Cleopatra had a darker complexion due to being Greek mixed with Persian and possible Syrian ancestry. {{harvtxt|Preston|2009|p=77}} agrees with Grant that, considering this ancestry, Cleopatra was \"almost certainly dark-haired and olive-skinned.\" {{harvtxt|Bradford|2000|p=14}} contends that it is \"reasonable to infer\" Cleopatra had dark hair and \"pale olive skin.\"</ref> [[Duane W. Roller]] speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to [[Ptah]] (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship),<ref group=\"note\">For further information on the identity of Cleopatra's mother, see {{harvtxt|Burstein|2004|p=11}}, {{harvtxt|Fletcher|2008|p=73}}, {{harvtxt|Goldsworthy|2010|pp=127, 128}}, {{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=4}}, and {{harvtxt|Roller|2010|pp=165\u2013166}}. [[Joann Fletcher]] finds this hypothesis to be dubious and lacking evidence. [[Stanley M. Burstein]] claims that strong circumstantial evidence suggests Cleopatra's mother could have been a member of the [[High Priest of Ptah|priestly family of Ptah]], but that historians generally assume her mother was Cleopatra V Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII. [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] dismisses the idea of Cleopatra's mother being a member of an Egyptian priestly family as \"pure conjecture,\" adding that either Cleopatra V or a concubine \"probably of Greek origin\" would be Cleopatra VII's mother. [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] contends that Cleopatra V was most likely Cleopatra VII's mother. [[Duane W. Roller]] notes that while Cleopatra could have been the daughter of the priestly family of Ptah, the other main candidate would be Cleopatra VI, maintaining the uncertainty stems from Cleopatra V/VI's \"loss of favor\" that \"obscured the issue.\"</ref> but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=15, 18, 166}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Schiff|2011|pp=2}} concurs with this, concluding that Cleopatra \"upheld the family tradition.\" As noted by {{harvtxt|Dudley|1960|pp=57}}, Cleopatra and her family were \"the successor[s] to the native Pharaohs, exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy the great natural resources of the Nile Valley.\"</ref> [[Ernle Bradford]] writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman \"but as a civilized Greek.\"{{sfnp|Bradford|2000|p=17}}\n\nClaims that Cleopatra was an [[illegitimate]] child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her.{{sfnp|Grant|1972|p=4}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=165}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=4}} argues that if Cleopatra had been illegitimate, her \"numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.\"</ref> Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate.{{sfnp|Grant|1972|p=4}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=165}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=11, 69}} Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=18\u201319}} The high degree of [[inbreeding]] among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"family tree\">The family tree and short discussions of the individuals can be found in {{harvtxt|Dodson|Hilton|2004|pp=268\u2013281}}.
