Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=\"Cities\">[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=\"Lightning\">Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

Wilder]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Lightning Brigade''', also known as '''Wilder's Brigade''' or the '''Hatchet Brigade''' was a novel, for the US Army formation in the [[American Civil War]], [[mounted infantry]] [[brigade]] in the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Cumberland]] from March 8, 1863 through the November of 1863. Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D. Atkins\n* [[98th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|98th Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col John J.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=\"Cities\">[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

His father was a native of [[South Dakota]], and worked as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator for the ''Berkeley Gazette'' in California. Lucile Fogerty was from [[Great Falls, Montana]]. When John was two years old, his parents converted to [[Catholicism]]. He first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley California. In his memoir, ''Fortunate Son'', Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.<ref name=\"fortunate\">{{cite book|last1=Fogerty|first1=John|title=Fortunate Son- My Life, My Music|date=October 2015|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-24457-2|pages=9\u201325|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fortunate-Son-My-Life-Music/dp/0316244570/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500586304&sr=8-1&keywords=fortunate+son+john+fogerty|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School.

Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with [[Fantasy Records]], which without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to the [[Golliwogs]].

In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|eponymous debut album]] and also had their first hit single, \"[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]\". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and the album ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]''.\n\nFogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Blue Moon Rising: The John Fogerty Interview (Cover Story)|journal=Audio Magazine}}</ref> These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit \"[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]\", and \"[[Someday Never Comes]]\", which barely made it into the ''Billboard'' Top 20.\n\nCook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept ''Mardi Gras'' as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, \"My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs.\" Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or \nFogerty would quit immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |accessdate= April 15, 2020}}</ref> They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status. It did, however, generate weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly afterward the album was released.\n\nThe only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.\n\n== Solo career ==\n===1972\u20131985===\nAs CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of [[country and western]] [[Cover version|covers]], on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers\u2014a band of which he was the only member.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref>\n\nThe eponymous ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'' was released in 1973; it spun off the [[top 20|top-20]] hit \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\", as well as a lesser hit in \"Heart Of Stone\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty, still using \"The Blue Ridge Rangers\" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single\": \"You Don't Owe Me\" b/w \"Back in the Hills\" (Fantasy F-710).  It was a commercial flop, failing to make the Hot 100 in the U.S., though \"You Don't Owe Me\" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching number 79.  Fogerty thereafter abandoned the \"Blue Ridge Rangers\" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In early 1974, Fogerty released \"Comin' Down The Road\"&mdash;backed with the instrumental \"Ricochet\".\n\nHis first official solo album, ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', was released in 1975.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded \"[[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|Rockin' All Over the World]]\", a number-27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, British boogie rockers [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] recorded their version of \"Rockin' All Over the World\", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert.\n\nIn 1976, Fogerty finished an album called ''[[Hoodoo (John Fogerty album)|Hoodoo]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> A single, \"You Got The Magic\" backed with \"Evil Thing\", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by [[Asylum Records]] a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for ''Hoodoo'' sometime in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/hoodoo_john_fogertys_lost_occult_tinged_disco_rock_album |title= \"Hoodoo\", John Fogerty's Lost, Occult-Tinged Disco Album |website= Dangerous Minds |accessdate= April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===1985\u20131997===\n{{See also|The Old Man Down the Road|Fogerty v. Fantasy}}\nAfter a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', his first album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], which had taken co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> ''Centerfield'' went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in \"[[The Old Man Down the Road]].\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.\n\nTwo songs on the album, \"Zanz Kant Danz\" and \"Mr. Greed,\" were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at [[Fantasy Records]], [[Saul Zaentz]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"Zanz Kant Danz\" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would \"steal your money\". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: \"Vanz Kant Danz\" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (''Fantasy, Inc.'' v.'' Fogerty'') claimed that \"The Old Man Down The Road\" shared the same chorus as \"[[Run Through the Jungle]]\", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions.  Fogerty then [[counterclaim|countersued]] for attorney fees (''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]'').  After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nOn May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called ''John Fogerty's All-Stars''. The set list consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the ''Centerfield'' LP and the song \"No Love in You\" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the [[Textones]]' debut album ''Midnight Mission'' and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. ''John Fogerty's All-Stars'' was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included [[Albert Lee]], [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Duck Dunn]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Prairie Prince]].\n\nThe follow-up album to ''Centerfield'' was ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]'' in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. ''Eye of the Zombie'' took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the ''Eye of the Zombie'' tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, \"Change in the Weather\" was included in the set list for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.\n\nFogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, DC, for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on [[HBO]]. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at [[Oakland Coliseum]] for the ''Concert Against AIDS''. His backing band that night consisted of [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] on guitars, [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maniacpaul.thejakubowskis.com/details.php?b_id=112|title=John Fogerty \u2013 In Concert Against AIDS|year=2004|work=thejakubowskis.com|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, specifically from a [[tuberculosis]] infection, having contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were not speaking to each other.<ref>VH1 Legends: John Fogerty--''Viacom International, VH1, 1996''</ref> In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: \"We wanted to grow up and be musicians.

In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]] in performing three songs: \"[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]\", \"[[Born on the Bayou]]\", and \"[[Green River (song)|Green River]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|title=The saddest story in rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3|accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=theguardian.com|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref> During the induction speech, Springsteen said, \"As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty].

The layoff between ''Zombie'' and ''Swamp'' had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than ''Zombie'' and won the [[Grammy]] for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named ''[[Premonition (John Fogerty album)|Premonition]]'', of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998.

His father was a native of [[South Dakota]], and worked as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator for the ''Berkeley Gazette'' in California. Lucile Fogerty was from [[Great Falls, Montana]]. When John was two years old, his parents converted to [[Catholicism]]. He first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley California. In his memoir, ''Fortunate Son'', Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.<ref name=\"fortunate\">{{cite book|last1=Fogerty|first1=John|title=Fortunate Son- My Life, My Music|date=October 2015|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-24457-2|pages=9\u201325|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fortunate-Son-My-Life-Music/dp/0316244570/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500586304&sr=8-1&keywords=fortunate+son+john+fogerty|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School.

Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with [[Fantasy Records]], which without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to the [[Golliwogs]].

In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|eponymous debut album]] and also had their first hit single, \"[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]\". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and the album ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]''.\n\nFogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Blue Moon Rising: The John Fogerty Interview (Cover Story)|journal=Audio Magazine}}</ref> These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit \"[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]\", and \"[[Someday Never Comes]]\", which barely made it into the ''Billboard'' Top 20.\n\nCook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept ''Mardi Gras'' as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, \"My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs.\" Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or \nFogerty would quit immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |accessdate= April 15, 2020}}</ref> They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status. It did, however, generate weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly afterward the album was released.\n\nThe only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.\n\n== Solo career ==\n===1972\u20131985===\nAs CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of [[country and western]] [[Cover version|covers]], on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers\u2014a band of which he was the only member.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref>\n\nThe eponymous ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'' was released in 1973; it spun off the [[top 20|top-20]] hit \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\", as well as a lesser hit in \"Heart Of Stone\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty, still using \"The Blue Ridge Rangers\" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single\": \"You Don't Owe Me\" b/w \"Back in the Hills\" (Fantasy F-710).  It was a commercial flop, failing to make the Hot 100 in the U.S., though \"You Don't Owe Me\" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching number 79.  Fogerty thereafter abandoned the \"Blue Ridge Rangers\" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In early 1974, Fogerty released \"Comin' Down The Road\"&mdash;backed with the instrumental \"Ricochet\".\n\nHis first official solo album, ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', was released in 1975.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded \"[[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|Rockin' All Over the World]]\", a number-27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, British boogie rockers [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] recorded their version of \"Rockin' All Over the World\", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert.\n\nIn 1976, Fogerty finished an album called ''[[Hoodoo (John Fogerty album)|Hoodoo]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> A single, \"You Got The Magic\" backed with \"Evil Thing\", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by [[Asylum Records]] a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for ''Hoodoo'' sometime in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/hoodoo_john_fogertys_lost_occult_tinged_disco_rock_album |title= \"Hoodoo\", John Fogerty's Lost, Occult-Tinged Disco Album |website= Dangerous Minds |accessdate= April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===1985\u20131997===\n{{See also|The Old Man Down the Road|Fogerty v. Fantasy}}\nAfter a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', his first album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], which had taken co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> ''Centerfield'' went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in \"[[The Old Man Down the Road]].\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.\n\nTwo songs on the album, \"Zanz Kant Danz\" and \"Mr. Greed,\" were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at [[Fantasy Records]], [[Saul Zaentz]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"Zanz Kant Danz\" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would \"steal your money\". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: \"Vanz Kant Danz\" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (''Fantasy, Inc.'' v.'' Fogerty'') claimed that \"The Old Man Down The Road\" shared the same chorus as \"[[Run Through the Jungle]]\", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions.  Fogerty then [[counterclaim|countersued]] for attorney fees (''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]'').  After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nOn May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called ''John Fogerty's All-Stars''. The set list consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the ''Centerfield'' LP and the song \"No Love in You\" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the [[Textones]]' debut album ''Midnight Mission'' and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. ''John Fogerty's All-Stars'' was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included [[Albert Lee]], [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Duck Dunn]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Prairie Prince]].\n\nThe follow-up album to ''Centerfield'' was ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]'' in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. ''Eye of the Zombie'' took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the ''Eye of the Zombie'' tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, \"Change in the Weather\" was included in the set list for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.\n\nFogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, DC, for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on [[HBO]]. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at [[Oakland Coliseum]] for the ''Concert Against AIDS''. His backing band that night consisted of [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] on guitars, [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maniacpaul.thejakubowskis.com/details.php?b_id=112|title=John Fogerty \u2013 In Concert Against AIDS|year=2004|work=thejakubowskis.com|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, specifically from a [[tuberculosis]] infection, having contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were not speaking to each other.<ref>VH1 Legends: John Fogerty--''Viacom International, VH1, 1996''</ref> In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: \"We wanted to grow up and be musicians.

Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]] in performing three songs: \"[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]\", \"[[Born on the Bayou]]\", and \"[[Green River (song)|Green River]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|title=The saddest story in rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3|accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=theguardian.com|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref> During the induction speech, Springsteen said, \"As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty].

The layoff between ''Zombie'' and ''Swamp'' had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than ''Zombie'' and won the [[Grammy]] for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named ''[[Premonition (John Fogerty album)|Premonition]]'', of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. A track from ''Blue Moon Swamp'' titled \"Blue Moon Nights,\" was used in the 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.\n\nOn October 1, 1998, Fogerty was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Calendar/CalendarPast2.shtml#walk |title=Recent Hollywood Events |website=Seeing-stars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Fogerty released ''[[Deja Vu All Over Again (album)|Deja Vu All Over Again]]'' through [[DreamWorks Records]], which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's Warner catalog. ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: \"The title track is Fogerty's indictment of the [[Iraq War]] as another [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], a senseless squandering of American lives and power\". On the album, Fogerty squeezed 10 songs into only 34 minutes.\n\nThe sale of Fantasy Records to [[Concord Records]] in 2004 ended the 30-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label, as the new owners took steps to restore [[royalties|royalty]] rights Fogerty had given up to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records, made possible when DreamWorks Records' noncountry-music unit was absorbed by [[Geffen Records]], which dropped Fogerty, but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was ''[[The Long Road Home]]'' (November 2005), a compilation CD combining his CCR hits with solo material. A live CD and concert [[The Long Road Home - In Concert|DVD]] were released the following year.\n\nFogerty's touring schedule increased in the period after ''Deja Vu All Over Again''. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the [[Vote for Change]] tour, playing seven of the concerts in U.S. [[swing states]]. He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian children's group [[The Wiggles]]. <!-- \"Centerfield\" was also played at the 2008 Republican National Convention when John McCain introduced Sarah Palin as his running mate.

The structure was a [[Greek temple|temple-like]] building discovered at [[Tito, Basilicata|Torre Satriano]], near the southern city of [[Potenza]], in [[Basilicata]], a region where local people mingled with [[Greeks]] who settled along the southern coast known as [[Magna Graecia]] and in [[Sicily]] from the 8th century BC onwards. Professor Christopher Smith, director of the [[British School at Rome]], said that the discovery was \"the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way\". Much like the instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the [[Sparta]]n colony of [[Taranto]] in [[Apulia]].<ref>Newsletter of the Hellenic Society of Archaeometry, N.110, May 2010, p.84</ref><ref>[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-came-with-diy-instructions.html Ancient Building Came With DIY Instructions], Discovery News, Mon Apr 26, 2010</ref><ref>[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-greek-temple-do-it-yourself-photos.html Ancient Building Comes with Assembly Instructions, (photos)], Discovery News</ref>\n\nIn North America, there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century. Magazines such as ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' (founded in 1902) and ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'' (founded in 1928) offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills, techniques, tools, and materials. As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions, initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town.\n\n== Home improvement ==\n{{see also|Home improvement}}\n[[File:Movable shelves built on discarded toy vehicle.jpg|thumb|150px|Shelves attached to a toy vehicle]]\nThe DIY movement is a re-introduction (often to urban and suburban dwellers) of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in the upkeep of a house or apartment, making clothes; maintenance of cars, computers, websites; or any material aspect of living. The philosopher [[Alan Watts]] (from the \"[[Houseboat Summit]]\" panel discussion in a 1967 edition of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'') reflected a growing sentiment:\n\n{{Quotation|Our educational system, in its entirety, does nothing to give us any kind of material competence. In other words, we don't learn how to cook, how to make clothes, how to build houses, how to make love, or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life. The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions. It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat, or some kind of cerebral character.<ref>Watts, Alan et al. \"Houseboat Summit\" in ''The San Francisco Oracle'', issue #7.  San Francisco.</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups. In part, this movement involved the renovation of affordable, rundown older homes. But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s. The young visionary [[Stewart Brand]], working with friends and family, and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, published the first edition of ''The [[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' (subtitled ''Access to Tools'') in late 1968.\n\n[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|thumb|left|Fiberglass dome house, California, in style of the Whole Earth Catalog building techniques]]\n\nThe first ''Catalog'', and its successors, used a broad definition of the term \"tools\". There were informational tools, such as books (often technical in nature), professional journals, courses, classes, and the like. There were specialized, designed items, such as [[carpenters]]' and [[Stonemasonry|masons]]' tools, [[garden tools]], [[welding]] equipment, [[chainsaws]], fiberglass materials and so on \u2014 even early personal computers. The designer [[J. Baldwin]] acted as editor to include such items, writing many of the reviews. The ''Catalog'''s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism, convention-breaking, and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s. Often copied, the ''Catalog'' appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence.\n\nDIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s, first created as collections of magazine articles. An early, extensive line of DIY how-to books was created by [[Sunset Books]], based upon previously published articles from their magazine, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'', based in California. [[Time-Life]], [[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]], [http://balconygardenweb.com/ Balcony Garden Web] and other publishers soon followed suit.\n\n[[File:Electronics World Sep 1959.jpg|thumb|150px|''Electronics World'' 1959, home assembled amplifier]]\nIn the mid-1990s, DIY [[home-improvement]] content began to find its way onto the [[World Wide Web]]. HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information. HomeTips.com, established in early 1995, was among the first Web-based sites to deliver free extensive DIY home-improvement content created by expert authors.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Since the late 1990s, DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites.\n\nIn the 1970s, when home video ([[VCR]]s) came along, DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means. In 1979, the [[PBS]] television series ''[[This Old House]]'', starring [[Bob Vila]], premiered and this spurred a DIY television revolution. The show was immensely popular, educating people on how to improve their living conditions (and the value of their house) without the expense of paying someone else to do (as much of) the work. In 1994, the [[HGTV]] Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada, followed in 1999 by the [[DIY Network]] cable television channel. Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics, from [[home renovation|home improvement]] to [[knitting]]. Such channels have multiple shows showing how to stretch one's budget to achieve professional-looking results (''[[Design Cents]]'', ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', etc.) while doing the work yourself. ''[[Toolbelt Diva]]'' specifically caters to female DIYers.\n\nBeyond magazines and television, the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as ''[[This Old House]]'', [[Martha Stewart]], [[Hometalk]], and the [[DIY Network]]. These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand. The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119074337787638918 ''Wall Street Journal'', September 2007]</ref> The number of homeowners who [[blog]] about their experiences continues to grow, along with DIY websites from smaller organizations.\n\n==Fashion==\n[[File:Mennonite Women Dressmaking Pennsylvania 1942.jpg|thumb|180px|Mennonite woman [[dressmaking]] (1942)]]\nDIY amongst the [[fashion]] community is popular, with ideas being shared on social media such as [[YouTube]] about clothing, jewellery, makeup and hair styles. Techniques include [[distressing]] jeans, bleaching jeans, redesigning an old shirt, and studding [[denim]].\n\nThe concept of DIY has also emerged within the art and design community. The terms, Hacktivist, Craftivist, or maker have been used to describe creatives working within a DIY framework (Busch). Otto von Busch describes ''Hacktivism' as \"[including] the participant in the process of making, [to give] rise to new attitudes within the \u2018maker\u2019 or collaborator\u201d (Busch 49) <ref>von Busch, O.

Busch suggests that by engaging in participatory forms of fashion, consumers are able step away from the idea of \"mass-homogenized \u201cMc-Fashion\u201d [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/04/fashion.shopping (Lee 2003)\".], as fashion Hacktivism allows consumers to play a more active role in engaging with the clothes they wear (Busch 32).\n\n== Subculture ==\n{{main|DIY ethic|Maker culture}}\n\nThe terms \"DIY\" and \"do-it-yourself\" are also used to describe:\n[[File:Zines-fromlondonsymp07.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Zine]]s, London]]\n* [[Self-publishing]] books, [[zines]], and [[alternative comics]]\n* Bands or solo artists releasing their music on self-funded [[record label]]s.\n* Trading of mixtapes as part of [[cassette culture]]\n* Homemade stuffs based on the principles of \"[[Recycle]], [[Reuse]] & [[Reduce (waste)|Reduce]]\" (the [[Waste hierarchy|3R's]]).

DIY is associated with the international [[alternative rock]], [[punk rock]], and [[indie rock]] music scenes, [[indymedia]] networks, [[pirate radio]] stations, and the [[zine]] community. In this context, DIY is related to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in that it offers an alternative to modern [[consumer culture]]'s emphasis on relying on others to satisfy needs. It has also become prevalent in the personal finance. When investing in the stock one can utilize a professional advisor or partake in [[do-it-yourself investing]].\n\n==History==\nItalian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an \"ancient [[IKEA]] building\". The structure was a [[Greek temple|temple-like]] building discovered at [[Tito, Basilicata|Torre Satriano]], near the southern city of [[Potenza]], in [[Basilicata]], a region where local people mingled with [[Greeks]] who settled along the southern coast known as [[Magna Graecia]] and in [[Sicily]] from the 8th century BC onwards. Professor Christopher Smith, director of the [[British School at Rome]], said that the discovery was \"the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way\". Much like the instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the [[Sparta]]n colony of [[Taranto]] in [[Apulia]].<ref>Newsletter of the Hellenic Society of Archaeometry, N.110, May 2010, p.84</ref><ref>[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-came-with-diy-instructions.html Ancient Building Came With DIY Instructions], Discovery News, Mon Apr 26, 2010</ref><ref>[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-greek-temple-do-it-yourself-photos.html Ancient Building Comes with Assembly Instructions, (photos)], Discovery News</ref>\n\nIn North America, there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century. Magazines such as ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' (founded in 1902) and ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'' (founded in 1928) offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills, techniques, tools, and materials. As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions, initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town.\n\n== Home improvement ==\n{{see also|Home improvement}}\n[[File:Movable shelves built on discarded toy vehicle.jpg|thumb|150px|Shelves attached to a toy vehicle]]\nThe DIY movement is a re-introduction (often to urban and suburban dwellers) of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in the upkeep of a house or apartment, making clothes; maintenance of cars, computers, websites; or any material aspect of living. The philosopher [[Alan Watts]] (from the \"[[Houseboat Summit]]\" panel discussion in a 1967 edition of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'') reflected a growing sentiment:\n\n{{Quotation|Our educational system, in its entirety, does nothing to give us any kind of material competence. In other words, we don't learn how to cook, how to make clothes, how to build houses, how to make love, or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life. The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions. It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat, or some kind of cerebral character.<ref>Watts, Alan et al. \"Houseboat Summit\" in ''The San Francisco Oracle'', issue #7.  San Francisco.</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups. In part, this movement involved the renovation of affordable, rundown older homes. But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s. The young visionary [[Stewart Brand]], working with friends and family, and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, published the first edition of ''The [[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' (subtitled ''Access to Tools'') in late 1968.\n\n[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|thumb|left|Fiberglass dome house, California, in style of the Whole Earth Catalog building techniques]]\n\nThe first ''Catalog'', and its successors, used a broad definition of the term \"tools\". There were informational tools, such as books (often technical in nature), professional journals, courses, classes, and the like. There were specialized, designed items, such as [[carpenters]]' and [[Stonemasonry|masons]]' tools, [[garden tools]], [[welding]] equipment, [[chainsaws]], fiberglass materials and so on \u2014 even early personal computers. The designer [[J. Baldwin]] acted as editor to include such items, writing many of the reviews. The ''Catalog'''s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism, convention-breaking, and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s. Often copied, the ''Catalog'' appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence.\n\nDIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s, first created as collections of magazine articles. An early, extensive line of DIY how-to books was created by [[Sunset Books]], based upon previously published articles from their magazine, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'', based in California. [[Time-Life]], [[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]], [http://balconygardenweb.com/ Balcony Garden Web] and other publishers soon followed suit.\n\n[[File:Electronics World Sep 1959.jpg|thumb|150px|''Electronics World'' 1959, home assembled amplifier]]\nIn the mid-1990s, DIY [[home-improvement]] content began to find its way onto the [[World Wide Web]]. HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information. HomeTips.com, established in early 1995, was among the first Web-based sites to deliver free extensive DIY home-improvement content created by expert authors.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Since the late 1990s, DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites.\n\nIn the 1970s, when home video ([[VCR]]s) came along, DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means. In 1979, the [[PBS]] television series ''[[This Old House]]'', starring [[Bob Vila]], premiered and this spurred a DIY television revolution. The show was immensely popular, educating people on how to improve their living conditions (and the value of their house) without the expense of paying someone else to do (as much of) the work. In 1994, the [[HGTV]] Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada, followed in 1999 by the [[DIY Network]] cable television channel. Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics, from [[home renovation|home improvement]] to [[knitting]]. Such channels have multiple shows showing how to stretch one's budget to achieve professional-looking results (''[[Design Cents]]'', ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', etc.) while doing the work yourself. ''[[Toolbelt Diva]]'' specifically caters to female DIYers.\n\nBeyond magazines and television, the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as ''[[This Old House]]'', [[Martha Stewart]], [[Hometalk]], and the [[DIY Network]]. These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand. The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119074337787638918 ''Wall Street Journal'', September 2007]</ref> The number of homeowners who [[blog]] about their experiences continues to grow, along with DIY websites from smaller organizations.\n\n==Fashion==\n[[File:Mennonite Women Dressmaking Pennsylvania 1942.jpg|thumb|180px|Mennonite woman [[dressmaking]] (1942)]]\nDIY amongst the [[fashion]] community is popular, with ideas being shared on social media such as [[YouTube]] about clothing, jewellery, makeup and hair styles. Techniques include [[distressing]] jeans, bleaching jeans, redesigning an old shirt, and studding [[denim]].\n\nThe concept of DIY has also emerged within the art and design community. The terms, Hacktivist, Craftivist, or maker have been used to describe creatives working within a DIY framework (Busch). Otto von Busch describes ''Hacktivism' as \"[including] the participant in the process of making, [to give] rise to new attitudes within the \u2018maker\u2019 or collaborator\u201d (Busch 49) <ref>von Busch, O. Fashion-able, Hacktivism and engaged Fashion Design, PhD Thesis,School of Design and Crafts (HDK), Gothenburg. 2008, https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/17941/3/gupea_2077_17941_3.pdf.</ref> \n. Busch suggests that by engaging in participatory forms of fashion, consumers are able step away from the idea of \"mass-homogenized \u201cMc-Fashion\u201d [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/04/fashion.shopping (Lee 2003)\".], as fashion Hacktivism allows consumers to play a more active role in engaging with the clothes they wear (Busch 32).\n\n== Subculture ==\n{{main|DIY ethic|Maker culture}}\n\nThe terms \"DIY\" and \"do-it-yourself\" are also used to describe:\n[[File:Zines-fromlondonsymp07.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Zine]]s, London]]\n* [[Self-publishing]] books, [[zines]], and [[alternative comics]]\n* Bands or solo artists releasing their music on self-funded [[record label]]s.\n* Trading of mixtapes as part of [[cassette culture]]\n* Homemade stuffs based on the principles of \"[[Recycle]], [[Reuse]] & [[Reduce (waste)|Reduce]]\" (the [[Waste hierarchy|3R's]]).
