It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was J.T. Walsh's final performance and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers david and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow, popular and outgoing, while the introverted David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950\u2019s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David\u2019s knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers\u2019 living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television, but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show\u2019s characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town \u2013 fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion and foreign concepts such as books, fire and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces sex to her peers, many of her classmates go to Lover's Lane to engage in sex, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill\u2019s interest in painting. After learning of sex and [[masturbation]] from Jennifer, Betty pleasures herself while bathing and, upon reaching orgasm, sees color and eventually becomes \"colored\" herself. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged, led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville\u2019s values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill\u2019s nude painting of Betty, done on his malt shop window. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is nearly raped by non-colored teenage boys. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his twin sister, his new girlfriend and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.

It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was J.T. Walsh's final performance and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers David and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow, popular and outgoing, while the introverted David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950\u2019s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David\u2019s knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers\u2019 living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television, but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show\u2019s characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town \u2013 fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion and foreign concepts such as books, fire and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces sex to her peers, many of her classmates go to Lover's Lane to engage in sex, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill\u2019s interest in painting. After learning of sex and [[masturbation]] from Jennifer, Betty pleasures herself while bathing and, upon reaching orgasm, sees color and eventually becomes \"colored\" herself. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged, led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville\u2019s values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill\u2019s nude painting of Betty, done on his malt shop window. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is nearly raped by non-colored teenage boys. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his twin sister, his new girlfriend and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.

Vallejo is geographically the closest North Bay city to the inner [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], so it is sometimes associated with that region. Its population was 115,942 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the tenth most populous city in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the largest in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].\n\nVallejo sits on the northeastern shore of [[San Pablo Bay]], 30 miles north of San Francisco, the northwestern shore of the [[Carquinez Strait]] and the southern end of the [[Napa River]], 15 miles south of Napa. The city is named after General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], a native [[Californio]], leading proponent of California's statehood, and one of the first members of the [[California State Senate]]; the neighboring city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named for his wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo.\n\nVallejo is home to the [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] theme park, the now-defunct [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], and the regional office for Region 5 of the [[United States Forest Service]]. The colleges and universities in Vallejo are [[California Maritime Academy]], the Vallejo Center campus of [[Solano Community College]], and [[Touro University California]].\n\nVallejo's public transit includes the [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]], which regularly runs from [[Vallejo Station|downtown Vallejo]] to the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]]. [[SolTrans]] buses carry passengers around the cities of Vallejo and Benicia, as well as offer express services to [[Fairfield, California]], and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] stations in [[El Cerrito, California]] and [[Walnut Creek, California]]. Evans Transportation buses provide daily service to [[Oakland International Airport]] from a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] hotel adjacent to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evanstransportation.com/|title=Bus and limousine transportation to San Francisco and Oakland airports, charter services, and Napa and Sonoma winery tours from Evans Transportation|website=www.evanstransportation.com|access-date=July 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810233442/http://www.evanstransportation.com/|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo has twice served as the capital of the state of California: once in 1852 and again in 1853, both periods being brief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|title=Vallejo, California - City Information, Fast Facts, Schools, Colleges, and More|website=www.citytowninfo.com|access-date=January 17, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65WMnzMdd?url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|archive-date=February 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo is also known for its naval and wartime history, the [[Zodiac Killer]] mystery, and as the hometown of [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] rappers [[E-40]] and [[Mac Dre]].\n\n== Geography and environment ==\nAccording to [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.5|sqmi|km2}}. Land area is {{convert|30.7|sqmi|km2}}, and {{convert|18.9|sqmi|km2}} (38.09%) is water. The [[Napa River]] flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], in the northeastern part of [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nVallejo is located on the southwestern edge of [[Solano County, California]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in Northern California. Vallejo is accessible by [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and is the location for the northern half of the [[Carquinez Bridge]]. It is also accessible by [[Interstate 780 (California)|Interstate 780]] from neighboring [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, and by [[California State Route 37|Route 37]] from [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to the west. [[California State Route 29|Route 29]] (former [[U.S. Route 40 (California)|U.S. Route 40]]) begins in the city near the Carquinez Bridge and travels north through the heart of the city and beyond into [[Napa County, California|Napa County]], entering neighboring [[American Canyon, California|American Canyon]] and eventually [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\nSeveral faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The [[San Andreas Fault]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are the most [[active fault]]s, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the [[Concord Fault]] to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. Historically there have been local [[cinnabar]] mines in the Vallejo area.<ref>C.Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the Columbus Parkway Widening between Ascot Parkway and the Northgate Development, Vallejo'', Earth Metrics Inc. Report 7853, California State Clearinghouse, Sept, 1989</ref>  The [[Hastings Mine]] and [[St. John's Mine]] contribute ongoing water contamination for [[mercury (element)|mercury]]; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area's spring water. Both [[Rindler Creek]] and [[Blue Rock Springs Creek]] have been affected.\n\nThe city of Vallejo is located 30 miles northeast of San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|title=Distance between Vallejo united states and San Francisco united states|website=www.mapcrow.info|access-date=September 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220448/http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> 22 miles north of Oakland, 56 miles north of San Jose and 52 miles south of Sacramento. Vallejo borders the city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the [[Carquinez Strait]] to the south and the [[San Pablo Bay]] to the west.\n\n== Climate ==\nVallejo has a mild, coastal [[Mediterranean climate]] and can be an average of 10 degrees cooler than nearby inland cities.

The California Archaeological Inventory has indicated that the three Indian sites are located on Sulphur Springs Mountain.\n\n[[File:Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mariano Vallejo, ca. 1880\u201385, founder and city namesake]]\n\nThe city of Vallejo was once part of the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] Mexican land grant of 1843 by Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]] to General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]. The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the north bay region. General Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836. In 1846 independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] which resulted in his imprisonment in [[Sutter's Fort]]. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. General Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California. He was a proponent of reconciliation and statehood after the [[Bear Flag Revolt]], and has a U.S. Navy submarine, the {{USS|Mariano G. Vallejo|SSBN-658}}, named after him.\n\nIn 1850, Vallejo proposed plans for a new city, to be called ''Eureka'', with the capitol, university, botanical garden and other features. After a statewide referendum, his proposal was accepted, although a new name was decided upon: ''Vallejo''. In 1851, a commission appointed by the Senate found a site on a hill that overlooked the bay and could see San Francisco on a clear day, and it was approved for its symbolic strategic value. In 1851, Vallejo was the official state capitol, with the government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. Unfortunately, Vallejo didn't follow through with building a capitol for them to meet in. After being forced to meet in a leaky building, sitting on barrels, they motioned to move sessions to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and served there for the remainder of the session after only 11 days. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named after Vallejo's wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo. After legislature left, the government established a [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] on [[Mare Island]], which helped the town overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Juanita Tamayo Lott|title=Common Destiny: Filipino American Generations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yD8ND6gMUsC&pg=PA2|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4651-6|page=2}}</ref> The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|title=Vallejo Naval & Historic Museum - Welcome!|website=www.vallejomuseum.org|access-date=June 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627095107/http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|archive-date=June 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/mariano_guadalupe_vallejo.html|title=The U.S.-Mexican War .

Vallejo is geographically the closest North Bay city to the inner [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], so it is sometimes associated with that region. Its population was 115,942 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the tenth most populous city in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the largest in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].\n\nVallejo sits on the northeastern shore of [[San Pablo Bay]], 30 miles north of San Francisco, the northwestern shore of the [[Carquinez Strait]] and the southern end of the [[Napa River]], 15 miles south of Napa. The city is named after General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], a native [[Californio]], leading proponent of California's statehood, and one of the first members of the [[California State Senate]]; the neighboring city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named for his wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo.\n\nVallejo is home to the [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] theme park, the now-defunct [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], and the regional office for Region 5 of the [[United States Forest Service]]. The colleges and universities in Vallejo are [[California Maritime Academy]], the Vallejo Center campus of [[Solano Community College]], and [[Touro University California]].\n\nVallejo's public transit includes the [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]], which regularly runs from [[Vallejo Station|downtown Vallejo]] to the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]]. [[SolTrans]] buses carry passengers around the cities of Vallejo and Benicia, as well as offer express services to [[Fairfield, California]], and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] stations in [[El Cerrito, California]] and [[Walnut Creek, California]]. Evans Transportation buses provide daily service to [[Oakland International Airport]] from a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] hotel adjacent to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evanstransportation.com/|title=Bus and limousine transportation to San Francisco and Oakland airports, charter services, and Napa and Sonoma winery tours from Evans Transportation|website=www.evanstransportation.com|access-date=July 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810233442/http://www.evanstransportation.com/|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo has twice served as the capital of the state of California: once in 1852 and again in 1853, both periods being brief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|title=Vallejo, California - City Information, Fast Facts, Schools, Colleges, and More|website=www.citytowninfo.com|access-date=January 17, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65WMnzMdd?url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|archive-date=February 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo is also known for its naval and wartime history, the [[Zodiac Killer]] mystery, and as the hometown of [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] rappers [[E-40]] and [[Mac Dre]].\n\n== Geography and environment ==\nAccording to [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.5|sqmi|km2}}. Land area is {{convert|30.7|sqmi|km2}}, and {{convert|18.9|sqmi|km2}} (38.09%) is water. The [[Napa River]] flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], in the northeastern part of [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nVallejo is located on the southwestern edge of [[Solano County, California]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in Northern California. Vallejo is accessible by [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and is the location for the northern half of the [[Carquinez Bridge]]. It is also accessible by [[Interstate 780 (California)|Interstate 780]] from neighboring [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, and by [[California State Route 37|Route 37]] from [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to the west. [[California State Route 29|Route 29]] (former [[U.S. Route 40 (California)|U.S. Route 40]]) begins in the city near the Carquinez Bridge and travels north through the heart of the city and beyond into [[Napa County, California|Napa County]], entering neighboring [[American Canyon, California|American Canyon]] and eventually [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\nSeveral faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The [[San Andreas Fault]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are the most [[active fault]]s, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the [[Concord Fault]] to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. Historically there have been local [[cinnabar]] mines in the Vallejo area.<ref>C.Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the Columbus Parkway Widening between Ascot Parkway and the Northgate Development, Vallejo'', Earth Metrics Inc. Report 7853, California State Clearinghouse, Sept, 1989</ref>  The [[Hastings Mine]] and [[St. John's Mine]] contribute ongoing water contamination for [[mercury (element)|mercury]]; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area's spring water. Both [[Rindler Creek]] and [[Blue Rock Springs Creek]] have been affected.\n\nThe city of Vallejo is located 30 miles northeast of San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|title=Distance between Vallejo united states and San Francisco united states|website=www.mapcrow.info|access-date=September 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220448/http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> 22 miles north of Oakland, 56 miles north of San Jose and 52 miles south of Sacramento. Vallejo borders the city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the [[Carquinez Strait]] to the south and the [[San Pablo Bay]] to the west.\n\n== Climate ==\nVallejo has a mild, coastal [[Mediterranean climate]] and can be an average of 10 degrees cooler than nearby inland cities. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the northeastern shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from heatwaves than areas directly on or nearer the Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate such as [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland]]. Although slightly less marine, average temperatures range between {{convert|8|C|F}} in January and {{convert|19.8|C|F}} in July.<ref name=\"Weatherbase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=470640&cityname=Vallejo-California-United-States-of-America|title=Vallejo, California Temperature Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=March 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091549/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=470640&cityname=Vallejo-California-United-States-of-America|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> However, summer is very long with July\u2013September being almost equal in historical average temperatures.

The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the north bay region. General Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836. In 1846 independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] which resulted in his imprisonment in [[Sutter's Fort]]. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. General Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California. He was a proponent of reconciliation and statehood after the [[Bear Flag Revolt]], and has a U.S. Navy submarine, the {{USS|Mariano G. Vallejo|SSBN-658}}, named after him.\n\nIn 1850, Vallejo proposed plans for a new city, to be called ''Eureka'', with the capitol, university, botanical garden and other features. After a statewide referendum, his proposal was accepted, although a new name was decided upon: ''Vallejo''. In 1851, a commission appointed by the Senate found a site on a hill that overlooked the bay and could see San Francisco on a clear day, and it was approved for its symbolic strategic value. In 1851, Vallejo was the official state capitol, with the government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. Unfortunately, Vallejo didn't follow through with building a capitol for them to meet in. After being forced to meet in a leaky building, sitting on barrels, they motioned to move sessions to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and served there for the remainder of the session after only 11 days. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named after Vallejo's wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo. After legislature left, the government established a [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] on [[Mare Island]], which helped the town overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Juanita Tamayo Lott|title=Common Destiny: Filipino American Generations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yD8ND6gMUsC&pg=PA2|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4651-6|page=2}}</ref> The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|title=Vallejo Naval & Historic Museum - Welcome!|website=www.vallejomuseum.org|access-date=June 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627095107/http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|archive-date=June 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/mariano_guadalupe_vallejo.html|title=The U.S.-Mexican War .

The player controls an explorer who has obtained an ancient relic and is running from evil demon monkeys who are chasing him. The game was initially released for [[iOS]] devices on August 4, 2011, and later ported to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] systems and [[Windows Phone 8]].\n\nThe game was a commercial success with positive reviews from critics. The success of the game led to a sequel [[Temple Run 2]]. Collaborations with [[Disney]] to create ''Temple Run: Brave'' and ''Temple Run: Oz'',  and a third spin-off in development by Scopely titled, ''Temple Run: Treasure Hunters'' as a [[match-three]] video game. Temple Run also received activity books and a board game, with [[Warner Bros. Studios]] talking with Imangi Studios of a possible film adaptation. The success of the game also inspired many similar games that take their own twist but also copycat games that  copy the ''Temple Run'' gameplay and iconic brand of the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Temple Run gameplay.png|thumb|140px|left|Gameplay]]\nIn ''Temple Run'', the player controls either Guy Dangerous, an explorer, Scarlett Fox, an [[escape artist]], Barry Bones, a city cop, Karma Lee, the fastest runner in the Far East, Montana Smith, the \"second greatest explorer ever\" (referring to [[Indiana Jones]] being the greatest explorer), Francisco Montoya, a Spanish conquistador, or Zack Wonder, a football star. The character chosen will embark on an adventure to seek an ancient and valuable golden [[Cult image|idol]] from an Aztec temple. They will not realize that the temple is inhabited by a family of demonic [[monkey]]s who want to devour them. As the game is an endless running game, there is no end to the temple; the player plays until the character [[Game over|collides into a large obstacle, falls into the water or is overtaken by the demon monkeys]].\n\nWhile the character is running, the player can swipe  left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and/or avoid obstacles. There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running: gold, red, and blue. A gold coin will only add one coin to the player's total number of coins. Red coins are worth two coins, while blue coins are worth three. The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade [[power-up]]s and/or other characters. Coins can also be bought by the player through [[microtransaction|in-app purchase]]s with [[payment]]s of actual [[money]]. When the player needs to turn left or right, the [[touchscreen]] can be swiped in the corresponding direction. If the player wishes to jump over an object, the screen can be swiped upwards; if the player wishes to slide under an object, the screen can be swiped downwards.\n\n==Development==\n''Temple Run'' was designed, programmed and produced by husband-and-wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova with art by Kiril Tchangov.<ref name=\"AboutImangi\" /> The game took a total of four months to develop.<ref name=\"Keith-interview\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/temple-run-the-rough-road-to-a-runaway-success-story/1100-6368469/ | title= Temple Run: The Rough Road to a Runaway Success Story | website= [[GameSpot]]| date= March 27, 2012 | accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> Development began after the financial failure of Imangi Studio's previous game, ''Max Adventure'' and used that game to prototype Temple Run's controls. Imangi Studios wanted to make a quick game with simpler controls in contrast from ''Max Adventure'''s dual analog controls. Keith started the first prototype with making a game where the character is always running and can be controlled by rotating the environment from a top-down perspective. This idea was scrapped due to causing extreme dizziness during testing. To fix the problem, constraints were added so that players can only make 90\u00b0 turns and perspective be fixed behind the character.<ref name=\"Natalia-interview\">{{cite news | url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/06/temple-run-developer-shares-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-making-a-runaway-hit-ios-game/ | title= Temple Run developer shares a behind the scenes look at making a runaway hit iOS game | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date= February 6, 2012 | accessdate= February 8, 2019}}</ref> When it came to the game's aesthetics, multiple ideas were conceptualized but ultimately settled for the character to running on a pathway resembling the [[Great Wall of China]] or [[Aztec architecture|Aztec temple]]. After the temple design was solidified, Imangi Studios questioned the player character's motivation for constantly running without any breaks and came up with the idea of having something chasing him. Imangi Studios originally had the aliens from ''Max Adventure'' as placeholders.<ref name=\"TR-Prototype\">{{cite AV media | date = March 19, 2014 | title = GDC 2014: A Look At 'Temple Run' Prototypes as it Evolved From 'Max Adventure' | url = https://toucharcade.com/2011/06/07/wwdc-2011-temple-run-hands-on-preview-the-latest-from-imangi-studios/ | access-date = February 16, 2019 | publisher = TouchArcade}}</ref> Kiril created the design of evil demon monkeys and gave them skull masks due to his desire of adding skulls in games he's involved in.<ref name=\"Keith-interview\" /> Natalia initially didn't like having evil demon monkeys chasing the player character and found them terrifying.

The player controls an explorer who has obtained an ancient relic and is running from evil demon monkeys who are chasing him. The game was initially released for [[iOS]] devices on August 4, 2011, and later ported to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] systems and [[Windows Phone 8]].\n\nThe game was a commercial success with positive reviews from critics. The success of the game led to a sequel [[Temple Run 2]]. Collaborations with [[Disney]] to create ''Temple Run: Brave'' and ''Temple Run: Oz'',  and a third spin-off in development by Scopely titled, ''Temple Run: Treasure Hunters'' as a [[match-three]] video game. Temple Run also received activity books and a board game, with [[Warner Bros. Studios]] talking with Imangi Studios of a possible film adaptation. The success of the game also inspired many similar games that take their own twist but also copycat games that  copy the ''Temple Run'' gameplay and iconic brand of the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Temple Run gameplay.png|thumb|140px|left|Gameplay]]\nIn ''Temple Run'', the player controls either Guy Dangerous, an explorer, Scarlett Fox, an [[escape artist]], Barry Bones, a city cop, Karma Lee, the fastest runner in the Far East, Montana Smith, the \"second greatest explorer ever\" (referring to [[Indiana Jones]] being the greatest explorer), Francisco Montoya, a Spanish conquistador, or Zack Wonder, a football star. The character chosen will embark on an adventure to seek an ancient and valuable golden [[Cult image|idol]] from an Aztec temple. They will not realize that the temple is inhabited by a family of demonic [[monkey]]s who want to devour them. As the game is an endless running game, there is no end to the temple; the player plays until the character [[Game over|collides into a large obstacle, falls into the water or is overtaken by the demon monkeys]].\n\nWhile the character is running, the player can swipe  left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and/or avoid obstacles. There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running: gold, red, and blue. A gold coin will only add one coin to the player's total number of coins. Red coins are worth two coins, while blue coins are worth three. The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade [[power-up]]s and/or other characters. Coins can also be bought by the player through [[microtransaction|in-app purchase]]s with [[payment]]s of actual [[money]]. When the player needs to turn left or right, the [[touchscreen]] can be swiped in the corresponding direction. If the player wishes to jump over an object, the screen can be swiped upwards; if the player wishes to slide under an object, the screen can be swiped downwards.\n\n==Development==\n''Temple Run'' was designed, programmed and produced by husband-and-wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova with art by Kiril Tchangov.<ref name=\"AboutImangi\" /> The game took a total of four months to develop.<ref name=\"Keith-interview\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/temple-run-the-rough-road-to-a-runaway-success-story/1100-6368469/ | title= Temple Run: The Rough Road to a Runaway Success Story | website= [[GameSpot]]| date= March 27, 2012 | accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> Development began after the financial failure of Imangi Studio's previous game, ''Max Adventure'' and used that game to prototype Temple Run's controls. Imangi Studios wanted to make a quick game with simpler controls in contrast from ''Max Adventure'''s dual analog controls. Keith started the first prototype with making a game where the character is always running and can be controlled by rotating the environment from a top-down perspective. This idea was scrapped due to causing extreme dizziness during testing. To fix the problem, constraints were added so that players can only make 90\u00b0 turns and perspective be fixed behind the character.<ref name=\"Natalia-interview\">{{cite news | url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/06/temple-run-developer-shares-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-making-a-runaway-hit-ios-game/ | title= Temple Run developer shares a behind the scenes look at making a runaway hit iOS game | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date= February 6, 2012 | accessdate= February 8, 2019}}</ref> When it came to the game's aesthetics, multiple ideas were conceptualized but ultimately settled for the character to running on a pathway resembling the [[Great Wall of China]] or [[Aztec architecture|Aztec temple]]. After the temple design was solidified, Imangi Studios questioned the player character's motivation for constantly running without any breaks and came up with the idea of having something chasing him.
