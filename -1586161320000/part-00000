Situated north of [[continental Europe|mainland Europe]], it is about midway between continental Norway and the [[North Pole]]. The islands of the group range from [[74th parallel north|74\u00b0]] to [[81st parallel north|81\u00b0 north]] latitude, and from [[10th meridian east|10\u00b0]] to [[35th meridian east|35\u00b0 east]] longitude. The largest island is [[Spitsbergen]], followed by [[Nordaustlandet]] and [[Edge\u00f8ya]]. While part of the Kingdom of Norway since 1925, Svalbard is not part of geographical [[Norway proper]]; administratively, the archipelago is not part of any [[Counties of Norway|Norwegian county]], but forms an [[unincorporated area]] administered by a [[Governor of Svalbard|governor]] appointed by the Norwegian government, and a special jurisdiction subject to the [[Svalbard Treaty]] that is, unlike Norway proper, outside of the [[Schengen Area]], the [[Nordic Passport Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]]. \n\nSince 2002, Svalbard's main settlement, [[Longyearbyen]], has had an [[Longyearbyen Community Council|elected local government]], somewhat similar to [[List of municipalities of Norway|mainland municipalities]]. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of [[Barentsburg]], the research station of [[Ny-\u00c5lesund]], and the mining outpost of [[Sveagruva]]. [[Ny-\u00c5lesund]] is the [[Northernmost settlements|northernmost settlement in the world with a permanent civilian population]]. Other settlements are farther north, but are populated only by rotating groups of researchers.\n\nThe islands were first used as a [[whaling]] base by whalers who sailed far north in pursuit of whales for [[blubber]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. [[Coal mining]] started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920 recognizes Norwegian [[sovereignty]], and the 1925 [[Svalbard Act]] made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a [[free economic zone]] and a [[demilitarized zone]]. The Norwegian [[Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani|Store Norske]] and the Russian [[Arktikugol]] remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the [[University Centre in Svalbard]] (UNIS) and the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead [[snowmobile]]s, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. [[Svalbard Airport, Longyear]] serves as the main gateway.\n\nThe archipelago features an [[climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]], although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas at the same latitude. The [[flora of Svalbard|flora]] take advantage of the long period of [[midnight sun]] to compensate for the [[polar night]]. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many [[seabird]]s, and also features [[polar bear]]s, [[reindeer]], the [[Arctic fox]], and certain [[marine mammal]]s. [[List of national parks of Norway|Seven national parks]] and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of the archipelago is covered with [[glacier]]s, and the islands feature many mountains and [[fjord]]s.\n\n[[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] are collectively assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code \"SJ\". Both areas are administered by Norway, though they are separated by a distance of over {{convert|950|km|mi nmi|abbr=off}} and have very different administrative structures.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Svalbard comes from an older native name for the archipelago, ''Svalbar\u00f0'', composed of the well-attested Old Norse words ''svalr'' (\"cold\") and ''bar\u00f0'' (\"edge; ridge\"). The name ''Spitsbergen'' originated with Dutch navigator and explorer [[Willem Barentsz]], who described the \"pointed mountains\" or, in Dutch, ''spitse bergen'' that he saw on the west coast of the main island, Spitsbergen. Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago, and consequently the name ''Spitsbergen'' long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf ''In Search of Het Behouden Huys: A Survey of the Remains of the House of Willem Barentsz on Novaya Zemlya'', LOUWRENS HACQUEBORD, p. 250] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327084815/http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}.\n[[:File:Barentsz arctic map.jpg|Detail of Barentsz' 1599 arctic map]], published online by Troms\u00f8 University 1999 as part of the \"Northern Lights Route\" project of the Council of Europe.</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Svalbard}}\nThe Svalbard Treaty of 1920<ref name=cia>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sv.html |title=Svalbard |work=[[World Fact Book]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=15 January 2010 |access-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208001818/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications//the-world-factbook/geos/sv.html |archive-date=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> defines Svalbard as all islands, islets and [[skerry|skerries]] from 74\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 north latitude, and from 10\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 east longitude.<ref name=npi>{{cite news |title=Svalbard |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |url=http://npweb.npolar.no/english/geografi/svalbard |access-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415125926/http://www.npolar.no/en/the-arctic/svalbard/index.html |archive-date=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=treaty>{{cite news |title=Svalbard Treaty |publisher=[[Wikisource]] |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Svalbard_Treaty |date=9 February 1920 |access-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324002033/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Svalbard_Treaty |archive-date=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The land area is {{convert|61022|km2|abbr=on}}, and dominated by the island of Spitsbergen, which constitutes more than half the archipelago, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edge\u00f8ya.<ref name=\"islandsize\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/befsvalbard_en/tab-2009-10-22-01-en.html |title=Population in the settlements.

This group of men were the last German troops to surrender after the Second World War.\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Union proposed common Norwegian and Soviet administration and military defence of Svalbard. This was rejected in 1947 by Norway, which two years later joined [[NATO]].

[[archipelago]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Situated north of [[continental Europe|mainland Europe]], it is about midway between continental Norway and the [[North Pole]]. The islands of the group range from [[74th parallel north|74\u00b0]] to [[81st parallel north|81\u00b0 north]] latitude, and from [[10th meridian east|10\u00b0]] to [[35th meridian east|35\u00b0 east]] longitude. The largest island is [[Spitsbergen]], followed by [[Nordaustlandet]] and [[Edge\u00f8ya]]. While part of the Kingdom of Norway since 1925, Svalbard is not part of geographical [[Norway proper]]; administratively, the archipelago is not part of any [[Counties of Norway|Norwegian county]], but forms an [[unincorporated area]] administered by a [[Governor of Svalbard|governor]] appointed by the Norwegian government, and a special jurisdiction subject to the [[Svalbard Treaty]] that is, unlike Norway proper, outside of the [[Schengen Area]], the [[Nordic Passport Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]]. \n\nSince 2002, Svalbard's main settlement, [[Longyearbyen]], has had an [[Longyearbyen Community Council|elected local government]], somewhat similar to [[List of municipalities of Norway|mainland municipalities]]. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of [[Barentsburg]], the research station of [[Ny-\u00c5lesund]], and the mining outpost of [[Sveagruva]]. [[Ny-\u00c5lesund]] is the [[Northernmost settlements|northernmost settlement in the world with a permanent civilian population]]. Other settlements are farther north, but are populated only by rotating groups of researchers.\n\nThe islands were first used as a [[whaling]] base by whalers who sailed far north in pursuit of whales for [[blubber]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. [[Coal mining]] started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920 recognizes Norwegian [[sovereignty]], and the 1925 [[Svalbard Act]] made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a [[free economic zone]] and a [[demilitarized zone]]. The Norwegian [[Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani|Store Norske]] and the Russian [[Arktikugol]] remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the [[University Centre in Svalbard]] (UNIS) and the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead [[snowmobile]]s, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. [[Svalbard Airport, Longyear]] serves as the main gateway.\n\nThe archipelago features an [[climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]], although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas at the same latitude. The [[flora of Svalbard|flora]] take advantage of the long period of [[midnight sun]] to compensate for the [[polar night]]. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many [[seabird]]s, and also features [[polar bear]]s, [[reindeer]], the [[Arctic fox]], and certain [[marine mammal]]s. [[List of national parks of Norway|Seven national parks]] and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of the archipelago is covered with [[glacier]]s, and the islands feature many mountains and [[fjord]]s.\n\n[[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] are collectively assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code \"SJ\". Both areas are administered by Norway, though they are separated by a distance of over {{convert|950|km|mi nmi|abbr=off}} and have very different administrative structures.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Svalbard comes from an older native name for the archipelago, ''Svalbar\u00f0'', composed of the well-attested Old Norse words ''svalr'' (\"cold\") and ''bar\u00f0'' (\"edge; ridge\"). The name ''Spitsbergen'' originated with Dutch navigator and explorer [[Willem Barentsz]], who described the \"pointed mountains\" or, in Dutch, ''spitse bergen'' that he saw on the west coast of the main island, Spitsbergen. Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago, and consequently the name ''Spitsbergen'' long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf ''In Search of Het Behouden Huys: A Survey of the Remains of the House of Willem Barentsz on Novaya Zemlya'', LOUWRENS HACQUEBORD, p. 250] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327084815/http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}.\n[[:File:Barentsz arctic map.jpg|Detail of Barentsz' 1599 arctic map]], published online by Troms\u00f8 University 1999 as part of the \"Northern Lights Route\" project of the Council of Europe.</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Svalbard}}\nThe Svalbard Treaty of 1920<ref name=cia>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sv.html |title=Svalbard |work=[[World Fact Book]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=15 January 2010 |access-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208001818/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications//the-world-factbook/geos/sv.html |archive-date=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> defines Svalbard as all islands, islets and [[skerry|skerries]] from 74\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 north latitude, and from 10\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 east longitude.<ref name=npi>{{cite news |title=Svalbard |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |url=http://npweb.npolar.no/english/geografi/svalbard |access-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415125926/http://www.npolar.no/en/the-arctic/svalbard/index.html |archive-date=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=treaty>{{cite news |title=Svalbard Treaty |publisher=[[Wikisource]] |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Svalbard_Treaty |date=9 February 1920 |access-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324002033/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Svalbard_Treaty |archive-date=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The land area is {{convert|61022|km2|abbr=on}}, and dominated by the island of Spitsbergen, which constitutes more than half the archipelago, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edge\u00f8ya.<ref name=\"islandsize\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/befsvalbard_en/tab-2009-10-22-01-en.html |title=Population in the settlements.

The settlements continued to operate as before, mining coal and monitoring the weather.\nIn July 1941, following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the [[Royal Navy]] reconnoitred the islands with a view to using them as a base of operations to facilitate sending supplies to north Russia, but the idea was rejected as too impractical.<ref>Roskill Vol I: p388</ref> Instead, with the agreement of the Soviets and the Norwegian government in exile, in August 1941 the Norwegian and Soviet settlements on Svalbard were evacuated, and facilities there destroyed, in [[Operation Gauntlet]].<ref>Arlov (1996): 397</ref><ref>Roskill Vol I: p389</ref>\nHowever the Norwegian government in exile decided it would be important politically to establish a garrison in the islands, which was done in May 1942 during [[Operation Fritham]].<ref>Roskill Vol II: p132-3</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Germans had responded to the destruction of weather station by establishing a reporting station of their own, codenamed [[Operation Bans\u00f6|\"Banso\"]], in October 1941.<ref>Arlov (1996): 400</ref> This was chased away in November by a visit from four British warships, but later returned. A second station, \"Knospel\", was established at [[Ny Alesund]] in 1941, remaining until 1942. In May 1942, after the arrival of the Fritham force, the German unit at Banso was evacuated.\n\nIn September 1943 in [[Operation Zitronella]] a German task force, which included the battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], was sent to attack the garrison and destroy the settlements at Longyearbyen and Barentsburg.<ref>Arlov (1996): 402\u2013403</ref> This was achieved, but had little long-term effect: after their departure the Norwegians returned and re-established their presence.<ref>Roskill Vol III: p62</ref>\n\nIn September 1944, the Germans set up their last weather station, [[Operation Haudegen]] in NordOstLand; this remained functioning until after the German surrender. On 4 September 1945, the soldiers were picked up by a Norwegian seal hunting vessel and surrendered to its captain. This group of men were the last German troops to surrender after the Second World War.\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Union proposed common Norwegian and Soviet administration and military defence of Svalbard. This was rejected in 1947 by Norway, which two years later joined [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union retained high civilian activity on Svalbard, in part to ensure that the archipelago was not used by NATO.<ref>Arlov (1996): 407\u2013408</ref>\n\n==== Post-<span lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">war</span>====\n[[File:Kulltaubane.jpg|right|thumb|Abandoned [[aerial tramway]] previously used for transporting coal]]\n\nAfter the war, Norway re-established operations at Longyearbyen and Ny-\u00c5lesund,<ref>Torkildsen (1984): 206</ref> while the Soviet Union established mining in Barentsburg, [[Pyramiden]] and [[Grumant]].<ref name=t202>Torkildsen (1984): 202</ref> The mine at Ny-\u00c5lesund had several fatal accidents, killing 71 people while it was in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963.

D. Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0. Therefore, it will become 0\u00b0 Aries in the zodiac.\n\nHere is an example from a private letter to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n** Using a scale of one point to one degree, 8729\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 24 + 89\u00b0, and 89\u00b0 is 29\u00b0 Gemini. \n** Using a scale of 30 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/30 = 291\u00b0, and 291\u00b0 is 21\u00b0 Capricorn. \n** Using a scale of 12 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/12 = 727.5\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 2 + 7.5\u00b0, and 7.5\u00b0 is 7\u00b030\u2019 Aries. \n** Using a scale of one cent (100 points) to one degree, 8729\u00b0/100 = 87.29\u00b0, and 87.29\u00b0 is 27\u00b017\u2019 Gemini\n\n=== Gann angles ===\n{{main|Gann angles}}\nGann described the use of angles in the [[stock market]] in ''The Basis of My Forecasting Method'' (1935).

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change.

For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.
