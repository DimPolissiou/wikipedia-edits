This ended in failure, after a fallout with the fans, during which the lead singer Jake \"the Scream\" was infuriated for being taken as kitsch or a comedy band, and was quoted saying \"I'm very unhappy for not being taken seriously. Our music is great art, but people of the west think only western music is great. I'll not be clown of capitalism!\"\n\nAfter the fallout with most European fans, the band withdrew from public for a number of years before making a second bid for success beginning in the late 90\u2019s.

The living have great respect for the dead. In their culture concerning their traditional religion(s) spirits of the dead can assist or hurt the living. It is also believed that since the spirit world is the source of all things in this world everything that lives or is real must be respected. They contain spirits which go by different names such as ghosts, ''taotaomo'na,'' white ladies, among other names.\n\nAs mentioned earlier they had a system called sawei. They would bring materials (offerings) to their \"fathers\" in exchange for \"spiritual protection.\" One of the other reasons why people brought offerings was because of Yapese magicians. They were believed to have power over the weather.\n\nThe stick dance has a religious origin in Chuuk. It is claimed that a spirit taught this centuries ago during a war between two clans.

One of the people to bring Catholicism to them was Father Juan Antonio Cantova in the early 1700s.\n\nIn 1819 a group of Carolinians was told to accept Christianity before moving to Saipan. The agreement (which included other things) was authorized by officials in Manila.\n\n==Family, Gender, & Health==\n\n=== Family ===\nIn 1999 domestic violence was said to be widespread.<ref name=\":1\" /> Female are expected to treat male relatives with respect when they are present.\n\nIn their language there is a term called ''nemin''.

Care Med.}}\n</ref>\n\n== How the qCO is calculated? ==\n\n=== What is the impedance cardiography? ===\nThe Impedance Cardiography (ICG or Ztot) signal represents the changes of the thoracic impedance due to variations in the blood flow. In practice, the raw Ztot signal (in O) is transformed to the \u2013dZ/dt waveform (filtered negative [[first derivative]], in O x s-1) by using the first derivative to remark the [[inflection points]] of the raw Ztot signal. The most important characteristics points of the \u2013dZ/dt waveform are B, C and X points (see figure 2). All these points are associated to distinct physiological events within the systolic part of the [[cardiac cycle]], i.e., located after the [[QRS complex]] onset. In that sense, the R wave from the [[ECG]] signal can be an important reference for detecting such events.\n\n=== Detecting characteristic points of the ICG signal: problems and solutions. ===\nThe ICG signal is extremely sensitive to artefacts due to movements and respiration. Baseline variations can considerably alter the dZ/dtmax point and the dependent hemodynamic parameters. High frequency interferences also can affect the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] in estimating some characteristics points, essentially the B point, affecting the LVET dependent parameters. The qCO's algorithm uses classical and advanced adaptive filtering techniques to minimize such problems with good results. The algorithm applies a [[Band pass filter|band pass filtering stage]], which attenuates both the baseline drifts (due to movement or respiration) and the high-frequency signal. Also, it features [[Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system|Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)]], for higher accuracy, which is able to obliterate even artefacts such as the electrosurgical noise.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Woltjer |first=H.H. |last2=Bogaard |first2=H.J. |last3=de Vries |first3=J.M. |title= The technique of impedance cardiography |volume= 18 |issue=9 |date=1997 |journal=Eur.

Lately, new kinds of methods and devices have been developed. Nowadays, at practice, the method election is determined mainly by the features of the patients and the possibilities of the hospital to accede to this technology.\nDifferent CO monitor methods can be characterized by their invasiveness or their ability to measure continuously. The most ideal should be reliable, continuous, non-invasive, easy to use and cost-effective.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=de Waal |first=E. E. C. |last2=Wappler |first2=F.  |last3=Buhre |first3=F. |title=Cardiac output monitoring |volume= 22 |date=2009 |journal= Curr. Opin. Anesthesiol.}}\n</ref> The invasive methods like the still gold standard method [[Swan-ganz catheter]] ([[pulmonary artery catheter]]), based on transcardiac thermodilution, are being replaced by its invasiveness; hence these systems will not be inspected in this document.\nThe minimally invasive methods also require catheterization, but less harmful. One of them is the [[Cardiac output#Pulmonary artery thermodilution|Thermodilution Transpulmonary (TDTP)]], developed in the late 1990s, which presents risk of [[iatrogenic effect]] effects such as [[pneumothorax]], [[Bleeding]], [[infection]], [[thrombosis]] or [[ischemia|vascular ischemia]], inherent to the requirement of both [[Central venous catheter|arterial and central venous catheter]]. As calibrating method, this system performs a thermodilution curve by measuring the changes in blood temperature due to the injection of cold serum and calculates the CO intermittently through a modified equation of Stewart-Hamilton.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Garc\u00eda |first=X. |last2=Mateu |first2=L.  |last3=Maynar |first3=J. |last4=Mercadal |first4=J. |last5=Ochagav\u00eda |first5=A.|last6=Ferrandiz |first6=A. |title=Estimating cardiac output.

Intensiva}}\n</ref> Furthermore, this method lets a continuous reading of the CO through the analysis of the [[Pulse pressure|arterial Pulse Pressure]] (PP) wave.\nAdmittedly, these systems have some limitations, related for example to the thermodilution, such as thermic artefacts due to the injection of another serums or during the extracorporeal purification treatment (this therapy is required by approximately the 5% of patients in critical areas).<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Maynar |first=J. |title=Dosificaci\u00f3n de f\u00e1rmacos durante los tratamientos de depuraci\u00f3n extracorp\u00f3rea de la sangre |volume= 35 |date=2010 |journal= NefroPlus |pages=20\u201326}}\n</ref> Most of the monitors able to provide a continuous measure of the CO, are based on the analysis of the [[arterial blood pressure]](BP) curve, called pulse contour methods.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Truijen |first=J. |last2=van Lieshout |first2=J.

Furthermore, the values may be modified in patients with [[Intra-aortic balloon pumps|Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP)]] or unstable arterial signal as in cases of severe arrhythmias or [[Ventricular extrasystole|ventricular extrasystolia]]. The signal can be altered also by shock or hypothermia states because of the peripheral vasoconstriction or arterial spasm. Usually for calculating the stroke volume, the methods based on pulse wave analysis need previous and periodic calibrations that must be done in the same patient, which is a drawback.\nThe main non-invasive methods can be classified in two groups. The first group is formed by different variations of the echocardiography and [[Echo Doppler studies|echo-Doppler techniques]] and the second group is comprised by the aortic bioimpedance and bioreactance.\n\n== Benefits of using the qCO ==\nDoppler or echocardiography systems cannot assess the CO continuously. The continuous assessment capability is the major advantage of the qCO device. This is especially important to predict if the patient is fluid responsive in cases of hemodynamic instability or circulatory shock, which can be assessed with a simple test named [[Passive leg raising test|Passive Leg Raising]] (PLR, described in detail below), for which, the quick variations in the CO should be detected.\nAnother benefit is the fact that qCO is fully non-invasive, thus avoiding risks for the patient. Further, it does not need to be calibrated, that allows accelerating and simplifying the monitoring, thereby, providing a large benefit for both the patients and clinicians.\nThe Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) method is influenced by mechanical ventilation, due to changes in the pleural pressure, hence, such monitoring should not be recommended for patients who are not being mechanically ventilated with a regular tidal volume.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Lopes |first=M.

Despite of some clinicians believe that the CO monitor can be introduced only when complications emerge, it is recommended to monitor since before the induction in order to have a baseline.\nFluid administration in the intraoperative period is part of the daily practice in anaesthesiology. Several studies have demonstrated that the time of administering fluid therapy can be more important than the volume dispensed; thus the treatment guided by BP is primitive, whereas the functional parameters CO and SV can detect easily and quickly the preload variations\nIn the branch of medicine intensive care, the CO and other related parameters may be useful for the differential diagnosis of shock states such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic or septic.\n\n===The Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)===\nThe rise of volume is the main therapy elected to improve oxygen delivery. However, approximately, only 50% of subjects respond to fluids by increasing SV. The treatment of non-responsive patients can promote deleterious effects in the pulmonary system due to the increase in extravascular fluid. Hence it is important to have a tool to determine this condition.\nIt is called SVV to the physiological variations, due to changes in intra-thoracic pressure of spontaneous breathing, which diminish the arterial pulse pressure during inspiration and increase it during inspiration; however if the SVV decreases too much, it can be termed paradoxical pulse, and can be related to different pathologies such EPOC or pericarditis.\nIn mechanically ventilated patients, the same process takes place in reverse, due to the positive pressure. Therefore, the normal values of SVV depend on the ventilation mode, and it can be calculated through the SV with the formula: <math> SVV= (SV_{max} - SV_{min}) / SV_{mean} </math>, by a respiratory cycle or other period of time.\nDuring mechanical ventilation the goal is to maintain SVV between 10-15%, higher values along with a low SV may indicate the need of volume resuscitation.\n\n[[File:Stroke volume decresing.png|450px|center]]\n\nSVV may be fairly sensitive and specific used as a dynamic indicator of the volume status to answer the question: \u201cIs your patient fluid responsive?\u201d, compared to the conventional parameters. However, using the SVV should not be recommended to interpret the situation of patients with arrhythmias or vasodilator therapy. Also, to avoid natural variations, the patients must be under mechanical ventilation.\n\n==Therapy and methods==\n\n===The Goal Directed Therapy (GDT)===\nA critical point for the fluid management in some medical specialties is to adjust the intravascular volume replacement. An incorrect practice can seriously affect the organ function and hence the outcome. Guiding fluid management using standard physiologic variables such as BP and HR, because of their regulated nature, is usually insensitive to changes in intravascular volume and may be misleading for example occulting a hypo-perfusion state. Therefore, optimizing the cardiac preload with fluid administration guided by BP is not reliable.\n\nWith the formula to achieve objectives, called Goal Directed Therapy (GDT), Rivers (2001) demonstrated how to reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock through the optimization of different haemodynamic variables for a dynamic and individualized view, instead of maintaining only an adequate Arterial Pressure (AP). Later publications support that the intraoperative GDT, used to maintain an adequate systemic oxygenation, can safeguard organs especially sensible from perioperative hypo-perfusion. High risk patients or even less pernicious patients to major surgery could profit from GDT by reducing incidence of postoperative complications, thus, improving and accelerating the outcome.\n\nThe CO measurement in cardiology provides rewarding diagnostic and prognostic information for the management of patients with left- and right-sided cardiac dysfunction. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) may diminish the CO and promote right-sided heart failure, which untreated could be fatal. A simultaneous measurement of the preload also enables to assay the blood flow levels to discard states of hypovolemia or hypervolemia.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Rivers |first=E. |title= Early goal-directed therapy in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock |volume= 345 |issue=19 |date=2001 |journal= N.

Another option is the passive leg raising test, which consists of inducing a fast and transient hemodynamic challenge without fluid infusion. By modifying the patient's position, a volume of venous blood from the lower body toward the right heart it is transferred, simulating an infusion of approximately 300ml.\n\n[[File:Passive Leg Raising test.png|thumb|center| Figure 3: For maximal reliability, the PLR test must be performed following some rules. One possible variation of PLR starts from the semi-recumbent position 1. The second step comprises to go down the trunk and raise legs maintaining the angle between them using the automatic motion of the bed for avoiding artefacts. Finally the third step goes back to position 1 to ensure that the subject recovers the previous hemodynamic parameters.| 500px]]\n\nAn increase in the CO (of = 10%) and AP within the next 60\u201390 seconds after leg elevation indicates a positive result, suggesting that the patient is fluid responsive and might benefit from additional fluid. By contrast if the test is negative, the patient should not be treated as it would be harmful. The fluid overload can raise extravascular water causing deleterious side effects in lungs.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Monnet |first=X. |last2=Teboul |first2=J. |title= Passive leg raising?: five rules, not a drop of fluid! |date=2015 | pages= 1\u20133}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:CO Incresing.png|400px|center]]\n\n===The Frank Starling\u2019s curve===\nThe basic mechanisms for the haemodynamic regulation are:\n* Intrinsically cardiac regulation in function of the venous return.\n* Control of HR by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).\n\nThe explanation why the heart is capable of adapting to growing volumes of blood flow is called 'Frank-Starling's mechanism', which says that the more distended are the muscle during the filling, the more strength of contraction and quantity of blood pumped by the left-ventricle to the aorta. When the heart reaches a physiological limitation, then blood pumping cannot increase, although the venous return is further increased. The SVV contributes to know the state of volemia in ventilated patients and designates the point on the Frank-Starling curve where the patient is.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mateu Campos |first=M.L. |last2=Ferr\u00e1ndiz Sell\u00e9s |first2=A. |last3= Gruartmoner de Vera |first3=G. |last4=Mesquida Febrer |first4=J. |last5=Sabatier Cloarec |first5=C. |last6=Poveda Hern\u00e1ndez |first6=Y. |last7=Garc\u00eda Nogales |first7=X. |title= Techniques available for hemodynamic monitoring.

Nowadays, it has become a widely used tool for study the ANS modulation in clinical areas such as cardiology. Even though, its utility is not well known yet. The interest lies in its profound relation with the breathing, ANS and cardiac autonomic regulation.\n\nThe most relevant and validated capacity is to prognosticate the coronary heart disease patients, accordingly, a reduced HRV is related to high risk of mortality after a myocardial infarction.\nAnother important point is the fact that the Inflammation is stimulated by effect of the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibited by the sympathetic, thereby, could also be measured through the R-R intervals to guide the physician.\n\nSeveral reports maintain that the HRV analysis is a highly accurate indicator of the autonomic dysfunction in alcoholic and diabetic subjects. Also, it is growing the interest in apply the HRV to evaluate the neurologic function, and the best results have been found out in the psychiatric patients.\nRegarding the anaesthesia and critical care fields, the ANS dysfunction should be considered because it is related to high morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia effect. Naturally, events as the tracheal intubation and inhalation agents can produce quick variations in ANS. Also, should be regarded in critical patients who may show a worse outcome when it is added to certain illnesses such as sepsis [24,25].\n<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mazzeo AT |first=S.L. |last2=La Monaca |first2=E. |last3= Di Leo |first3=R. |last4=Vita |first4=G. |title= Heart rate variability: a diagnostic and prognostic tool in anesthesia and intensive care |volume= 55 | issue = 7  |date=2011 |journal=  Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. | pages= 797\u2013811 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02466.x|pmid=21658013 }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Huang |first=H.H. |last2=Chan |first2=H.L. |last3= Lin |first3=L. |last4=Wu |first4=C.P. |last5=Huang |first5=C.H. |title= Time-frequency spectral analysis of heart rate variability during induction of general anaesthesia |volume= 79 |issue=6 |date=1997 |journal=  Br.

In practice, the raw Ztot signal (in O) is transformed to the \u2013dZ/dt waveform (filtered negative [[first derivative]], in O x s-1) by using the first derivative to remark the [[inflection points]] of the raw Ztot signal. The most important characteristics points of the \u2013dZ/dt waveform are B, C and X points (see figure 2). All these points are associated to distinct physiological events within the systolic part of the [[cardiac cycle]], i.e., located after the [[QRS complex]] onset. In that sense, the R wave from the [[ECG]] signal can be an important reference for detecting such events.\n\n=== Detecting characteristic points of the ICG signal: problems and solutions. ===\nThe ICG signal is extremely sensitive to artefacts due to movements and respiration. Baseline variations can considerably alter the dZ/dtmax point and the dependent hemodynamic parameters. High frequency interferences also can affect the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] in estimating some characteristics points, essentially the B point, affecting the LVET dependent parameters. The qCO's algorithm uses classical and advanced adaptive filtering techniques to minimize such problems with good results. The algorithm applies a [[Band pass filter|band pass filtering stage]], which attenuates both the baseline drifts (due to movement or respiration) and the high-frequency signal. Also, it features [[Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system|Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)]], for higher accuracy, which is able to obliterate even artefacts such as the electrosurgical noise.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Woltjer |first=H.H. |last2=Bogaard |first2=H.J. |last3=de Vries |first3=J.M. |title= The technique of impedance cardiography |volume= 18 |issue=9 |date=1997 |journal=Eur.

The X reveals the closing of aortic valve (identified as local minima after C point) and the LVET (Left-Ventricular Ejection Time) is the time interval between the opening and closure of the aortic valve, i.e., the interval between the points B and X.\n<!-- and so on, to a maximum of 10 images (image10) -->\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = <!-- left (default), center, right -->\n | footer            = \n}}\n\n== Foundation and features of the different methods.==\nSince its discovery, the use of CO monitoring has been restricted to certain kind of patients because of the risk of the classical procedures. Lately, new kinds of methods and devices have been developed. Nowadays, at practice, the method election is determined mainly by the features of the patients and the possibilities of the hospital to accede to this technology.\nDifferent CO monitor methods can be characterized by their invasiveness or their ability to measure continuously. The most ideal should be reliable, continuous, non-invasive, easy to use and cost-effective.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=de Waal |first=E. E.

One of them is the [[Cardiac output#Pulmonary artery thermodilution|Thermodilution Transpulmonary (TDTP)]], developed in the late 90's, which presents risk of [[iatrogenic effect]] effects such as [[pneumothorax]], [[Bleeding]], [[infection]], [[thrombosis]] or [[ischemia|vascular ischemia]], inherent to the requirement of both [[Central venous catheter|arterial and central venous catheter]]. As calibrating method, this system performs a thermodilution curve by measuring the changes in blood temperature due to the injection of cold serum and calculates the CO intermittently through a modified equation of Stewart-Hamilton.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Garc\u00eda |first=X. |last2=Mateu |first2=L.  |last3=Maynar |first3=J. |last4=Mercadal |first4=J. |last5=Ochagav\u00eda |first5=A.|last6=Ferrandiz |first6=A. |title=Estimating cardiac output.

Furthermore, the values may be modified in patients with [[Intra-aortic balloon pumps|Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP)]] or unstable arterial signal as in cases of severe arrhythmias or [[Ventricular extrasystole|ventricular extrasystolia]]. The signal can be altered also by shock or hypothermia states because of the peripheral vasoconstriction or arterial spasm. Usually for calculating the stroke volume, the methods based on pulse wave analysis need previous and periodic calibrations that must be done in the same patient, which is a drawback.\nThe main non-invasive methods can be classified in two groups. The first group is formed by different variations of the echocardiography and [[Echo Doppler studies|echo-Doppler techniques]] and the second group is comprised by the aortic bioimpedance and bioreactance.\n\n== Benefits of using the qCO ==\nDoppler or echocardiography systems cannot assess the CO continuously. The continuous assessment capability is the major advantage of the qCO device. This is especially important to predict if the patient is fluid responsive in cases of hemodynamic instability or circulatory shock, which can be assessed with a simple test named [[Passive leg raising test|Passive Leg Raising]] (PLR, described in detail below), for which, the quick variations in the CO should be detected.\nAnother benefit is the fact that qCO is fully non-invasive, thus avoiding risks for the patient. Further, it does not need to be calibrated, that allows accelerating and simplifying the monitoring, thereby, providing a large benefit for both the patients and clinicians.\nThe Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) method is influenced by mechanical ventilation, due to changes in the pleural pressure, hence, such monitoring should not be recommended for patients who are not being mechanically ventilated with a regular tidal volume.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Lopes |first=M.

The SV in turn, depends on three general factors: [[Preload (cardiology)|pre-load]], [[Afterload|post-load]] and [[myocardial contractility]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Possible causes for <u>increasing</u> CO:\t!! Possible causes for <u>decreasing</u> CO:\n|-\n| Increased demand of O2. (I.e. during exercise).\t|| Deficit of ventricular filling.(Can be caused by hypovolemia).\n|-\n| States of decreased [[Vascular resistance|Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)]]. (I.e. systemic inflammation).\t|| Low ventricular emptying.  <br />(Caused by e.g. contractility alteration, valvulopathy).\n|-\n| Increased [[sympathetic response]]. (I.e. pain, fear or anxiety states).\t|| High Systemic Vascular Resistance. (E.g. caused by hypertension, vasoconstriction, and mitral insufficiency).\n|-\n| Other states such as pregnancy, liver disease and hyperthyroidism.\t||\n|}\n\nIn the field of anaesthesia the main reason for CO monitoring during surgery are complications that can arise after the immediate postoperative period (such as hypoxemia, tachycardia or oliguria) and also, if the therapeutic intervention becomes complex. Despite of some clinicians believe that the CO monitor can be introduced only when complications emerge, it is recommended to monitor since before the induction in order to have a baseline.\nFluid administration in the intraoperative period is part of the daily practice in anaesthesiology. Several studies have demonstrated that the time of administering fluid therapy can be more important than the volume dispensed; thus the treatment guided by BP is primitive, whereas the functional parameters CO and SV can detect easily and quickly the preload variations\nIn the branch of medicine intensive care, the CO and other related parameters may be useful for the differential diagnosis of shock states such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic or septic.\n\n===The Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)===\nThe rise of volume is the main therapy elected to improve oxygen delivery. However, approximately, only 50% of subjects respond to fluids by increasing SV. The treatment of non-responsive patients can promote deleterious effects in the pulmonary system due to the increase in extravascular fluid. Hence it is important to have a tool to determine this condition.\nIt is called SVV to the physiological variations, due to changes in intra-thoracic pressure of spontaneous breathing, which diminish the arterial pulse pressure during inspiration and increase it during inspiration; however if the SVV decreases too much, it can be termed paradoxical pulse, and can be related to different pathologies such EPOC or pericarditis.\nIn mechanically ventilated patients, the same process takes place in reverse, due to the positive pressure. Therefore, the normal values of SVV depend on the ventilation mode, and it can be calculated through the SV with the formula: <math> SVV= (SV_{max} - SV_{min}) / SV_{mean} </math>, by a respiratory cycle or other period of time.\nDuring mechanical ventilation the goal is to maintain SVV between 10-15%, higher values along with a low SV may indicate the need of volume resuscitation.\n\n[[File:Stroke volume decresing.png|450px|center]]\n\nSVV may be fairly sensitive and specific used as a dynamic indicator of the volume status to answer the question: \u201cIs your patient fluid responsive?\u201d, compared to the conventional parameters. However, using the SVV should not be recommended to interpret the situation of patients with arrhythmias or vasodilator therapy. Also, to avoid natural variations, the patients must be under mechanical ventilation.\n\n==Therapy and methods==\n\n===The Goal Directed Therapy (GDT)===\nA critical point for the fluid management in some medical specialties is to adjust the intravascular volume replacement. An incorrect practice can seriously affect the organ function and hence the outcome. Guiding fluid management using standard physiologic variables such as BP and HR, because of their regulated nature, is usually insensitive to changes in intravascular volume and may be misleading for example occulting a hypo-perfusion state. Therefore, optimizing the cardiac preload with fluid administration guided by BP is not reliable.\n\nWith the formula to achieve objectives, called Goal Directed Therapy (GDT), Rivers (2001) demonstrated how to reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock through the optimization of different haemodynamic variables for a dynamic and individualized view, instead of maintaining only an adequate Arterial Pressure (AP). Later publications support that the intraoperative GDT, used to maintain an adequate systemic oxygenation, can safeguard organs especially sensible from perioperative hypo-perfusion. High risk patients or even less pernicious patients to major surgery could profit from GDT by reducing incidence of postoperative complications, thus, improving and accelerating the outcome.\n\nThe CO measurement in cardiology provides rewarding diagnostic and prognostic information for the management of patients with left- and right-sided cardiac dysfunction. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) may diminish the CO and promote right-sided heart failure, which untreated could be fatal. A simultaneous measurement of the preload also enables to assay the blood flow levels to discard states of hypovolemia or hypervolemia.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Rivers |first=E. |title= Early goal-directed therapy in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock |volume= 345 |issue=19 |date=2001 |journal= N.

Another option is the passive leg raising test, which consists of inducing a fast and transient hemodynamic challenge without fluid infusion. By modifying the patient's position, a volume of venous blood from the lower body toward the right heart it is transferred, simulating an infusion of approximately 300ml.\n\n[[File:Passive Leg Raising test.png|thumb|center| Figure 3: For maximal reliability, the PLR test must be performed following some rules. One possible variation of PLR starts from the semi-recumbent position 1. The second step comprises to go down the trunk and raise legs maintaining the angle between them using the automatic motion of the bed for avoiding artefacts. Finally the third step goes back to position 1 to ensure that the subject recovers the previous hemodynamic parameters.| 500px]]\n\nAn increase in the CO (of = 10%) and AP within the next 60\u201390 seconds after leg elevation indicates a positive result, suggesting that the patient is fluid responsive and might benefit from additional fluid. By contrast if the test is negative, the patient should not be treated as it would be harmful. The fluid overload can raise extravascular water causing deleterious side effects in lungs.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Monnet |first=X. |last2=Teboul |first2=J. |title= Passive leg raising?: five rules, not a drop of fluid! |date=2015 | pages= 1\u20133}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:CO Incresing.png|400px|center]]\n\n===The Frank Starling\u2019s curve===\nThe basic mechanisms for the haemodynamic regulation are:\n* Intrinsically cardiac regulation in function of the venous return.\n* Control of HR by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).\n\nThe explanation why the heart is capable of adapting to growing volumes of blood flow is called 'Frank-Starling's mechanism', which says that the more distended are the muscle during the filling, the more strength of contraction and quantity of blood pumped by the left-ventricle to the aorta. When the heart reaches a physiological limitation, then blood pumping cannot increase, although the venous return is further increased. The SVV contributes to know the state of volemia in ventilated patients and designates the point on the Frank-Starling curve where the patient is.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mateu Campos |first=M.L. |last2=Ferr\u00e1ndiz Sell\u00e9s |first2=A. |last3= Gruartmoner de Vera |first3=G. |last4=Mesquida Febrer |first4=J. |last5=Sabatier Cloarec |first5=C. |last6=Poveda Hern\u00e1ndez |first6=Y. |last7=Garc\u00eda Nogales |first7=X. |title= Techniques available for hemodynamic monitoring.

Nowadays, it has become a widely used tool for study the ANS modulation in clinical areas such as cardiology. Even though, its utility is not well known yet. The interest lies in its profound relation with the breathing, ANS and cardiac autonomic regulation.\n\nThe most relevant and validated capacity is to prognosticate the coronary heart disease patients, accordingly, a reduced HRV is related to high risk of mortality after a myocardial infarction.\nAnother important point is the fact that the Inflammation is stimulated by effect of the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibited by the sympathetic, thereby, could also be measured through the R-R intervals to guide the physician.\n\nSeveral reports maintain that the HRV analysis is a highly accurate indicator of the autonomic dysfunction in alcoholic and diabetic subjects. Also, it is growing the interest in apply the HRV to evaluate the neurologic function, and the best results have been found out in the psychiatric patients.\nRegarding the anaesthesia and critical care fields, the ANS dysfunction should be considered because it is related to high morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia effect. Naturally, events as the tracheal intubation and inhalation agents can produce quick variations in ANS. Also, should be regarded in critical patients who may show a worse outcome when it is added to certain illnesses such as sepsis [24,25].\n<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mazzeo AT |first=S.L. |last2=La Monaca |first2=E. |last3= Di Leo |first3=R. |last4=Vita |first4=G. |title= Heart rate variability: a diagnostic and prognostic tool in anesthesia and intensive care |volume= 55 | issue = 7  |date=2011 |journal=  Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. | pages= 797\u2013811 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02466.x|pmid=21658013 }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Huang |first=H.H. |last2=Chan |first2=H.L. |last3= Lin |first3=L. |last4=Wu |first4=C.P. |last5=Huang |first5=C.H. |title= Time-frequency spectral analysis of heart rate variability during induction of general anaesthesia |volume= 79 |issue=6 |date=1997 |journal=  Br.

He was perceived as a hero by his troops, as he sought glory for himself and his army and independence for Mexico. He repeatedly rebuilt his reputation after major losses.

''The Oxford History of Mexico'' (2000) p. 322</ref>  His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing half its territory, beginning with the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836 and culminating with the [[Mexican Cession]] of 1848 following its loss to the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. But his leadership in the Mexican-American War and his willingness to fight to the bitter end prolonged the war. \"More than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter.

He was overthrown by the liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]] in 1855 and lived most of his later years in exile.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAntonio de Padua Mar\u00eda Severino L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna y P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n was born in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], [[New Spain|Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain), on 21 February 1794. He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing. According to Mexican historian [[Enrique Krauze]], \"It annoyed him and bored him, and perhaps frightened him.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 137.</ref> A biographer of Santa Anna described him in this period as the \"absentee president.\"<ref>Fowler, Will. ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', chapter 7, \"The Absentee President, 1832-1835\", pp. 133-157</ref> Santa Anna's vice president, civilian liberal, medical doctor, [[Valent\u00ednG\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], took over the responsibility of the governing of the nation. Santa Anna retired to his Veracruz hacienda, [[Manga de Clavo]]. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11 million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress. \n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30-40,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released. The treaty was a major turning point in Santa Anna's career, as it meant the end of Mexican sovereignty in Texas.<ref>animatedatlas.com/mexwar/santaanna.html\" 'Treaty' Between Santa Anna and Texas\"</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSanta Anna rode double into Sam Houston's camp on the horse of [[Joel Walter Robison]], a soldier in most of the battles and later a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro42\n|title=Robison, Joel Walter|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing Texas president [[David G. Burnet]] and Santa Anna signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], the latter under duress, stating that \"in his official character as chief of the Mexican nation, he acknowledged the full, entire, and perfect Independence of the Republic of Texas.\" In exchange, Burnet and the Texas government guaranteed Santa Anna's safety and transport to Veracruz. During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842.

Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844.

Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end.

Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853.

He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsden thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>   \n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba.

Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s's dowry allowed Santa Anna to purchase the first of his haciendas, Manga de Clavo, in Veracruz state.<ref name=fowler58/><ref>Potash, Robert. \"Testaments de Santa Anna.\" ''Historia Mexicana'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 430\u2013440.</ref>\n\nThe wife of the first Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Fanny Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and her husband visited with Santa Anna's first wife In\u00e9s at Manga de Clavo, where they were well-received with a breakfast banquet.  Mme. Calder\u00f3n de la Barca observed that \"After breakfast, the Se\u00f1ora having dispatched an officer for her cigar-case, which was gold with a diamond latch, offered me a cigar, which I having declined, she lighted her own, a little paper 'cigarette', and the gentlemen followed her good example.\"<ref>Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, F.

The couple rarely lived together; de Tosta resided primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities took him around the country.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}} They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that de Tosta was infertile.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}}\n\nSeveral women claimed to have borne Santa Anna [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] children. In his will, Santa Anna acknowledged and made provisions for four: Paula, Mar\u00eda de la Merced, Petra, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. Biographers have identified three more: Pedro L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, and \u00c1ngel and Augustina Rosa L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=92}}\n\n==Later years and death==\n[[File:Tumbasantaanna.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and his second wife, Sra. Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna]]\n\nFrom 1855 to 1874, Santa Anna lived in exile in Cuba, the United States, Colombia, and the then Danish island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]].  He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character. Later that year a schooner owned by Gilbert Thompson, son-in-law of [[Daniel Tompkins]], brought Santa Anna to his home in [[Staten Island, New York]],<ref>[https://nypost.com/2011/11/13/mex-generals-staten-ex-isle/ Mex general\u2019s Staten ex-isle] Retrieved 22 November 2018</ref> where he tried to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City.\n\n[[File: Casa de Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.JPG|thumb|The house in [[Mexico City]] where Santa Anna spent the last years of his life and wrote most of his memoirs.]]\n\n[[Thomas Adams (chewing gum maker)|Thomas Adams]], the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the U.S., experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber. He bought one ton of the substance from Santa Anna, but his experiments proved unsuccessful. Instead, Adams helped to found the chewing gum industry with a product that he called \"[[chiclets]].\"<ref name=\"Staten\">[http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084919/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 |date=27 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his many years in exile, Santa Anna was a passionate fan of the sport of [[cockfighting]]. He had many roosters that he entered into competitions, and would have his roosters compete with cocks from all over the world.<ref name=\":0\" /> He would invite breeders from all over the world for matches and is known to have spent tens of thousands of dollars on prize [[rooster]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn 1874, he took advantage of a general amnesty and returned to Mexico. Crippled and almost blind from [[cataracts]], he was ignored by the Mexican government that same year at the anniversary of the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. Having retreated from politics in 1855, he remained disconnected until his death in 1876.<ref name=\":0\" /> Santa Anna died at his home in Mexico City on 21 June 1876 at age 82. He was buried with full military honors in a glass coffin in Pante\u00f3n del Tepeyac Cemetery.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mexico}}\n*[[List of heads of state of Mexico]]\n*[[History of democracy in Mexico]]\n\n==Note==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|title=On Art, Artists, Latin America, and Other Utopias |last=Camnitzer |first=Luis |editor-last=Weiss |editor-first=Rachel |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780292783492 |page=199 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsotPY30RfkC&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|title=Tornel and Santa Anna: the writer and the caudillo, Mexico, 1795\u20131853\n |last=Fowler |first=Will|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group\n |year=2000|isbn=978-0-313-30914-4|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftOV3nd78KQC&pg=PA20}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv\n |last=Fowler|first=Will|title=Santa Anna of Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFszaXaypkoC|accessdate=17 August 2012\n |date=1 November 2009|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-2638-8}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |language=Spanish\n |last=Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero |first=Enrique\n |authorlink=Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero\n |title=Pa\u00eds de un solo hombre: el M\u00e9xico de Santa Anna.

Beezley, eds. ''The Oxford History of Mexico'' (2000) p. 322</ref>  His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing half its territory, beginning with the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836 and culminating with the [[Mexican Cession]] of 1848 following its loss to the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. But his leadership in the Mexican-American War and his willingness to fight to the bitter end prolonged the war. \"More than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter.

He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing. According to Mexican historian [[Enrique Krauze]], \"It annoyed him and bored him, and perhaps frightened him.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 137.</ref> A biographer of Santa Anna described him in this period as the \"absentee president.\"<ref>Fowler, Will.

Santa Anna retired to his Veracruz hacienda, [[Manga de Clavo]]. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11 million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget. On Santa Anna's suggestion, the number of battalions was to be reduced as well as the number of generals and brigadiers.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 145.</ref>  \n\nA law was issued, the ''Ley del Caso'' that called for the arrest of 51 politicians, including former president Bustamante for holding \"unpatriotic\" beliefs and ordered them expelled from the republic.

The plan called for repeal the ''Ley del Caso'' and urged lack of tolerance for the influence of [[Masonic lodges]], where politics was pursued in secrecy; declared void the laws passed by Congress and the local legislatures in favor of the reforms; requested the protection of President Santa Anna to fulfill the plan, and recognize him as the only authority; removal from office the deputies and officials who carried out enforcement of the reform laws and decrees; and provide military force to support the president in implementing the plan.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |language=Spanish |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wq5LbA_fwugC&pg=PA379\n |last=Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero |first=Enrique\n |authorlink=Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero\n |title=Pa\u00eds de un solo hombre: el M\u00e9xico de Santa Anna.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress. \n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30-40,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released. The treaty was a major turning point in Santa Anna's career, as it meant the end of Mexican sovereignty in Texas.<ref>animatedatlas.com/mexwar/santaanna.html\" 'Treaty' Between Santa Anna and Texas\"</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSanta Anna rode double into Sam Houston's camp on the horse of [[Joel Walter Robison]], a soldier in most of the battles and later a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro42\n|title=Robison, Joel Walter|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing Texas president [[David G.

During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842. The new Congress was composed of men of principles who vigorously opposed the autocratic leader.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3338755|title = Generals versus Politicians: Santa Anna and the 1842 Congressional Elections in Mexico|journal = Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 257\u2013274|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1989|doi = 10.2307/3338755}}</ref>\n\nTrying to restore the treasury, Santa Anna raised taxes, but this aroused resistance. Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844. The buried leg he left behind in the capital was dug up by a mob and dragged through the streets until nothing was left of it.{{sfn|Camnitzer|2009}}{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=239}} Fearing for his life, he tried to elude capture, but in January 1845 he was apprehended by a group of Native Americans near [[Xico, Veracruz]]. They turned him over to authorities, and Santa Anna was imprisoned. His life was spared, but he was exiled to [[Cuba]], still a Spanish colony.\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War, 1846\u20131848                                                           ===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1870.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna circa 1870.]]\n[[File:Nebel Mexican War 07 Battle of Churubusco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Churubusco]], during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], 20 August 1847]]\n\nIn 1846, Mexican and American troops moved towards the Rio Grande into the disputed [[Nueces Strip]]. Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end.

Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853. Santa Anna honored his promises to the Church, revoking a decree denying protection for the fulfillment of monastic vows, a reform promulgated twenty years earlier during the era of [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. President Santa Anna had left running the government in 1833 to his liberal vice president.<ref name=mecham-358-59>Mecham, ''Church and State'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had been expelled from Spanish realms by the crown in 1767, were allowed to return to Mexico ostensibly to educate poorer classes, and much of their property, which the crown had confiscated and sold, was restored to them.<ref name=mecham-358-59/>\n\nAlthough he gave himself exalted titles, Santa Anna's situation was quite vulnerable. He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsen thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>   \n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Juan Cordero - Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|'' Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna'' by [[Juan Cordero]], 1855.

When Iturbide as Mexican emperor lost support, Santa Anna had been in the forefront of leaders seeking to oust him. Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s's dowry allowed Santa Anna to purchase the first of his haciendas, Manga de Clavo, in Veracruz state.<ref name=fowler58/><ref>Potash, Robert. \"Testaments de Santa Anna.\" ''Historia Mexicana'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 430\u2013440.</ref>\n\nThe wife of the first Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Fanny Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and her husband visited with Santa Anna's first wife In\u00e9s at Manga de Clavo, where they were well-received with a breakfast banquet.

The couple rarely lived together; de Tosta resided primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities took him around the country.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}} They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that de Tosta was infertile.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}}\n\nSeveral women claimed to have borne Santa Anna [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] children.

He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character. Later that year a schooner owned by Gilbert Thompson, son-in-law of [[Daniel Tompkins]], brought Santa Anna to his home in [[Staten Island, New York]],<ref>[https://nypost.com/2011/11/13/mex-generals-staten-ex-isle/ Mex general\u2019s Staten ex-isle] Retrieved 22 November 2018</ref> where he tried to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City.\n\n[[File: Casa de Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.JPG|thumb|The house in [[Mexico City]] where Santa Anna spent the last years of his life and wrote most of his memoirs.]]\n\n[[Thomas Adams (chewing gum maker)|Thomas Adams]], the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the U.S., experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber.
