Due to new construction, and the expectation that the turnpike pays for policing and maintenance, this has never come to pass.\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe task of building the turnpike was not an easy one. One major problem was the construction in the city of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], where either 450&nbsp;homes or 32&nbsp;businesses would be destroyed, depending on the chosen route. The engineers decided to go through the residential area, since they considered it the grittiest and the closest route to both Newark Airport and the [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]] seaport.\n\n[[File:NJ-TurnpikeSwamp.JPG|thumb|NJ Turnpike passes the swampy [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Meadowlands]], near New York City]]\nWhen construction finally got to Newark, there was the new challenge of deciding to build either over or under the [[Pulaski Skyway]].

Gradually, the water was brought up, and drained into adjacent meadows. Then, construction of the two major bridges over the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers was completed.

The section through New Jersey was to be constructed and maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, while the section in New York was to be built and maintained by the New York Thruway Authority.\n\nThe purpose of this extension was to give motorists a \"more direct bypass of the New York City area\" to New England, by using the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. The extension was to parallel [[New York State Route&nbsp;303]] (NY&nbsp;303) and the present-day CSX [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|River Line]], and have limited interchanges. It was to have an interchange with the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] and at I-87 (New York State Thruway) in West Nyack.

Every toll lane on the turnpike accepts E-ZPass.\n[[File:New Jersey Turnpike toll gate.jpg|thumb|left|A New Jersey Turnpike tollgate for exit 8A in [[Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey|Monroe Township]]]]\nWhen traveling from the north, drivers who exit from the southbound Western Spur onto the ramp for dedicated access to the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] pay no toll, but the NJTA counts cars electronically and is paid a fee for each vehicle by the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]].\n\nThe non-tolled [[Interstate 295 (Delaware\u2013New Jersey)|I-295]], which parallels the turnpike for much of its southern length, is often used as an alternate route for [[shunpiking]] by locals and through travelers alike; before the expansion of the exit&nbsp;1 toll plaza, this route was promoted through signage and radio announcements from the [[New Jersey State Police]] as a bypass of summer congestion at the plaza.\n\n== Exit list ==\n\n=== Mainline, Eastern Spur, and I-95 Extension ===\n{{jcttop|exit|state=NJ|length_ref=<ref name=\"sld 1\" /><ref name=\"sld 0\" />}}\n{{NJint|exit\n|county=Salem\n|cspan=6\n|location=Pennsville Township\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=NJ|I|295|US|40|dir1=south|dir2=west|name2=[[Delaware Memorial Bridge]]|location1=[[Delaware]]}}\n|notes=Southern terminus;

Here, the turnpike is cosigned with [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;40]] and has three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. A northbound entrance from Old Pennsville-Auburn Road is provided near an NJDOT fuel station to the south of the highway. Soon afterwards, the turnpike crosses the Salem Canal, and the northbound lanes of I-295 cross over the turnpike. Heading east, US&nbsp;40 leaves the highway at an interchange with [[New Jersey Route 140|Route&nbsp;140]] and [[County Route 540 (New Jersey)|County Route&nbsp;540]] (CR&nbsp;540). The turnpike heads northeast from this point into wooded areas as a four-lane controlled-access highway with a {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. After crossing over [[Game Creek (New Jersey)|Game Creek]], the turnpike reaches the Exit&nbsp;1 Toll Plaza, where northbound drivers must obtain a ticket, and southbound drivers must surrender their ticket and pay the proper toll. Two Express [[E-ZPass]] lanes are provided in each direction. Paralleling I-295, the turnpike continues north/northeast through rural [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]] with two lanes in each direction. After passing under [[New Jersey Route 48|Route&nbsp;48]], the turnpike enters [[Oldmans Township, New Jersey|Oldmans Township]], where it has the John Fenwick Service Area northbound and the Clara Barton Service Area southbound. The turnpike then briefly enters [[Pilesgrove Township, New Jersey|Pilesgrove Township]] before crossing the [[Oldmans Creek]] into [[Woolwich Township, New Jersey|Woolwich Township]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester County]].<ref name=\"sld 0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nContinuing northeast, the turnpike crosses the [[Southern Railroad of New Jersey]]'s [[Salem Branch]] before passing to the south of [[Swedesboro, New Jersey|Swedesboro]]. After crossing the [[Raccoon Creek (New Jersey)|Raccoon Creek]], the highway reaches an interchange for [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;322]]. A maintenance yard is present on the northbound side of the turnpike immediately north of the interchange. The route then heads northeast into [[East Greenwich Township, New Jersey|East Greenwich Township]] past farmland before crossing Edwards Creek. Here, the turnpike passes by residential developments and soon crosses the [[Mantua Creek]] into [[West Deptford Township, New Jersey|West Deptford Township]], where it passes through parkland before development near the route increases substantially. After passing under [[New Jersey Route 45|Route&nbsp;45]], the turnpike enters [[Woodbury Heights, New Jersey|Woodbury Heights]], where it passes by homes before crossing [[Conrail Shared Assets Operations]]' (CSAO) [[Vineland Secondary]] and entering [[Deptford Township, New Jersey|Deptford Township]]. Here, the turnpike passes under [[New Jersey Route 47|Route&nbsp;47]] before crossing the [[Big Timber Creek]]. Immediately northeast of this point, the turnpike passes under [[New Jersey Route 42|Route&nbsp;42]] and enters the [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] borough of [[Bellmawr, New Jersey|Bellmawr]]. After passing to the south of an industrial park, the turnpike enters [[Runnemede, New Jersey|Runnemede]] and comes to an exit for [[New Jersey Route 168|Route&nbsp;168]] ([[Black Horse Pike]]), serving the city of [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] to the north. Immediately after the interchange, the turnpike crosses back into Bellmawr before entering [[Barrington, New Jersey|Barrington]], where it passes under [[New Jersey Route 41|Route&nbsp;41]].

Upon entering [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]], the turnpike passes over tracks carrying the [[PATCO Speedline]] and [[NJ Transit]]'s [[Atlantic City Line]] before the southbound lanes have the Walt Whitman Service Area. Continuing northeast, the turnpike passes under [[New Jersey Route 70|Route&nbsp;70]] before crossing the [[Pennsauken Creek]] into [[Mount Laurel, New Jersey|Mount Laurel]], where it has an exit for [[New Jersey Route 73|Route&nbsp;73]]. North of this point, the turnpike has three lanes in each direction. Still running within close proximity of I-295, the turnpike comes to a [[New Jersey State Police]] station and passes under [[New Jersey Route 38|Route&nbsp;38]] before crossing CSAO's Pemberton Industrial Track. After the northbound James Fenimore Cooper Service Area, the road crosses over [[Rancocas Creek]] and passes to the northwest of [[Rancocas State Park]]. Now in [[Westampton, New Jersey|Westampton Township]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], the distance between I-295 and the turnpike increases, and the turnpike reaches an exit for [[County Route 541 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;541]] (Burlington-Mount Holly Road). Northeast of this point, the turnpike continues as a six-lane highway into [[Burlington Township, New Jersey|Burlington Township]], where it passes by houses and the Burlington Country Club before entering [[Springfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey|Springfield Township]].

Due to new construction, and the expectation that the turnpike pays for policing and maintenance, this has never come to pass.\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe task of building the turnpike was not an easy one. One major problem was the construction in the city of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], where either 450&nbsp;homes or 32&nbsp;businesses would be destroyed, depending on the chosen route. The engineers decided to go through the residential area, since they considered it the grittiest and the closest route to both Newark Airport and the [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]] seaport.\n\n[[File:NJ-TurnpikeSwamp.JPG|thumb|NJ Turnpike passes the swampy [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Meadowlands]], near New York City]]\nWhen construction finally got to Newark, there was the new challenge of deciding to build either over or under the [[Pulaski Skyway]]. If construction went above the skyway, the costs would be much higher. If they went under, the costs would be lower, but the roadway would be very close to the Passaic River, making it harder for ships to pass through. The turnpike was ultimately built to pass under.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E1FF83858107A93C2AB178AD85F468585F9 |title = City Linked to Super-Highway |last = Schwab |first = Armand, Jr. |work = The New York Times |date = January 20, 1952 |page = X17 |access-date = September 25, 2010 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121001163201/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E1FF83858107A93C2AB178AD85F468585F9 |archive-date = October 1, 2012 |df = mdy-all |url-access=subscription  }}</ref><ref>[[#Hart|Hart]], pp. 173\u2013174.{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}</ref> As part of a 2005 [[seismic retrofit]] project, the NJTA lowered its roadway to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width [[shoulder (road)|shoulders]], which had been constrained by the location of the skyway supports.<ref>{{cite web |author = [[American Council of Engineering Companies]] of New Jersey |publisher = American Council of Engineering Companies of New Jersey |url = http://www.acecnj.org/Docs/2006%20acec%20award%20program.pdf |title = 35th Annual Engineering Excellence Awards Dinner program |date = March 6, 2006 |access-date = October 27, 2007 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090304194923/http://www.acecnj.org/Docs/2006%20acec%20award%20program.pdf |archive-date = March 4, 2009 }}</ref> Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the bridge by {{convert|4|ft|m|spell=in}}, without shutting down traffic.

Gradually, the water was brought up, and drained into adjacent meadows. Then, construction of the two major bridges over the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers was completed.

The section through New Jersey was to be constructed and maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, while the section in New York was to be built and maintained by the New York Thruway Authority.\n\nThe purpose of this extension was to give motorists a \"more direct bypass of the New York City area\" to New England, by using the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. The extension was to parallel [[New York State Route&nbsp;303]] (NY&nbsp;303) and the present-day CSX [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|River Line]], and have limited interchanges. It was to have an interchange with the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] and at I-87 (New York State Thruway) in West Nyack.

Originally a top-10 list of tracks that garnered the largest audience response in [[New York City]] [[discoth\u00e8que]]s, the chart began on October 26, 1974 under the title ''Disco Action''.  The chart went on to feature playlists from various cities around the country from week to week. ''Billboard'' continued to run regional and city-specific charts throughout 1975 and 1976 until the issue dated August 28, 1976, when a 30-position ''National Disco Action Top 30'' premiered.  This quickly expanded to 40 positions, then in 1979 the chart expanded to 60 positions, then 80, and eventually reached 100 positions from 1979 until 1981, when it was reduced to 80 again.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003|isbn=0-89820-156-X|publisher=Record Research|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 1980s the chart maintained 80 slots until March 16, 1985 when the Disco charts were splintered and renamed. Two charts appeared: ''Hot Dance/Disco'', which ranked club play (50 positions), and ''[[Hot Dance Singles Sales|Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]]'', which ranked [[12-inch single]] (or maxi-single) sales (also 50 positions, later reduced to 10 and discontinued after 2013, replaced with [[Dance/Electronic Digital Songs]]).\n\nOnly ''Hot Dance Club Songs'' still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Hot+Dance+Singles+Sales |title=\u2013 Charts \u2013 Singles \u2013 Hot Dance Singles Sales |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref>  In 2003 ''Billboard'' introduced the '''Hot Dance Airplay''' chart (now known as '''[[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]'''), which is based solely on radio airplay of six dance music stations and top 40 mix shows electronically monitored by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Hot+Dance+Airplay |title=\u2013 Charts \u2013 Singles \u2013 Hot Dance Airplay |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref> These stations are also a part of the electronically monitored panel that encompasses the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].\n\nOn January 26, 2013, ''Billboard'' added a new chart, '''[[Dance/Electronic Songs]]''', which tracks the 50 most popular Dance and Electronic singles and tracks based on digital single sales, streaming, radio airplay, and club play as reported on the component Dance/Electronic Digital Songs, Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs, and Dance Club Songs charts.

Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.  In 1978, four tracks from ''[[Thank God It's Friday (soundtrack)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' ([[Donna Summer]], [[Pattie Brooks]], [[Love & Kisses]], [[Sunshine (American band)|Sunshine]]); in 1980, three tracks from ''[[Fame (soundtrack)|Fame]]'' (two by [[Irene Cara]] and one by [[Linda Clifford]]); and in 1985, two songs from ''[[Beverly Hills Cop#Soundtrack|Beverly Hills Cop]]'' ([[Patti LaBelle]], [[Harold Faltermeyer]]) hit number one together.\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] additionally became the first act to have scored at least one No. 1 on the Dance Club Songs chart in five separate decades since the chart's inception in 1976, having tallied 9 in the 1980s, 13 in the '90s, 18 in the 2000s, 9 in the '10s and, now, one (so far) in the '20s.\n*[[The Trammps]] are the only act to replace themselves at number one (issue date June 5, 1976, \"That's Where the Happy People Go\" \u2192 \"Disco Party\").<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The longest running number-ones on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart are \"[[Bad Luck (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Bad Luck]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]{{sup|2}} in 1975 and the album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' by [[Michael Jackson]].

Originally a top-10 list of tracks that garnered the largest audience response in [[New York City]] [[discoth\u00e8que]]s, the chart began on October 26, 1974 under the title ''Disco Action''.  The chart went on to feature playlists from various cities around the country from week to week. ''Billboard'' continued to run regional and city-specific charts throughout 1975 and 1976 until the issue dated August 28, 1976, when a 30-position ''National Disco Action Top 30'' premiered.  This quickly expanded to 40 positions, then in 1979 the chart expanded to 60 positions, then 80, and eventually reached 100 positions from 1979 until 1981, when it was reduced to 80 again.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003|isbn=0-89820-156-X|publisher=Record Research|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 1980s the chart maintained 80 slots until March 16, 1985 when the Disco charts were splintered and renamed. Two charts appeared: ''Hot Dance/Disco'', which ranked club play (50 positions), and ''[[Hot Dance Singles Sales|Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]]'', which ranked [[12-inch single]] (or maxi-single) sales (also 50 positions, later reduced to 10 and discontinued after 2013, replaced with [[Dance/Electronic Digital Songs]]).\n\nOnly ''Hot Dance Club Songs'' still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Hot+Dance+Singles+Sales |title=\u2013 Charts \u2013 Singles \u2013 Hot Dance Singles Sales |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref>  In 2003 ''Billboard'' introduced the '''Hot Dance Airplay''' chart (now known as '''[[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]'''), which is based solely on radio airplay of six dance music stations and top 40 mix shows electronically monitored by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Hot+Dance+Airplay |title=\u2013 Charts \u2013 Singles \u2013 Hot Dance Airplay |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref> These stations are also a part of the electronically monitored panel that encompasses the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].\n\nOn January 26, 2013, ''Billboard'' added a new chart, '''[[Dance/Electronic Songs]]''', which tracks the 50 most popular Dance and Electronic singles and tracks based on digital single sales, streaming, radio airplay, and club play as reported on the component Dance/Electronic Digital Songs, Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs, and Dance Club Songs charts.

[[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.

Even though many local people were against unannounced quartering, sentiment throughout the county remained in favor of the British crown. The quartering of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Nathan Hale]] was captured by the British on the shore of [[Flushing Bay]] in Queens before being executed by hanging in [[Manhattan]] for gathering intelligence.\n\nFrom 1683 until 1784, Queens County consisted of five towns: Flushing, [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]], [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], Newtown, and [[Town of Oyster Bay, New York|Oyster Bay]]. On April 6, 1784, a sixth town, the [[Town of North Hempstead, New York|Town of North Hempstead]], was formed through secession by the northern portions of the Town of Hempstead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyqueen2/History.htm |title=Geographic History of Queens County |first=Walter |last=Greenspan |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.rays-place.com/ny/queens-towns.htm |title=Towns in Queens County, NY; From: Gazetteer of the State of New York |first=J.

that provides for a strong [[mayor\u2013council government|mayor\u2013council system]]. The centralized New York City government is responsible for [[New York City Department of Education|public education]], correctional institutions, [[public safety]], recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Queens. The [[Queens Library]] is governed by a 19-member Board of Trustees, who are appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City]] and the [[Borough President]] of Queens.\n\nSince 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Queens' Borough President is [[Melinda Katz]], elected in November 2013 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with 80.3% of the vote. [[Queens Borough Hall]] is the seat of government and is located in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]].\n\nThe Democratic Party holds most public offices. Sixty-three percent of registered Queens voters are Democrats. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development. Controversial political issues in Queens include development, noise, and the cost of housing.\n\n[[File:Queens County Courthouse by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Queens County Courthouse]] was built in 1938 and houses the borough's Supreme Court, Surrogate Court and County Clerk.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/about/queens_supreme.shtml |title= Queens Supreme Court |website= NYC.gov |year= 2019 |accessdate= March 20, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190502113114/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/about/queens_supreme.shtml |archive-date= May 2, 2019 |url-status= dead }}</ref>]]\n\nEach of the city's five counties has its criminal court system and [[District Attorney]], the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. [[Richard A. Brown]], who ran on both the Republican and Democratic Party tickets, was the [[Queens County District Attorney (New York)|District Attorney of Queens County]] from 1991\u20132018. The new DA as of January 2020 is [[Melinda Katz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queensda.org/ |title=Home |website=Queens DA.org |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> Queens has 12 seats on the [[New York City Council]], the second-largest number among the five boroughs. It is divided into 14 community districts, each served by a local [[Community Boards of Queens|Community Board]]. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for residents.\n\nAlthough Queens is heavily Democratic, it is considered a swing county in New York politics. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political candidates who do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections. Republicans such as former Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]] won majorities in Queens. Republican State Senator [[Serphin Maltese]] represented a district in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo. In 2002, Queens voted against incumbent Republican [[Governor of New York]] [[George Pataki]] in favor of his Democratic opponent, [[Carl McCall]] by a slim margin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2002/general/2002_gov.pdf|title=2002 Election Results: Governor and Lieutenant Governor|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n\nOn the national level, Queens has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1972, when Queens voters chose [[Richard Nixon]] over [[George McGovern]]. Since the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential election]], Democratic presidential candidates have received over 70% of the popular vote in Queens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2000/wpres2000.pdf|title=2000 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2004/president04.pdf|title=2004 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2008/General/PresidentVicePresident08.pdf|title=2008 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2012/General/President_07292013.pdf|title=2012 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2016/General/2016President.pdf|title=2016 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}</ref> Since the [[election of Donald Trump]], Queens has become known in the United States for its surge in [[progressivism|progressive]] politics and grassroots campaigning.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Venugopal |first1=Arun |title=Why Queens Is the Center of the Nation's Progressive Movement |work=[[WNYC]] |date=June 28, 2019 |url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/how-queens-became-center-progressive-movement/ |language=en |accessdate=June 29, 2019 |df=mdy-all |quote=Previously known to outsiders as Brooklyn's more-diverse, less-hip neighbor, a vast landscape of ethnic eateries, Queens has emerged as the capitol of the nation's progressive movement. }}</ref>\n\n===Representatives in the U.S. Congress===\nIn 2018, seven Democrats represented Queens in the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"govtrack.us 2018\">{{cite web | title=New York Senators, Representatives, and Congressional District Maps | website=GovTrack.us | date=May 21, 2018 | url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/NY#representatives | access-date=December 29, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Thomas Suozzi]] (first elected in 2016) represents [[New York's 3rd congressional district]], which covers the northeast Queens neighborhoods of [[Little Neck, Queens|Little Neck]], [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], [[Glen Oaks, Queens|Glen Oaks]], and [[Floral Park, Queens|Floral Park]].

In 2004, Queens had 15.2% (440,310) of all private-sector jobs in New York City and 8.8% of private-sector wages. Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs, with occupations spread relatively evenly across the health care, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and [[film production|film]] and [[television production]] sectors, such that no single sector is overwhelmingly dominant.<ref name=\"state1\"/>\n\nThe diversification in Queens' economy is reflected in a large amount of employment in the [[export-oriented economy|export-oriented]] portions of its economy\u2014such as transportation, manufacturing, and business services\u2014that serve customers outside the region. This accounts for more than 27% of all Queens jobs and offers an average salary of $43,727, 14% greater than that of jobs in the locally oriented sector.\n\nThe borough's largest employment sector\u2014trade, transportation, and utilities\u2014accounted for nearly 30% of all jobs in 2004. Queens is home to two of the three major New York City area airports, [[JFK International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]]. These airports are among the busiest in the world, leading the airspace above Queens to be the most congested in the country. This airline industry is particularly important to the economy of Queens, providing almost one-quarter of the sector's employment and more than 30% of the sector's wages.\n\nEducation and health services are the next largest sector in Queens and comprised almost 24% of the borough's jobs in 2004. The manufacturing and construction industries in Queens are the largest of the City and account for nearly 17% of the borough's private sector jobs.

Nearly all roadways oriented north\u2013south are \"Streets\", while east\u2013west roadways are \"Avenues\", beginning with the number 1 in the west for Streets and the north for Avenues. In some parts of the borough, several consecutive streets may share numbers (for instance, 72nd Street followed by 72nd Place and 72nd Lane, or 52nd Avenue followed by 52nd Road, 52nd Drive, and 52nd Court), often confusing non-residents.<ref name=\"SARAH 2000\">{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Kershaw |title=Meet Me At 60th And 60th; Many Drivers Find Streets of Queens A Confusing Maze |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 15, 2000 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/nyregion/meet-me-at-60th-and-60th-many-drivers-find-streets-of-queens-a-confusing-maze.html | access-date=August 13, 2017}}</ref> Also, incongruous alignments of street grids, unusual street paths due to geography, or other circumstances often lead to the skipping of numbers (for instance, on Ditmars Boulevard, 70th Street is followed by Hazen Street which is followed by 49th Street). Numbered roads tend to be residential, although numbered commercial streets are not rare. A fair number of streets that were country roads in the 18th and 19th centuries (especially major thoroughfares such as [[New York State Route 25A|Northern Boulevard]], [[Queens Boulevard]], [[Hillside Avenue (Queens)|Hillside Avenue]], and [[Jamaica Avenue (Queens)|Jamaica Avenue]]) carry names rather than numbers, typically though not uniformly called \"Boulevards\" or \"Parkways\".\n\nQueens [[house numbering]] was designed to provide convenience in locating the address itself; the first half of a number in a Queens address refers to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or lot number from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th Street and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This pattern doesn't stop when a street is named, assuming that there is an existing numbered cross-street. For example, [[Queens College]] is situated at 65\u201330 Kissena Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance is 65th Avenue.<ref name=\"SARAH 2000\"/>\n\nMany of the village street grids of Queens had only worded names, some were numbered according to local numbering schemes, and some had a mix of words and numbers. In the early 1920s, a \"Philadelphia Plan\" was instituted to overlay one numbered system upon the whole borough. The Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens, worked out the details. Subway stations were only partly renamed, and some, including those along the [[IRT Flushing Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}), now share dual names after the original street names.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.junipercivic.com/historyArticle.asp?nid=74#.VHXch8m25KK |title=Bringing Order Out of Chaos in Street Naming and House Numbering |last=Powell |first=Charles U., Engineer in Charge, Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens |date=February 1928}}</ref> In 2012, some numbered streets in the [[Douglaston Hill Historic District]] were renamed to their original names, with 43rd Avenue becoming Pine Street.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/nyregion/in-douglaston-queens-turning-away-from-numbered-streets.html?src=recg |title=In Queens, Taking a Step Back From Numbered Streets |first=Sarah Maslin |last=Nir |date=March 26, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Rockaway Peninsula does not follow the same system as the rest of the borough and has its own numbering system. Streets are numbered in ascending order heading west from near the Nassau County border, and are prefixed with the word \"Beach.\" Streets at the easternmost end, however, are nearly all named. [[Bayswater, Queens|Bayswater]], which is on Jamaica Bay, has its numbered streets prefixed with the word \"Bay\" rather than \"Beach\". Another deviation from the norm is [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]]; it maintains the north\u2013south numbering progression but uses only the suffix \"Road,\" as well as the prefixes \"West\" and \"East,\" depending on location relative to [[Cross Bay Boulevard (Queens)|Cross Bay Boulevard]], the neighborhood's major through street. Broad Channel's streets were a continuation of the mainland Queens grid in the 1950s; formerly the highest-numbered avenue in Queens was 208th Avenue rather than today's 165th Avenue in Howard Beach & Hamilton Beach. The other exception is the neighborhood of Ridgewood, which for the most part shares a grid and [[house numbering]] system with the Brooklyn neighborhood of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]]. The grid runs east\u2013west from the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]] [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] to Flushing Avenue; and north\u2013south from Forest Avenue in Ridgewood to Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn before adjusting to meet up with the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] grid at Broadway. All streets on the grid have names.\n\n====Bridges and tunnels====\n{{see also|List of bridges and tunnels in New York City}}\n[[File:Hell Gate and Triborough Bridges New York City Queens.jpg|thumb|The [[Triborough Bridge]] connects Queens with Manhattan and the Bronx.]]\nQueens is connected to the Bronx by the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], the [[Triborough Bridge]] (also known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]]. Queens is connected to Manhattan Island by the Triborough Bridge, the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and the [[Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel]], as well as to [[Roosevelt Island]] by the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]].\n\nWhile most of the Queens/Brooklyn border is on land, the [[Kosciuszko Bridge]] crosses the [[Newtown Creek]] connecting [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]] to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. The [[Pulaski Bridge]] connects [[McGuinness Boulevard]] in Greenpoint to 11th Street, Jackson Avenue, and Hunters Point Avenue in [[Long Island City]]. The J. J. Byrne Memorial Bridge (a.k.a. [[Greenpoint Avenue Bridge]]) connects the sections of [[Greenpoint Avenue]] in Greenpoint and Long Island City. A lesser bridge connects [[Grand Street and Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue in Queens to Grand Street in Brooklyn]].\n\nThe [[Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge]], built in 1939, traverses Jamaica Bay to connect the Rockaway Peninsula to [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]] and the rest of Queens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/crossbay.html |title=Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge |website=[[MTA Bridges and Tunnels]] |access-date=July 5, 2016 |quote=In 1939 the New York City Parkway Authority built the Cross Bay Bridge and Parkway, along with beach improvements in the Rockaways.}}</ref> Constructed in 1937, the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] links [[Flatbush Avenue]], Brooklyn's longest thoroughfare, with [[Jacob Riis Park]] and the western end of the Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/marine.html |title=Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge |website=MTA Bridges and Tunnels |access-date=July 5, 2016 |quote=The Marine Parkway Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge was opened by the Marine Parkway Authority in 1937 to provide access to the Rockaway Peninsula, which previously could be reached only by ferry or by a circuitous route around the eastern end of Jamaica Bay.}}</ref> Both crossings were built and continue to be operated by what is now known as [[MTA Bridges and Tunnels]]. The [[IND Rockaway Line]] parallels the Cross Bay, has a mid-bay station at [[Broad Channel (IND Rockaway Line)|Broad Channel]] which is just a short walk from the [[Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge]], now part of [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] and a major stop on the [[Atlantic Flyway]].\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in New York City|List of high schools in New York City#Queens}}\n\n===Elementary and secondary education===\nElementary and secondary school education in Queens is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions.

Queens, like the rest of what became New York City and Long Island, remained under British occupation after the Battle of Long Island in 1776 and was occupied throughout most of the rest of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Under the [[Quartering Act]], British soldiers used, as [[barracks]], the public inns and uninhabited buildings belonging to Queens residents. Even though many local people were against unannounced quartering, sentiment throughout the county remained in favor of the British crown. The quartering of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

that provides for a strong [[mayor\u2013council government|mayor\u2013council system]]. The centralized New York City government is responsible for [[New York City Department of Education|public education]], correctional institutions, [[public safety]], recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Queens. The [[Queens Library]] is governed by a 19-member Board of Trustees, who are appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City]] and the [[Borough President]] of Queens.\n\nSince 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Queens' Borough President is [[Melinda Katz]], elected in November 2013 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with 80.3% of the vote. [[Queens Borough Hall]] is the seat of government and is located in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]].\n\nThe Democratic Party holds most public offices. Sixty-three percent of registered Queens voters are Democrats. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development. Controversial political issues in Queens include development, noise, and the cost of housing.\n\n[[File:Queens County Courthouse by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Queens County Courthouse]] was built in 1938 and houses the borough's Supreme Court, Surrogate Court and County Clerk.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/about/queens_supreme.shtml |title= Queens Supreme Court |website= NYC.gov |year= 2019 |accessdate= March 20, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190502113114/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/about/queens_supreme.shtml |archive-date= May 2, 2019 |url-status= dead }}</ref>]]\n\nEach of the city's five counties has its criminal court system and [[District Attorney]], the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. [[Richard A. Brown]], who ran on both the Republican and Democratic Party tickets, was the [[Queens County District Attorney (New York)|District Attorney of Queens County]] from 1991\u20132018. The new DA as of January 2020 is [[Melinda Katz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queensda.org/ |title=Home |website=Queens DA.org |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> Queens has 12 seats on the [[New York City Council]], the second-largest number among the five boroughs. It is divided into 14 community districts, each served by a local [[Community Boards of Queens|Community Board]]. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for residents.\n\nAlthough Queens is heavily Democratic, it is considered a swing county in New York politics. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political candidates who do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections. Republicans such as former Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]] won majorities in Queens. Republican State Senator [[Serphin Maltese]] represented a district in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo. In 2002, Queens voted against incumbent Republican [[Governor of New York]] [[George Pataki]] in favor of his Democratic opponent, [[Carl McCall]] by a slim margin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2002/general/2002_gov.pdf|title=2002 Election Results: Governor and Lieutenant Governor|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n\nOn the national level, Queens has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1972, when Queens voters chose [[Richard Nixon]] over [[George McGovern]]. Since the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential election]], Democratic presidential candidates have received over 70% of the popular vote in Queens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2000/wpres2000.pdf|title=2000 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2004/president04.pdf|title=2004 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2008/General/PresidentVicePresident08.pdf|title=2008 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2012/General/President_07292013.pdf|title=2012 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2016/General/2016President.pdf|title=2016 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}</ref> Since the [[election of Donald Trump]], Queens has become known in the United States for its surge in [[progressivism|progressive]] politics and grassroots campaigning.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Venugopal |first1=Arun |title=Why Queens Is the Center of the Nation's Progressive Movement |work=[[WNYC]] |date=June 28, 2019 |url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/how-queens-became-center-progressive-movement/ |language=en |accessdate=June 29, 2019 |df=mdy-all |quote=Previously known to outsiders as Brooklyn's more-diverse, less-hip neighbor, a vast landscape of ethnic eateries, Queens has emerged as the capitol of the nation's progressive movement. }}</ref>\n\n===Representatives in the U.S. Congress===\nIn 2018, seven Democrats represented Queens in the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"govtrack.us 2018\">{{cite web | title=New York Senators, Representatives, and Congressional District Maps | website=GovTrack.us | date=May 21, 2018 | url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/NY#representatives | access-date=December 29, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Thomas Suozzi]] (first elected in 2016) represents [[New York's 3rd congressional district]], which covers the northeast Queens neighborhoods of [[Little Neck, Queens|Little Neck]], [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], [[Glen Oaks, Queens|Glen Oaks]], and [[Floral Park, Queens|Floral Park]].

In 2004, Queens had 15.2% (440,310) of all private-sector jobs in New York City and 8.8% of private-sector wages. Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs, with occupations spread relatively evenly across the health care, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and [[film production|film]] and [[television production]] sectors, such that no single sector is overwhelmingly dominant.<ref name=\"state1\"/>\n\nThe diversification in Queens' economy is reflected in a large amount of employment in the [[export-oriented economy|export-oriented]] portions of its economy\u2014such as transportation, manufacturing, and business services\u2014that serve customers outside the region. This accounts for more than 27% of all Queens jobs and offers an average salary of $43,727, 14% greater than that of jobs in the locally oriented sector.\n\nThe borough's largest employment sector\u2014trade, transportation, and utilities\u2014accounted for nearly 30% of all jobs in 2004. Queens is home to two of the three major New York City area airports, [[JFK International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]]. These airports are among the busiest in the world, leading the airspace above Queens to be the most congested in the country. This airline industry is particularly important to the economy of Queens, providing almost one-quarter of the sector's employment and more than 30% of the sector's wages.\n\nEducation and health services are the next largest sector in Queens and comprised almost 24% of the borough's jobs in 2004. The manufacturing and construction industries in Queens are the largest of the City and account for nearly 17% of the borough's private sector jobs.

Nearly all roadways oriented north\u2013south are \"Streets\", while east\u2013west roadways are \"Avenues\", beginning with the number 1 in the west for Streets and the north for Avenues. In some parts of the borough, several consecutive streets may share numbers (for instance, 72nd Street followed by 72nd Place and 72nd Lane, or 52nd Avenue followed by 52nd Road, 52nd Drive, and 52nd Court), often confusing non-residents.<ref name=\"SARAH 2000\">{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Kershaw |title=Meet Me At 60th And 60th; Many Drivers Find Streets of Queens A Confusing Maze |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 15, 2000 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/nyregion/meet-me-at-60th-and-60th-many-drivers-find-streets-of-queens-a-confusing-maze.html | access-date=August 13, 2017}}</ref> Also, incongruous alignments of street grids, unusual street paths due to geography, or other circumstances often lead to the skipping of numbers (for instance, on Ditmars Boulevard, 70th Street is followed by Hazen Street which is followed by 49th Street). Numbered roads tend to be residential, although numbered commercial streets are not rare. A fair number of streets that were country roads in the 18th and 19th centuries (especially major thoroughfares such as [[New York State Route 25A|Northern Boulevard]], [[Queens Boulevard]], [[Hillside Avenue (Queens)|Hillside Avenue]], and [[Jamaica Avenue (Queens)|Jamaica Avenue]]) carry names rather than numbers, typically though not uniformly called \"Boulevards\" or \"Parkways\".\n\nQueens [[house numbering]] was designed to provide convenience in locating the address itself; the first half of a number in a Queens address refers to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or lot number from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th Street and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This pattern doesn't stop when a street is named, assuming that there is an existing numbered cross-street. For example, [[Queens College]] is situated at 65\u201330 Kissena Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance is 65th Avenue.<ref name=\"SARAH 2000\"/>\n\nMany of the village street grids of Queens had only worded names, some were numbered according to local numbering schemes, and some had a mix of words and numbers. In the early 1920s, a \"Philadelphia Plan\" was instituted to overlay one numbered system upon the whole borough. The Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens, worked out the details. Subway stations were only partly renamed, and some, including those along the [[IRT Flushing Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}), now share dual names after the original street names.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.junipercivic.com/historyArticle.asp?nid=74#.VHXch8m25KK |title=Bringing Order Out of Chaos in Street Naming and House Numbering |last=Powell |first=Charles U., Engineer in Charge, Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens |date=February 1928}}</ref> In 2012, some numbered streets in the [[Douglaston Hill Historic District]] were renamed to their original names, with 43rd Avenue becoming Pine Street.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/nyregion/in-douglaston-queens-turning-away-from-numbered-streets.html?src=recg |title=In Queens, Taking a Step Back From Numbered Streets |first=Sarah Maslin |last=Nir |date=March 26, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Rockaway Peninsula does not follow the same system as the rest of the borough and has its own numbering system. Streets are numbered in ascending order heading west from near the Nassau County border, and are prefixed with the word \"Beach.\" Streets at the easternmost end, however, are nearly all named. [[Bayswater, Queens|Bayswater]], which is on Jamaica Bay, has its numbered streets prefixed with the word \"Bay\" rather than \"Beach\". Another deviation from the norm is [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]]; it maintains the north\u2013south numbering progression but uses only the suffix \"Road,\" as well as the prefixes \"West\" and \"East,\" depending on location relative to [[Cross Bay Boulevard (Queens)|Cross Bay Boulevard]], the neighborhood's major through street. Broad Channel's streets were a continuation of the mainland Queens grid in the 1950s; formerly the highest-numbered avenue in Queens was 208th Avenue rather than today's 165th Avenue in Howard Beach & Hamilton Beach. The other exception is the neighborhood of Ridgewood, which for the most part shares a grid and [[house numbering]] system with the Brooklyn neighborhood of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]]. The grid runs east\u2013west from the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]] [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] to Flushing Avenue; and north\u2013south from Forest Avenue in Ridgewood to Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn before adjusting to meet up with the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] grid at Broadway. All streets on the grid have names.\n\n====Bridges and tunnels====\n{{see also|List of bridges and tunnels in New York City}}\n[[File:Hell Gate and Triborough Bridges New York City Queens.jpg|thumb|The [[Triborough Bridge]] connects Queens with Manhattan and the Bronx.]]\nQueens is connected to the Bronx by the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], the [[Triborough Bridge]] (also known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]]. Queens is connected to Manhattan Island by the Triborough Bridge, the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and the [[Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel]], as well as to [[Roosevelt Island]] by the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]].\n\nWhile most of the Queens/Brooklyn border is on land, the [[Kosciuszko Bridge]] crosses the [[Newtown Creek]] connecting [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]] to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. The [[Pulaski Bridge]] connects [[McGuinness Boulevard]] in Greenpoint to 11th Street, Jackson Avenue, and Hunters Point Avenue in [[Long Island City]]. The J. J. Byrne Memorial Bridge (a.k.a. [[Greenpoint Avenue Bridge]]) connects the sections of [[Greenpoint Avenue]] in Greenpoint and Long Island City. A lesser bridge connects [[Grand Street and Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue in Queens to Grand Street in Brooklyn]].\n\nThe [[Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge]], built in 1939, traverses Jamaica Bay to connect the Rockaway Peninsula to [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]] and the rest of Queens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/crossbay.html |title=Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge |website=[[MTA Bridges and Tunnels]] |access-date=July 5, 2016 |quote=In 1939 the New York City Parkway Authority built the Cross Bay Bridge and Parkway, along with beach improvements in the Rockaways.}}</ref> Constructed in 1937, the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] links [[Flatbush Avenue]], Brooklyn's longest thoroughfare, with [[Jacob Riis Park]] and the western end of the Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/marine.html |title=Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge |website=MTA Bridges and Tunnels |access-date=July 5, 2016 |quote=The Marine Parkway Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge was opened by the Marine Parkway Authority in 1937 to provide access to the Rockaway Peninsula, which previously could be reached only by ferry or by a circuitous route around the eastern end of Jamaica Bay.}}</ref> Both crossings were built and continue to be operated by what is now known as [[MTA Bridges and Tunnels]]. The [[IND Rockaway Line]] parallels the Cross Bay, has a mid-bay station at [[Broad Channel (IND Rockaway Line)|Broad Channel]] which is just a short walk from the [[Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge]], now part of [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] and a major stop on the [[Atlantic Flyway]].\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in New York City|List of high schools in New York City#Queens}}\n\n===Elementary and secondary education===\nElementary and secondary school education in Queens is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions.

{"title_page": "Australian railway signalling", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\n'''Australian railway signalling''' varies between the states of [[Australia]] as each railway was established under the different [[Colony|colonial]] [[Government|governments]] with separate legislation. As with the notorious situation of having different gauges, there are differing signal systems. [[New South Wales]] [[Railway signalling|signalling systems]] generally follow [[British Empire|British]] precepts, however American influence has increased somewhat since the 1990s. The [[Victorian Railways]] use [https://signalbox.org/overseas/australia/speed.htm ''Speed Signalling''.] This can cause confusion where the systems meet. For example, in [[New South Wales]], [[Green]]-over-Red means 'Caution', indicating the next signal is at 'Stop'. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] that same aspect, Green-over-Red, means 'Clear Normal Speed', indicating the next signal is anything but at 'Stop'. On the main south line from [[Sydney]], Single Light Colour Light signals are now exclusively used from Spring Creek bridge (south of [[Galong railway station|Galong]]) to [[Albury railway station|Albury]] on the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] border. This forms a buffer zone between the areas giving conflicting signal indications. Gradually the remaining [[Railway semaphore signal|Upper Quadrant signals]] (and Double Light Colour Light signals at Binalong) are being replaced by Single Light [[Colour]] Light signals.\n\n[[Rail transport in South Australia|South Australia]] uses two primary forms of signalling. Nearly all [[signal box]]es in [[South Australia]] have now been closed, and most rail traffic is coordinated through [[Centralized traffic control|centralised traffic control]] systems, either under [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] control from Mile End or [[Adelaide Metro]] control from [[Adelaide]].<ref>[[Adelaide|Adelaide as a tourist place]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}} Where these two networks interface, such as at the [[Goodwood railway station|Goodwood level crossing]] or at Torrens Junction, control is usually from [[Australian Rail Track Corporation|ARTC]] after release from Adelaide Metro. The [[Western Australian]] system is very simple to understand but the complexities of [[leading]] position lights and other odd [[wikt:attachment|attachment]]s to signalling [[wikt:apparatus|apparatus]] have been either eradicated or were never part of it. Switchlocks are used to exit mainline [[Centralized traffic control|CTC]] territory for sidings, such as CBH yard [[terminal]]s{{dn|date=April 2020}} on the Standard Gauge. The Train Controller must release the switchlock thus [[interlocking]] the signals to stop and this is similar to [[Queensland]]. [[Perth|Perth's]] urban passenger network is operated by the [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority]] and the Rules are identical to that of the [[Freight transport|freight]], with a few minor differences.\n\n== Overall Signalling Comparison ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table comparing the main aspects of each states system to show similar aspect

signal]]s in [[New South Wales]] broadly follow [[UK railway signalling|British route signaling]] practice, with certain [[United States|American]] influences and local innovations. The following systems are currently in use, listed in [[chronological]] order of introduction: two-position lower [[Railway semaphore signal|quadrant]] semaphore, three-position upper quadrant semaphore, Double Light Colour Light and Single Light Colour Light.\n\nDouble Light signals are capable of showing more indications than Single Light signals, therefore Double Light signals are more appropriate for use in dense traffic areas, such as the [[Sydney]] metropolitan area, and Single Light signals for the less intense areas. However combinations of the different types may be found at the same interlocking locations.\n\n===Systems of train signalling===\n[[New South Wales]] [[Railway signalling|signalling systems]] generally follow [[British Empire|British]] precepts, however '''[[United States|American]]''' influence has increased somewhat since the 1990s. Originally trains ran on the time-interval system and authority of the timetable. From the early 1870s, several near-misses and minor derailments led to serious discussion of improved safe-working arrangements and the implementation of interlocking. Despite this, very little action was taken until 1877, when a new rule book including the Staff & Ticket and Block [[Telegraphy|Telegraph systems]] was finally printed. The ink was barely dry on 30 January 1878 when two trains collided head-on at [[Emu Plains railway station|Emu Plains]], killing three. This put an end to timetable working on single lines. [[Absolute block signalling|Absolute Block Telegraph]] for double lines came in 1879, Saxby & Farmer's mechanical interlocking in 1881, [[Tyer's Electric Train Tablet|Tyer's Electric Tablet]] in 1888 (lasting until 1959) and the Electric Staff system in 1891. Tyer's One-Wire Block began to replace the original Preece's Patent instruments from 1891. Sykes' Lock & Block was used on a few suburban sections from 1900. Tyer's Three-Wire Block was used for permissive block working on the Up Relief line from [[Concord West railway station|Concord West]] to [[North Strathfield railway station|North Strathfield]] Junction from 1911 until 1983. In 1913, the two-wire New South Wales Standard Block, which was similar in principle to Lock & Block, became the standard for new installations. It was unique in having a fourth position, known as Train Arrived, and a different sequence of operation to standard British arrangements.<ref>Department of Railways, New South Wales: Regulations for [[Train]] Signalling by Block Telegraph on Double Lines, 1967</ref> The last of these instruments were removed from [[Exeter railway station, New South Wales|Exeter]], [[Bundanoon railway station|Bundanoon]] and [[Wingello railway station|Wingello]] on the [[Main Southern railway line|Main South line]] in 2007. By 1907, the majority of signalling equipment, including signals and mechanical lever frames, were being manufactured in-house under the direction of the English-born signal engineer, C.L.N.F. Wilkin. The NSWR Signal Engineer's Branch supplanted McKenzie & Holland as the principal supplier in most installations.\n\n===Power signalling===\n'''Power''' signalling arrived in 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of ([[Sydney]]) [[Station box|Station Box]]. This installation was [[electro-pneumatic]] and controlled from a miniature lever frame supplied by the McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of [[Worcester]], [[England]]. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some control of signals by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 lever pistol grip power frame in the new Sydney Station West [[signalbox]] in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused '[[Station box|Station Box]]' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.\n\n====Track Circuit Block====\nOn 22 June 1913 the first automatic signals in [[Australia]] were brought into use between [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]] Loco Junction ([[Illawarra Junction]]) and [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham]], replacing Tyer's One-Wire Block. These signals were of the two-arm home and distant type. From that time on, a form of Track Circuit Block (TCB) worked from mechanical and power signalboxes, with the gradual spread of automatic signalling between stations, became the standard for new installations, initially with semaphore but later colour light signals. In practice, the term Track Circuit Block was generally shortened to 'Track Block', of which there were a number of (mainly administrative) variations in the rules, such as Double Line Track Block and Single Line Track Block. Track Circuit Block, now known officially as the Rail Vehicle Detection system,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rail Infrastructure Corporation (now RailCorp) Network Rules, 2002</ref> remains the standard system of train signalling on all main lines in the [[RailCorp]] network.\n\n====Absolute-Permissive Block====\nThe American Absolute-Permissive Block system, known locally as Single Line Automatic, was installed on the [[Molong-Dubbo railway line|Molong to Dubbo line]] by C.B. Byles in 1925. Train movements on the line were regulated by a Train Controller at [[Yeoval, New South Wales|Yeoval]], who directed the issue of crossing orders for trains on the line. While a technical success, the traffic density did not warrant the cost of maintaining the signalling system. It was replaced by the first installation of the Divisible Miniature Electric Staff system in 1933.{{sfn|Dargan|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n====Signalboxes in 2012====\n[[Signalling control|Signalboxes]] remain scattered throughout the [[Sydney Trains]] network, with thirty-six still in regular use in 2012, including nine controlled by local station staff, twenty-six by dedicated Signallers and one shared by both. The majority of these were commissioned before 1970, a few of which have been in continuous use since the late nineteenth century, albeit surviving in a modified state. Eleven are still fitted with Byles-type mechanical lever frames and five have early relay interlocking with Individual Function Switch (IFS) or similar [[electric switch]] panels. Newcastle Signalbox, commissioned in 1936 by W.F. Barton, has the last [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] miniature lever power frame in Australia, and one of few remaining in the world. Sixteen signalboxes are fitted with route control relay/solid state interlocking systems and hardwired panels, and three are equipped solely with computerised, VDU-based route control. A few other signalling installations exist outside the RailCorp network, under the control of other rail operators. [[Junee railway station|Junee]] and [[Broadmeadow railway station|Broadmeadow]] are home to integrated electronic control centres, both of which are run by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]], custodian of the busiest lines in the country network of the state.\n\n===Three-position lower quadrant semaphore===\nStandard British three position lower quadrant [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphore signals]], with an arm for each direction and spectacles mounted below them, were used from the introduction of time-interval working in 1855. The last signal of this type was removed from [[Girilambone]] in 1952. The Danger signal was given by a horizontal arm and red light during darkness. The arm was lowered 45 degrees, with a green light for Caution, to \"slacken speed\", and to an almost vertical position in a slotted post with a white light for All Right.<ref>Sydney Railway Rules and Regulations, 1855</ref>\n\n===Two-position lower quadrant semaphore===\n[[File:Signal Distant NSW.svg|thumb|The distant signal in NSW has a fixed upper green light]]\nLower Quadrant [[Railway semaphore signal|Semaphore]] signals use an arm that works in a horizontal position and may be lowered to a 45-degree angle, they can only give two indications. In the horizontal position a red light is displayed, in the lowered position a green light is displayed. There are two types of arms. A Distant signal uses a fishtail arm, Home and Starting signals use a square-tail arm.\n\nSemaphore distant signals in [[New South Wales]] are fitted with a fixed green light, positioned above the arm and spectacle, so that they may be easily distinguished from stop signals at night. Although yellow lights were trialled, neither they, nor yellow and black arms were adopted, meaning that distant signal arms are still painted red and white.\n\nIf the Home or Starting signal is at Danger, the Distant signal will be at Caution, its arm in the horizontal position with a green light over a red light exhibited at night. If the Home and Starting signals are Clear, the Distant will be Clear, its arm lowered, with two green lights exhibited at night.\n\nThe term \"Stop\" gradually replaced \"Danger\" for the purpose of identifying the normal position of stop signals in official publications from circa 1927, with both terms mentioned in the rule book issued in that year.<ref>New South Wales Government Railways Rules and Regulations, 1927</ref>\n\n====Combined home and distant signals====\nWhere [[interlocking]]s are closely placed, a Starting signal arm may be fitted above a Distant signal arm. In this case the Starting arm can be placed at Stop and display a red light. As the lower Distant signal arm cannot be cleared while the upper arm is at Stop the signal will show two red lights. The basis for Double Light signalling was thus established by a sequence of Distant and two-arm signals, so that it was then possible to encounter a signal showing two green lights (Clear), followed by a green light over a red light (Caution) then one or two red lights (Stop).\n\n===Upper quadrant semaphore signals===\n[[File:NSW UQ Rail Signals.jpg|thumb|UQ semaphore signals, 3 position auto (right) and 2 position distant (left)]]\nThe power-operated three-position upper quadrant semaphore signal, American in origin, was introduced to [[New South Wales]] by the English signal engineer, C.B. Byles, in 1913. Byles (1871\u20131948) led [[New South Wales Government Railways|New South Wales Railways]] through its introduction of power signalling, from 1911 until 1929.{{sfn|Dargan|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2019}} At night, two lights, one above the other, are exhibited. The spectacle attached to the signal arm has three lenses, that is a green for the vertical clear position and red for the other two lenses. In some cases the semaphore arm moves to the horizontal danger position when the line between the distant signal and the stop signal to which it applies is occupied. The Distant signals capable of exhibiting Danger are fitted with an upper red/green spectacle; the two-position versions have a fixed upper green. The Home/Starting signals give three indications. The arm moves from horizontal displaying a red light, upwards to 45 degrees displaying a green or yellow light, and fully vertical also displaying a green light. In double light areas, the lower light of these signals stays red until a full Clear indication is shown. Therefore, these signals will show the same lights indicated by the [[google:lower+quadrant+semaphore+meaning&rlz=1C1GCEB_enAU891&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8xLncv_3nAhWmxzgGHWBUBrcQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=AYria8k4DVsmgM|Lower Quadrant Semaphore]] Distant and two-arm signals, that is, two greens for Clear, a green over a red for Caution and two reds for Stop.\n\n===Double light colour light===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Sydney_Double_Colour_Signalling_Clear_Aspect.png|alt=|frameless|76x76px]]\n|Green / Green\n|Clear\n|Proceed, expect the next signal to be at Clear\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Preliminary Medium Sydney GIF.gif|frameless|91x91px]]\n|Green / Blinking Yellow\n|Advanced Preliminary Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop after 2 more warning signals\n|Not always provided\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Medium Sydney Trains.png|frameless|84x84px]]\n|Green / Yellow\n|Preliminary Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|Not always provided, but extremely common\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Sydney Trains.png|frameless|85x85px]]\n|Green / Red\n|Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Stop Sydney Trains.png|frameless|83x83px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Shunt Signal Sydney.png|frameless|79x79px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Shunt\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

This system was introduced in 1924 by C.B. Byles. Most of the [[Sydney]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] metropolitan areas are equipped with Double Light Colour Light signals, in accordance with principles established during the tenure of Byles, although some of the signals in the outer suburbs has been replaced with Single Light Colour Light. Both systems have almost the same capabilities, with Double Light Colour Light only having a small advantage in aspect variety.\n\nA basic double light colour light signal consists of two multiple lamp colour light signal heads, one above the other. In case of automatic signals, the upper and lower lights are vertically offset from each other or \"staggered\". Alternatively, the lower light may be directly below the upper light, like a controlled or semi-automatic signal. An 'A' plate is then fixed to the signal post or the tunnel wall adjacent to the signal to identify it as automatic. The term \"semi-automatic\" is no longer mentioned in official publications, although the signals still exist. They are classified according to their instantaneous mode of operation rather than capability, i.e. \"controlled\" or \"automatic\". Automatic signals in tunnels were originally identified by a white marker light, since the lights could not be staggered, but 'A' plates are now used. More commonly used in the [[City Circle]] is a blue 'A' light, which can, when required, extinguish and work as a controlled signal.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/31766/NSG-600-Running-signals.PDF| website=RailSafe| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830142318/https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/31766/NSG-600-Running-signals.PDF| archivedate=30 August 2018| title=NSG 600: Running signals| date=April 2017| author=Sydney Trains}}</ref>\n\nThe simplest and original form of double light colour light signal provides three indications, that is Clear (green over green), Caution (green over red) and Stop (red over red). A fourth indication, known as Medium, is indicated by green over yellow. This equates to the \"double yellow\" in British multiple aspect signalling. The Medium indication was introduced in June 1926, three months after the first double yellow indication was used in the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/31763/NSG-606-Responding-to-signals-and-signs.PDF| website=RailSafe| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830174307/https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/31763/NSG-606-Responding-to-signals-and-signs.PDF| archivedate=30 August 2018| title=NSG 606: Responding to signals and signs| date=April 2017| author=Sydney Trains}}</ref>\n\nFacing junction signals may exhibit an upper yellow light where a diverging route is set. The yellow light was originally said to mean \"attention - proceed at medium speed\" in accordance with a 1924 study by the Institute of Railway Signal Engineers in which Byles participated.<ref>{{cite book| last=Byles| first=C.B.| title=The Electrification of Sydney and Suburban Railways, II - The Signalling System| publisher=Institution of Engineers, Australia| year=1926}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2019}} However, \"medium speed\" was never properly defined and the term has now been removed from the official rule book. The exhibition of an upper yellow light does not impose a specific speed restriction for approaching trains; it is still the responsibility of the driver to be familiar with the route and observe lineside speed boards relating to points and crossings. The turnout indications are as follows: Caution Turnout (yellow over red), meaning proceed on diverging route, prepared to stop at the next signal (originally known as Medium Caution), and Medium Turnout (yellow over yellow), meaning proceed on diverging route, the next signal is exhibiting a proceed indication. Oddly, these indications can also be seen at some trailing junctions, at which only one converging route option is available. Whilst the upper yellow light implies that a reduction in speed may be necessary, this is not consistent with conventional route signalling practice. Turnout and junction signals are the most inconsistent and diverse in the NSW signalling system.\n\n==== Reduced-overlap working and speed control ====\n[[File:Sydney_Trains_Trip_Dropping_Example.gif|alt=|thumb|616x616px|Original 1932 operation of Sydney's Speed Controlled Trips. Note: The Signal that allows the trains to proceed into the platform is a \"Close Up\" signal and conflicting sources say that the small lower light was either White, Yellow or Green.]]\nProjected traffic density warranted the introduction of additional signal indications. One of these was a small green light under the two main red lights of a Stop signal, indicating Low Speed. The Low Speed indication was provided in the [[City Circle|Underground City Railway]] from its opening on 28 February 1932. The standard speed restriction imposed by train stops with the Low Speed indication was originally 17&nbsp;mph. However, at some locations, the maximum permissible speed is as low as 5&nbsp;mph, subject to local conditions. \n\nUp until the City Circle Resignalling of the 1990s, the western stations of the line were able to allow a following train into the platform on a Close Up / Low Speed Signal (Red on Red on a small light) and used the trips spread along the platform to ensure that the arriving train would not get too close to the train still departing. This allowed these stations to deal with 42 trains per hour in either direction provided sub 40 second dwell times. The 1990s resignalling changed the older eastern stations to follow a similar operation, only these days the system will not let a following train in until the previous train has departed completely.\n\nIn the Underground City and [[Eastern Suburbs railway line]]s, a speed restriction of 30&nbsp;mph also applies to the Caution indication. The train stops can be seen dropping as the signals step-up to Medium. Closely spaced 'multi home signals', similar to those used on the [[London Underground]], are also a feature of the Underground City and Eastern Suburbs lines. Speed control by intermediate train stops, based on Byles' system, was introduced on the London Underground following the accident at [[Moorgate]] on 28 February 1975, in which 43 people were killed. These are spread out along the platform at major stations, mostly on the City Circle. When the signal at the end of platform is at stop, they will only drop when the train reaches a predetermined speed, which is lower as the train gets closer to the end of the platform. The last trip will only drop when the train is at around 5&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe sequence of aspects on the approach to a preceding train in areas where the Low Speed indication is in use is as follows: Clear, Medium, Caution, Low Speed, Stop. In rare cases, the Medium indication will be exhibited at two consecutive signals. At some locations, the Low Speed indication will only be exhibited under reduced overlap conditions (e.g. owing to the presence of a train ahead). Under such a configuration, the sequence of aspects will be: Clear, Medium, Caution, Stop, provided the full overlap is available.\n\nAn additional subsidiary indication below a stop signal is the Close Up. This appears similar to the Low Speed indication, except that the subsidiary green light is provided in a separate lamp case below a plate labelled \"CLOSE UP\".<ref>Department of Railways, New South Wales: General Appendix to the Book of Rules and Regulations and to the Working Time-Tables, Part II, 1967</ref> Speed control does not apply to the Close Up indication, which is manually selected by the Signaller in most cases and indicates that the section is clear but the station or junction ahead is blocked. Close Up signals are equivalent to the British warning (\"W\") signal for restricted acceptance. Signals fitted with a Close Up lamp case are increasingly rare.\n\n====Preliminary medium indications and turnout repeaters====\n{{underlinked|section|date=September 2017}}\nA fifth main aspect, Preliminary Medium, is available, with a pulsating yellow light beneath an upper green.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> It is often used before a Medium indication to provide additional notice of the need to reduce speed for a facing junction. The typical sequence of aspects on the approach to a junction where Preliminary Medium is in use is as follows: Clear, Preliminary Medium (with or without directional indicator), Medium, Medium Turnout or Caution Turnout at the junction signal. At some locations, Preliminary Medium may be exhibited at two consecutive signals. Many automatic signals that are not near junctions can also display the Preliminary Medium indication to give additional warning to freight trains about upcoming red signals.\n\nDirectional indicators have been introduced to resolve the [[ambiguity]] that may arise when a medium aspect (green over yellow) can precede either a caution aspect (green over red) or one of the turnout aspects (yellow over red/yellow). The indicator is provided at the signal(s) in rear of a junction signal. When illuminated it displays a white bar, inclined at 45 degrees to the left or right, placed above the main signal heads. The bar is not lit when the next signal applies to the straight route, but is illuminated when the next signal applies to the turnout. The white indicator is proved to be alight before the yellow is displayed.\n\nAt high speed junctions, turnout indications are no longer provided. Instead, the signal in rear of the junction signal is provided with a directional indicator. The junction signal is provided with a route indicator, and exhibits the least-restrictive straight route indication permitted by track circuit occupancy.\n\n=====Double light colour light repeaters=====\nRepeaters in the form of Double Light Colour Light signals are provided at some locations in the metropolitan area. These \"repeaters\" are unusual in that they do not replicate the indication of the stop signals to which they apply. Instead, they are wired like separate block signals or Distant signals. For instance, the repeater will be at green over red when the signal to which it applies is at Stop. The red over red indication will only be exhibited when the line between the repeater and the stop signal is occupied, and is treated as a Permissive Stop.\n\n===Single light colour light===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:NSWR Green.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Green\n|Clear\n|Proceed, expect the next signal to be at Clear\n|\n|-\n|-\n|[[File:Pulsing Yellow SLCL.gif|frameless|85x85px]]\n|Blinking Yellow\n|Preliminary Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|Not always provided\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Steady Yellow NSW.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Yellow\n|Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Red Signal NSW.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:SCSS NSW Shunt.png|frameless|87x87px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Shunt\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

Vernon, Signal Engineer. This system is derived directly from British multiple-aspect signalling, with American influence in the form of a marker light. Using a single green light for Clear and a single yellow light for Caution, these signals exhibit a single red light with a smaller lower red \"marker\" light for Stop. Turnout indications can be provided with three yellow lights at an angle of 45 degrees under a red light in the main signal head. The fourth indication, Medium, which equates to the British Preliminary Caution, is a flashing or pulsating yellow light.\n\nOriginally, a permanently illuminated white marker light was positioned beneath the main colour light head in lieu of the red marker light. The caution turnout indication was a single yellow in the main head over three white lights at an angle of 45 degrees.<ref>State Rail Authority of New South Wales: Basic Safeworking Manual; Safeworking Signalling Manual, 1993</ref> The red marker light was introduced from 1965. The majority of early single light colour light signals had either been replaced or retrofitted with red marker lights, by 2000.\n\nSome Upper Quadrant Semaphore signals were adapted as Single Light Colour Light signals giving the same colour indications while retaining the arm. The sequence of indications of Single Light Colour Light signals is one green light for Clear, one yellow light for Caution, one red light with a lower smaller red light for Stop. The last Upper Quadrant Semaphore Single Light signal was on the Up South Main Line at [[Moss Vale railway station|Moss Vale]], which was replaced in 2007 when Moss Vale and Moss Vale Junction were resignalled, resulting in the closure of local signal boxes at those locations.\n\n=== NSW Dwarf Signals ===\nThese signals are in use within SLCL and DLCL Territory.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Sydney Shunt Red.png|frameless|85x85px]]\n|2 Red Lights\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Sydney Shunt Proceed.png|frameless|78x78px]]\n|Yellow Light\n|Caution Proceed\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until you pass the next signal.

However, much of the Queensland rail network is still controlled by legacy signalling systems such as Staff and Ticket.\n\nThe system contains the main four aspects from British Rail signalling; Clear, Preliminary Caution, Caution and Danger. It also uses White lights to display Shunt Signals. The variance in QLD's system is with the Special Caution indication. This means the same thing as Caution just with an additional 40&nbsp;km/h speed restriction. The signal is used when the overlap passed the next red signal is occupied by either a train, or a conflicting junction. It means almost the same thing as \"Low Speed\" in Sydney's signalling system, there are just no speed proving systems and the speed limit is 40, not 25 km/h.\n\nQLD makes use of Junction indicators at the signals protecting junctions. These are a separate display of white lights above the main signal head that are angled in the direction of the turnout; they can also be of a theatre display type which shows a letter or multiple letters which refer to the location that the train is being directed to.\n\nIn order to provide warning of upcoming turnouts, QLD makes use of Dynamic Speed Indicators, these are boxes below the main set of lights which contain yellow text. The text will tell the driver what speed they are allow to pass the next signal, the presence of the text will warn them of an upcoming turnout. The usual speeds that can be displayed are: 25, 40, 50 and 80.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenslandscalemodels.com.au/Qld%20Colour%20Light%20Signalling.doc.pdf|title=Queensland Colour Light Signalling|last=Driver|first=Lincoln|date=|website=queenslandscalemodels.com.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== QLD Dwarf Signals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Brisbane Shunt Signal.png|frameless|94x94px]]\n|Red and White Lights\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Brisbane Shunt Proceed.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|2 White Lights spaced diagonally\n|Proceed \n(Restricted)\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

Nearly all [[signal box]]es in South Australia have now been closed, with most rail traffic being coordinated through [[Centralized traffic control|centralised traffic control]] systems, either under [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] control from Mile End or [[Adelaide Metro]] control from Adelaide. Where these two networks interface, such as at the [[Goodwood railway station|Goodwood level crossing]] or at Torrens Junction, control is usually from ARTC after release from Adelaide Metro. Despite the almost uniform CTC control some signal boxes still exist, such as Dry Creek South although they are not normally switched in.\n\n===Speed signalling===\n{{underlinked|section|date=September 2017}}\nBefore 1988, signalling in the metropolitan area was three-position speed signalling, similar to the Victorian system. All mainline signals have two signal 'heads' (originally upper quadrant semaphore arms but now colour light, LED or searchlight), both are always lit. The aspects shown depend on the allowable speed for the route set. If the route was for Normal speed, the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the top head, if the move is for Medium speed (35&nbsp;km/h, such as when entering a loop or siding), the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the lower head. The colours displayed by either depended on how many blocks ahead were clear; green if two or more blocks were clear and yellow if only one was clear (i.e. the next signal showed Stop).\n\nHence the aspects (and indications) are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:SA Red.png|frameless|79x79px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:SA green.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Green / Red\n|Clear Normal Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed.\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:SA Amber signal.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Yellow / Red\n|Normal Speed Warning\n|Proceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:SA RTMS.png|frameless|87x87px]]\n|Yellow / Green\n|Reduce to Medium Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed (35 km/h) before the next signal\n|Used before \"Medium speed\" signals\n|None, but prepare to reduce to 35&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Red on Green SA.png|frameless|84x84px]]\n|Red / Green\n|Clear Medium Speed\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 35 km/h)\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|35&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Red on Yellow SA.png|frameless|85x85px]]\n|Red / Yellow\n|Medium Speed Warning\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 35 km/h), but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|35&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Shunt SA.png|frameless|86x86px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Shunt\n|Proceed past signal on sight, expecting to stop short of possible obstruction.\n|Used for shunting movements\n|15&nbsp;km/h\n|}\n'Reduce to Medium speed' (35&nbsp;km/h) is used when the next signal displays one of the Medium speed indications. If the top light (normal speed) only displays red (such as departing from a crossing loop), it is only fitted with a red aspect. If the lower light (medium speed) only displays red, it is often replaced with a red reflector in place of a red light.\n\nMany signals on the ARTC controlled network are \"approach lit\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sa-trackandsignal.net/Pdf%20files/ARTC/ARS-Sig%20symb.pdf| title=Signal Symbols used on drawings of ARTC lines in South Australia| website=SA Track and Signal}}</ref> meaning that they are normally extinguished, but a train on the track circuit(s) in advance of the signal will cause it to illuminate. This is both to save power at remote locations without mains power supply, and an effort to reduce vandalism.\n\n====Dwarf signals====\nDwarf signals can be used to show Low speed aspects at signals where main line aspects are not needed. These were originally upper quadrant disc signals but are now all of the colour light or searchlight variety.

Absolute signals cannot be passed at Stop without permission from the signaller or controller, whereas Permissive signals at Stop can be passed after having stopped for a one-minute waiting period. Absolute signals can be identified by the fact that the two lights are vertically aligned, whereas with Permissive signals they are vertically off-set (staggered on different sides of the post). Dwarf signals are always Absolute.\n\n===Suburban network===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Proceed QLD.png|frameless|83x83px]]\n|Green\n|Clear\n|Proceed, expect the next signal to be at Proceed\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Brissy.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Yellow\n|Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Adelaide Red Signal.png|frameless|83x83px]]\n|Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Adelaide Flashing Yellow.gif|frameless|95x95px]]\n|Blinking Yellow\n|Reduce to Medium Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed before the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Adelaide Suburban Shunt Signal.png|frameless|77x77px]]\n|Red / Two Diagonal White lights\n|Proceed at low Speed\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past next signal.

Be prepared to stop at obstruction.\n|Non-mainline movements\n|15&nbsp;km/h\n|}\nIn 1988 the [[Adelaide Metro]] lines were resignalled with the opening of the Adelaide control centre. The system is quite similar to modern UK colour light signalling, being a route signalling system, though it lacks the double yellow aspect and makes use of 'permissive' signals. There are three basic aspects: red for stop, yellow for caution and green for clear. A reduce to medium speed aspect is also used to give early warning of a divergence, and is given by a flashing yellow light. All aspects are indicated with colour light signals. Despite this re-signalling, some parts of the TransAdelaide network still use the original 3-position speed signalling (such as the Dry Creek to Port Adelaide line).\n\nThere is also a low speed aspect indicated by a lunar-white position-light signal mounted below the main head. It shows two lunar-white lights at 45 degrees (to mimic an upper-quadrant semaphore) to indicate proceed at low speed. These position light signals are also used for dwarf signals and in this case they can also display 'stop' as a red light and lunar-white light in a horizontal row.\n\nJunctions on running signals are indicated by a row of five lunar-white lights angled in the direction of divergence. If multiple routes are to be signalled, several rows may be used.\n\nPermissive signals are indicated by a circular 'P' plate offset below the signal head and Absolute by a square 'A' plate directly below the signal head. As with three-position signalling, dwarf (low speed) signals are always absolute. An 'A' plate in New South Wales or Victoria means the signal is automatic and therefore a Permissive signal, which is again a source of conflicting meaning between the differing signalling systems.\n\nIn the Adelaide station yard Theatre-style route indicators are used on both running signals and shunt signals; platform numbers for 'up' trains and route through the yard for 'down' trains. The down indicators have changed over time. At present, the indicators for Down Trains show the following indications:\n* SM-Seaford Main (Previously SS-South Suburban Line), \n* BM-Belair Main (Previously SM-South Main Line), \n* PM-Port Main Line, \n* NM-North Main Line, \n* RD-Railcar Depot (No longer used), \n* SY-Stabling Siding (No longer used), \n* NY-North Yard.\n\n== Tasmania ==\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\nThe railways of Tasmania predominantly follow the [[UK railway signalling|United Kingdom railway signalling system]]. Routes use [[Lineside signal|lineside signals]] to control the passage of trains within the [[Rail transport in Tasmania|Tasmanian rail network]].\n\n== Victoria ==\n[[File:Mechanical-signalling-north-geelong.jpg|thumb|Mechanical ''2 position'' semaphore signalling at [[North Geelong railway station|North Geelong]]]]\n[[File:Mechanical-interlocking-frame-avenel.jpg|thumb|Mechanical [[interlocking]] frame for signal control at [[Avenel railway station, Victoria|Avenel]]]]\n[[File:Led-colour-light-signal.jpg|thumb|Modern LED colour light ''3 position'' signalling]]\n\n{{see also|Rail transport in Victoria}}<!-- update there first please, then here too -->The [[Rail transport in Victoria|railways of Victoria]] use a mix of [[railway signalling]] practices: British route signalling with home and distant signals (''2 position signalling'') and American speed signalling (''3 position signalling'').{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=x}}\n\n2 Position Signalling is still in use today despite its redundancy. Each signal is either a \"Home\" or a \"Distant\" Signal, where Home Signals can display a Red aspect that tell a driver they must stop, and Distant Signals display a \"Yellow\" aspect that warns the driver that the next home signal is displaying a Red aspect. All signals can display a green aspect that means \"Clear\".\n\nJunction direction indications are given by displaying two aspects side by side on the same signal mast. Only the signal to the same side as the selected route will display the relevant aspect, while the other will be Red.\n\n===== Example of a Signalling Layout of Two Aspect Signalling. =====\nNote that every second signal is a Distant Signal.\n[[File:Melbourne 2 Aspect Signalling Diagram.png|center|frameless|658x658px|Approximately every second signal is a Distant Signal.

Normally two or more signal heads are placed on the same mast (this can often mean one is placed above the other; in which case the upper signal refers to the leftmost route, and the lower to the right most route) and the route they correspond to is designated by the signalling diagrams of the track section. Only one of these signal heads can be given any indication (other than red) at a time.\n[[File:Diverge Right VIC.png|thumb|174x174px|An example of a Diverge Right Signal from Victoria]]\n\nTwo aspect signalling also makes use of the \"Warning\" and \"Proceed\" repeaters mentioned in the Three aspect section, but normally these signals will be used on the boarder between the two sections, to give drivers additional warning when they are entering 3 aspect territory. The use of these signals today is assumed to be extremely limited, as there is very little evidence of their existence anywhere in the network; despite their continued existence in the rulebook.\n\n=== Two Aspect Dwarf Signals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Dwarf 2 Aspect Red.png|frameless|76x76px]]\n|Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:2 Aspect Dwarf Green.png|frameless]]\n|Green\n|Proceed \n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until you pass the next signal.

With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with [[Staff and Ticket]] working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines.{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=64}} Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with ''Winters Block'' working between 1883 and 1888,{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=66}} a system that is a predecessor of the ''Double Line Block'' system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the ''Staff and Ticket'' system, with busier lines provided with [[Electric Staff]] working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.\n\nHeavier suburban traffic on the [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne network]] saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required a large number of manned signalboxes to enable trains to run close together.<ref name=\"elect20\">{{cite book|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|last1=Dornan|first1=S.E.|last2=Henderson|first2=R.G.|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|year=1979|isbn=0-909459-06-1|page=20}}</ref> As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the [[Automatic Block Signal|Automatic Block System]] (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers.{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=x}} These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=89}}\n\n=== Victorian Three Aspect Signalling ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Red Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Green Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Green / Red\n|Clear Normal Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed.\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Yellow Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|93x93px]]\n|Yellow / Red\n|Normal Speed Warning\n|Proceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne RMS Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|80x80px]]\n|Yellow / Green\n|Reduce to Medium Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed (40 km/h) before the next signal\n|Used before \"Medium speed\" signals\n|None, but reduce to 40&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Medium Clear Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Red / Green\n|Clear Medium Speed\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 40 km/h)\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|40&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Medium Caution Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Red / Yellow\n|Medium Speed Warning\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 40 km/h), but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|40&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Shunt.png|frameless|92x92px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Low Speed Caution\n|Proceed at no more than 15 km/h, the track section may be occupied and you must stop short of any obstruction\n|Used for shunting movements\n|15&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Warning.png|frameless|87x87px]]\n|Yellow / Yellow\n|Warning\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Extremely Rare\n\n\nUsed most often on the boarders between two aspect territory.\n|40 if preceded by \"Medium Speed\" signal.\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Proceed.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Green / Yellow\n|Clear\n|Proceed, the next signal is at Normal Speed\n|Extremely Rare\n\n\nUsed most often on the boarders between two aspect territory.\n| -\n|}<br />\n\n=== Victorian Three Aspect Dwarf Signals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:SA Dwarf Purple.png|frameless|94x94px]]\n|Red or Purple Light\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:SA Proceed Caution.png|frameless|96x96px]]\n|Yellow Light\n|Low Speed Caution\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

[[Leonora, Western Australia|Leonora]] and [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] were also \"widened\" to standard gauge at this time because they were connected through Coolgardie and that railway was decommissioned once the Standard Gauge project was completed.\n\nStaff and Ticket were the primary form of signalling safe working system used in Western Australia apart from major yards and main lines such as the Eastern Goldfields Railway. This has been replaced with Train Orders and no staff and ticket exists in Western Australian and hasn't for more than 20 years.\n\nIn 1967, the standard gauge was completed between Kalgoorlie and [[Kwinana railway station|Kwinana]], with a dual gauge section built in the [[Avon Valley Railway|Avon Valley]] between [[Avon Yard]] and Kwinana. From Avon Yard to Kalgoorlie this is known as the Single Line Automatic Signalling System using absolute block. Absolute block is used all throughout Western Australia with exception to the Pilbara Railways as no information has been attained to cover that area.\n\nA three aspect colour light signal is used in the Western Australian standard gauge railway and this system is almost completely uniform through the network in automatic signalling territory (narrow gauge as well). When a crossing loop is reached, a [[Home signal|Home Signal]] will have a signal for each, with the crossing segment signal being 45 degrees beneath the main line signal and in the direction of the turnout. For example, if the turnout was a right-hand the crossing signal would be on the right side below the main signal. Either signal is taken as the Home signal even if taking the loop. Each has an individual number and letter.\n\nAll branch lines in Western Australia use Train Orders, formerly staff and ticket. Train Orders does utilise a signal at the entrance and the exit of the territory.\n\nThe Western Australian system is very simple to understand but the complexities of leading position lights and other odd attachments to signalling apparatus have been either eradicated or were never part of it. Switchlocks are used to exit mainline CTC territory for sidings, such as CBH yard terminals on the Standard Gauge. The Train Controller must release the switchlock thus interlocking the signals to stop and this is similar to Queensland.\n\nPoints on mainlines in Western Australia are not equipped with leading position light signalling. In fact there is no need for this type of signals as it is just an added cost. This saves money on equipment and also improves the driver's workload by only having to pay attention to critical information during critical phases of approaching signals.\n\nThere are simple yellow light shunt signals on signal posts which authorise movements to the next obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow speed shunt signal indication and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see [[Hines Hill train collision]]) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow speed shunt signal, not meant for mainline operations.\n\nThere are no speed signals in Western Australia's freight system operated by Brookfield Rail<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brookfieldrail.com/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213123431/http://www.brookfieldrail.com/| archivedate=13 February 2017| website=Brookfield Rail| title=(home)}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2019}}</ref> <!-- (unsure about Pilbara) --> and they are either Approach, Outer Home, Home, Departure and Starting signals.<ref name=\"austlii.edu.au\">{{cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/repealed_reg/grab1994379/sch1.html| title=Government Railways Amendment By-Laws 1994 - Schedule| website=AustLII: Western Australian Repealed Regulations}}</ref>\nPerth's urban passenger network is operated by the [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority]] and the Rules are identical to that of the freight, with a few minor differences. One of them is the use of Station Limits boards similar to that used in Train Order territory.\n\n== Contradictory meanings ==\nSignalling systems vary between the states of Australia as each railway was established under the different colonial governments with separate legislation. As with the notorious situation of having different gauges, there are differing signal systems. The [[Victorian Railways]] use Speed Signalling. This has led to similar signal indications giving very different meanings in these two states. For example, in New South Wales Green-over-Red means 'Caution', indicating the next signal is at 'Stop'. In Victoria that same aspect, Green-over-Red, means 'Clear Normal Speed', indicating the next signal is anything but at 'Stop'.\n\nOn the main south line from [[Sydney]], Single Light Colour Light signals are now exclusively used from Spring Creek bridge (south of [[Galong railway station|Galong]]) to [[Albury railway station|Albury]] on the Victorian border. This forms a buffer zone between the areas giving conflicting signal indications. Gradually the remaining Upper Quadrant signals (and Double Light Colour Light signals at Binalong) are being replaced by Single Light Colour Light signals.\n\n=== Table of Contradictory Meanings throughout Australian Railway Networks. ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Aspect\n!Meaning in State 1\n!Meaning in State 2\n!Meaning in State 3\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Sydney Trains.png|frameless|88x88px]] [[File:Melbourne Green Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|82x82px]][[File:SA green.png|frameless|91x91px]] Green / Red\n|NSW\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Victoria\n\nProceed at normal speed\n|SA\n\nProceed at normal speed\n\n|-\n|[[File:Medium Sydney Trains.png|frameless|85x85px]][[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Proceed.png|frameless|88x88px]] Green / Yellow\n|NSW\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|Victoria,\n\nProceed, the next signal is at Normal Speed\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Turnout.png|frameless|93x93px]][[File:Melbourne Yellow Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|93x93px]][[File:SA Amber signal.png|frameless|92x92px]] Yellow / Red\n|NSW\n\nProceed over the turnout, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n\n|Victoria\n\nProceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|SA\n\nProceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|-\n|[[File:Medium Turnout.png|frameless|87x87px]][[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Warning.png|frameless|87x87px]] [[File:Preliminary Caution Brisbane.png|frameless|90x90px]]Yellow / Yellow\n|NSW\n\nProceed over the turnout, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n\n|Victoria,\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|QLD\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|-\n|[[File:Pulsing Yellow SLCL.gif|frameless|85x85px]][[File:Adelaide Flashing Yellow.gif|frameless|96x96px]][[File:Brisbane Flashing Yellow.gif|frameless|91x91px]]Blinking Yellow\n|NSW Single Colour Light\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n<br />\n|Adelaide Suburban Network\n\nProceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed (35 km/h) before the next signal\n|QLD\n\nProceed at no more than 25 km/h and be ready to stop at the next signal\n\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Medium Caution Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|88x88px]][[File:Perth Shunt.png|frameless|81x81px]][[File:Red on Yellow SA.png|frameless|85x85px]] Red / Yellow\n|Victoria\n\nProceed at medium speed (No more than 40 km/h), but be ready to stop at the next signal\n\n|Perth Suburban Network\n\nShunt.

signal]]s in [[New South Wales]] broadly follow [[UK railway signalling|British route signaling]] practice, with certain [[United States|American]] influences and local innovations. The following systems are currently in use, listed in [[chronological]] order of introduction: two-position lower [[Railway semaphore signal|quadrant]] semaphore, three-position upper quadrant semaphore, Double Light Colour Light and Single Light Colour Light.\n\nDouble Light signals are capable of showing more indications than Single Light signals, therefore Double Light signals are more appropriate for use in dense traffic areas, such as the [[Sydney]] metropolitan area, and Single Light signals for the less intense areas. However combinations of the different types may be found at the same interlocking locations.\n\n===Systems of train signalling===\n[[New South Wales]] [[Railway signalling|signalling systems]] generally follow [[British Empire|British]] precepts, however '''[[United States|American]]''' influence has increased somewhat since the 1990s. Originally trains ran on the time-interval system and authority of the timetable. From the early 1870s, several near-misses and minor derailments led to serious discussion of improved safe-working arrangements and the implementation of interlocking. Despite this, very little action was taken until 1877, when a new rule book including the Staff & Ticket and Block [[Telegraphy|Telegraph systems]] was finally printed. The ink was barely dry on 30 January 1878 when two trains collided head-on at [[Emu Plains railway station|Emu Plains]], killing three. This put an end to timetable working on single lines. [[Absolute block signalling|Absolute Block Telegraph]] for double lines came in 1879, Saxby & Farmer's mechanical interlocking in 1881, [[Tyer's Electric Train Tablet|Tyer's Electric Tablet]] in 1888 (lasting until 1959) and the Electric Staff system in 1891. Tyer's One-Wire Block began to replace the original Preece's Patent instruments from 1891. Sykes' Lock & Block was used on a few suburban sections from 1900. Tyer's Three-Wire Block was used for permissive block working on the Up Relief line from [[Concord West railway station|Concord West]] to [[North Strathfield railway station|North Strathfield]] Junction from 1911 until 1983. In 1913, the two-wire New South Wales Standard Block, which was similar in principle to Lock & Block, became the standard for new installations. It was unique in having a fourth position, known as Train Arrived, and a different sequence of operation to standard British arrangements.<ref>Department of Railways, New South Wales: Regulations for [[Train]] Signalling by Block Telegraph on Double Lines, 1967</ref> The last of these instruments were removed from [[Exeter railway station, New South Wales|Exeter]], [[Bundanoon railway station|Bundanoon]] and [[Wingello railway station|Wingello]] on the [[Main Southern railway line|Main South line]] in 2007. By 1907, the majority of signalling equipment, including signals and mechanical lever frames, were being manufactured in-house under the direction of the English-born signal engineer, C.L.N.F. Wilkin. The NSWR Signal Engineer's Branch supplanted McKenzie & Holland as the principal supplier in most installations.\n\n===Power signalling===\n'''Power''' signalling arrived in 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of ([[Sydney]]) [[Station box|Station Box]]. This installation was [[electro-pneumatic]] and controlled from a miniature lever frame supplied by the McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of [[Worcester]], [[England]]. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some control of signals by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 lever pistol grip power frame in the new Sydney Station West [[signalbox]] in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused '[[Station box|Station Box]]' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.\n\n====Track Circuit Block====\nOn 22 June 1913 the first automatic signals in [[Australia]] were brought into use between [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]] Loco Junction ([[Illawarra Junction]]) and [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham]], replacing Tyer's One-Wire Block. These signals were of the two-arm home and distant type. From that time on, a form of Track Circuit Block (TCB) worked from mechanical and power signalboxes, with the gradual spread of automatic signalling between stations, became the standard for new installations, initially with semaphore but later colour light signals. In practice, the term Track Circuit Block was generally shortened to 'Track Block', of which there were a number of (mainly administrative) variations in the rules, such as Double Line Track Block and Single Line Track Block. Track Circuit Block, now known officially as the Rail Vehicle Detection system,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rail Infrastructure Corporation (now RailCorp) Network Rules, 2002</ref> remains the standard system of train signalling on all main lines in the [[RailCorp]] network.\n\n====Absolute-Permissive Block====\nThe American Absolute-Permissive Block system, known locally as Single Line Automatic, was installed on the [[Molong-Dubbo railway line|Molong to Dubbo line]] by C.B. Byles in 1925. Train movements on the line were regulated by a Train Controller at [[Yeoval, New South Wales|Yeoval]], who directed the issue of crossing orders for trains on the line. While a technical success, the traffic density did not warrant the cost of maintaining the signalling system. It was replaced by the first installation of the Divisible Miniature Electric Staff system in 1933.{{sfn|Dargan|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n====Signalboxes in 2012====\n[[Signalling control|Signalboxes]] remain scattered throughout the [[Sydney Trains]] network, with thirty-six still in regular use in 2012, including nine controlled by local station staff, twenty-six by dedicated Signallers and one shared by both. The majority of these were commissioned before 1970, a few of which have been in continuous use since the late nineteenth century, albeit surviving in a modified state. Eleven are still fitted with Byles-type mechanical lever frames and five have early relay interlocking with Individual Function Switch (IFS) or similar [[electric switch]] panels. Newcastle Signalbox, commissioned in 1936 by W.F. Barton, has the last [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] miniature lever power frame in Australia, and one of few remaining in the world. Sixteen signalboxes are fitted with route control relay/solid state interlocking systems and hardwired panels, and three are equipped solely with computerised, VDU-based route control. A few other signalling installations exist outside the RailCorp network, under the control of other rail operators. [[Junee railway station|Junee]] and [[Broadmeadow railway station|Broadmeadow]] are home to integrated electronic control centres, both of which are run by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]], custodian of the busiest lines in the country network of the state.\n\n===Three-position lower quadrant semaphore===\nStandard British three position lower quadrant [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphore signals]], with an arm for each direction and spectacles mounted below them, were used from the introduction of time-interval working in 1855. The last signal of this type was removed from [[Girilambone]] in 1952. The Danger signal was given by a horizontal arm and red light during darkness. The arm was lowered 45 degrees, with a green light for Caution, to \"slacken speed\", and to an almost vertical position in a slotted post with a white light for All Right.<ref>Sydney Railway Rules and Regulations, 1855</ref>\n\n===Two-position lower quadrant semaphore===\n[[File:Signal Distant NSW.svg|thumb|The distant signal in NSW has a fixed upper green light]]\nLower Quadrant [[Railway semaphore signal|Semaphore]] signals use an arm that works in a horizontal position and may be lowered to a 45-degree angle, they can only give two indications. In the horizontal position a red light is displayed, in the lowered position a green light is displayed. There are two types of arms. A Distant signal uses a fishtail arm, Home and Starting signals use a square-tail arm.\n\nSemaphore distant signals in [[New South Wales]] are fitted with a fixed green light, positioned above the arm and spectacle, so that they may be easily distinguished from stop signals at night. Although yellow lights were trialled, neither they, nor yellow and black arms were adopted, meaning that distant signal arms are still painted red and white.\n\nIf the Home or Starting signal is at Danger, the Distant signal will be at Caution, its arm in the horizontal position with a green light over a red light exhibited at night. If the Home and Starting signals are Clear, the Distant will be Clear, its arm lowered, with two green lights exhibited at night.\n\nThe term \"Stop\" gradually replaced \"Danger\" for the purpose of identifying the normal position of stop signals in official publications from circa 1927, with both terms mentioned in the rule book issued in that year.<ref>New South Wales Government Railways Rules and Regulations, 1927</ref>\n\n====Combined home and distant signals====\nWhere [[interlocking]]s are closely placed, a Starting signal arm may be fitted above a Distant signal arm. In this case the Starting arm can be placed at Stop and display a red light. As the lower Distant signal arm cannot be cleared while the upper arm is at Stop the signal will show two red lights. The basis for Double Light signalling was thus established by a sequence of Distant and two-arm signals, so that it was then possible to encounter a signal showing two green lights (Clear), followed by a green light over a red light (Caution) then one or two red lights (Stop).\n\n===Upper quadrant semaphore signals===\n[[File:NSW UQ Rail Signals.jpg|thumb|UQ semaphore signals, 3 position auto (right) and 2 position distant (left)]]\nThe power-operated three-position upper quadrant semaphore signal, American in origin, was introduced to [[New South Wales]] by the English signal engineer, C.B. Byles, in 1913. Byles (1871\u20131948) led [[New South Wales Government Railways|New South Wales Railways]] through its introduction of power signalling, from 1911 until 1929.{{sfn|Dargan|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2019}} At night, two lights, one above the other, are exhibited. The spectacle attached to the signal arm has three lenses, that is a green for the vertical clear position and red for the other two lenses. In some cases the semaphore arm moves to the horizontal danger position when the line between the distant signal and the stop signal to which it applies is occupied. The Distant signals capable of exhibiting Danger are fitted with an upper red/green spectacle; the two-position versions have a fixed upper green. The Home/Starting signals give three indications. The arm moves from horizontal displaying a red light, upwards to 45 degrees displaying a green or yellow light, and fully vertical also displaying a green light. In double light areas, the lower light of these signals stays red until a full Clear indication is shown. Therefore, these signals will show the same lights indicated by the [[google:lower+quadrant+semaphore+meaning&rlz=1C1GCEB_enAU891&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8xLncv_3nAhWmxzgGHWBUBrcQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=AYria8k4DVsmgM|Lower Quadrant Semaphore]] Distant and two-arm signals, that is, two greens for Clear, a green over a red for Caution and two reds for Stop.\n\n===Double light colour light===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Sydney_Double_Colour_Signalling_Clear_Aspect.png|alt=|frameless|76x76px]]\n|Green / Green\n|Clear\n|Proceed, expect the next signal to be at Clear\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Preliminary Medium Sydney GIF.gif|frameless|91x91px]]\n|Green / Blinking Yellow\n|Advanced Preliminary Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop after 2 more warning signals\n|Not always provided\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Medium Sydney Trains.png|frameless|84x84px]]\n|Green / Yellow\n|Preliminary Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|Not always provided, but extremely common\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Sydney Trains.png|frameless|85x85px]]\n|Green / Red\n|Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Stop Sydney Trains.png|frameless|83x83px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Shunt Signal Sydney.png|frameless|79x79px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Shunt\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

This system was introduced in 1924 by C.B. Byles. Most of the [[Sydney]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] metropolitan areas are equipped with Double Light Colour Light signals, in accordance with principles established during the tenure of Byles, although some of the signals in the outer suburbs has been replaced with Single Light Colour Light. Both systems have almost the same capabilities, with Double Light Colour Light only having a small advantage in aspect variety.\n\nA basic double light colour light signal consists of two multiple lamp colour light signal heads, one above the other. In case of automatic signals, the upper and lower lights are vertically offset from each other or \"staggered\". Alternatively, the lower light may be directly below the upper light, like a controlled or semi-automatic signal. An 'A' plate is then fixed to the signal post or the tunnel wall adjacent to the signal to identify it as automatic. The term \"semi-automatic\" is no longer mentioned in official publications, although the signals still exist. They are classified according to their instantaneous mode of operation rather than capability, i.e. \"controlled\" or \"automatic\". Automatic signals in tunnels were originally identified by a white marker light, since the lights could not be staggered, but 'A' plates are now used. More commonly used in the [[City Circle]] is a blue 'A' light, which can, when required, extinguish and work as a controlled signal.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/31766/NSG-600-Running-signals.PDF| website=RailSafe| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830142318/https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/31766/NSG-600-Running-signals.PDF| archivedate=30 August 2018| title=NSG 600: Running signals| date=April 2017| author=Sydney Trains}}</ref>\n\nThe simplest and original form of double light colour light signal provides three indications, that is Clear (green over green), Caution (green over red) and Stop (red over red). A fourth indication, known as Medium, is indicated by green over yellow. This equates to the \"double yellow\" in British multiple aspect signalling. The Medium indication was introduced in June 1926, three months after the first double yellow indication was used in the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/31763/NSG-606-Responding-to-signals-and-signs.PDF| website=RailSafe| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830174307/https://railsafe.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/31763/NSG-606-Responding-to-signals-and-signs.PDF| archivedate=30 August 2018| title=NSG 606: Responding to signals and signs| date=April 2017| author=Sydney Trains}}</ref>\n\nFacing junction signals may exhibit an upper yellow light where a diverging route is set. The yellow light was originally said to mean \"attention - proceed at medium speed\" in accordance with a 1924 study by the Institute of Railway Signal Engineers in which Byles participated.<ref>{{cite book| last=Byles| first=C.B.| title=The Electrification of Sydney and Suburban Railways, II - The Signalling System| publisher=Institution of Engineers, Australia| year=1926}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2019}} However, \"medium speed\" was never properly defined and the term has now been removed from the official rule book. The exhibition of an upper yellow light does not impose a specific speed restriction for approaching trains; it is still the responsibility of the driver to be familiar with the route and observe lineside speed boards relating to points and crossings. The turnout indications are as follows: Caution Turnout (yellow over red), meaning proceed on diverging route, prepared to stop at the next signal (originally known as Medium Caution), and Medium Turnout (yellow over yellow), meaning proceed on diverging route, the next signal is exhibiting a proceed indication. Oddly, these indications can also be seen at some trailing junctions, at which only one converging route option is available. Whilst the upper yellow light implies that a reduction in speed may be necessary, this is not consistent with conventional route signalling practice. Turnout and junction signals are the most inconsistent and diverse in the NSW signalling system.\n\n==== Reduced-overlap working and speed control ====\n[[File:Sydney_Trains_Trip_Dropping_Example.gif|alt=|thumb|616x616px|Original 1932 operation of Sydney's Speed Controlled Trips. Note: The Signal that allows the trains to proceed into the platform is a \"Close Up\" signal and conflicting sources say that the small lower light was either White, Yellow or Green.]]\nProjected traffic density warranted the introduction of additional signal indications. One of these was a small green light under the two main red lights of a Stop signal, indicating Low Speed. The Low Speed indication was provided in the [[City Circle|Underground City Railway]] from its opening on 28 February 1932. The standard speed restriction imposed by train stops with the Low Speed indication was originally 17&nbsp;mph. However, at some locations, the maximum permissible speed is as low as 5&nbsp;mph, subject to local conditions. \n\nUp until the City Circle Resignalling of the 1990s, the western stations of the line were able to allow a following train into the platform on a Close Up / Low Speed Signal (Red on Red on a small light) and used the trips spread along the platform to ensure that the arriving train would not get too close to the train still departing. This allowed these stations to deal with 42 trains per hour in either direction provided sub 40 second dwell times. The 1990s resignalling changed the older eastern stations to follow a similar operation, only these days the system will not let a following train in until the previous train has departed completely.\n\nIn the Underground City and [[Eastern Suburbs railway line]]s, a speed restriction of 30&nbsp;mph also applies to the Caution indication. The train stops can be seen dropping as the signals step-up to Medium. Closely spaced 'multi home signals', similar to those used on the [[London Underground]], are also a feature of the Underground City and Eastern Suburbs lines. Speed control by intermediate train stops, based on Byles' system, was introduced on the London Underground following the accident at [[Moorgate]] on 28 February 1975, in which 43 people were killed. These are spread out along the platform at major stations, mostly on the City Circle. When the signal at the end of platform is at stop, they will only drop when the train reaches a predetermined speed, which is lower as the train gets closer to the end of the platform. The last trip will only drop when the train is at around 5&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe sequence of aspects on the approach to a preceding train in areas where the Low Speed indication is in use is as follows: Clear, Medium, Caution, Low Speed, Stop. In rare cases, the Medium indication will be exhibited at two consecutive signals. At some locations, the Low Speed indication will only be exhibited under reduced overlap conditions (e.g. owing to the presence of a train ahead). Under such a configuration, the sequence of aspects will be: Clear, Medium, Caution, Stop, provided the full overlap is available.\n\nAn additional subsidiary indication below a stop signal is the Close Up. This appears similar to the Low Speed indication, except that the subsidiary green light is provided in a separate lamp case below a plate labelled \"CLOSE UP\".<ref>Department of Railways, New South Wales: General Appendix to the Book of Rules and Regulations and to the Working Time-Tables, Part II, 1967</ref> Speed control does not apply to the Close Up indication, which is manually selected by the Signaller in most cases and indicates that the section is clear but the station or junction ahead is blocked. Close Up signals are equivalent to the British warning (\"W\") signal for restricted acceptance. Signals fitted with a Close Up lamp case are increasingly rare.\n\n====Preliminary medium indications and turnout repeaters====\n{{underlinked|section|date=September 2017}}\nA fifth main aspect, Preliminary Medium, is available, with a pulsating yellow light beneath an upper green.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> It is often used before a Medium indication to provide additional notice of the need to reduce speed for a facing junction. The typical sequence of aspects on the approach to a junction where Preliminary Medium is in use is as follows: Clear, Preliminary Medium (with or without directional indicator), Medium, Medium Turnout or Caution Turnout at the junction signal. At some locations, Preliminary Medium may be exhibited at two consecutive signals. Many automatic signals that are not near junctions can also display the Preliminary Medium indication to give additional warning to freight trains about upcoming red signals.\n\nDirectional indicators have been introduced to resolve the [[ambiguity]] that may arise when a medium aspect (green over yellow) can precede either a caution aspect (green over red) or one of the turnout aspects (yellow over red/yellow). The indicator is provided at the signal(s) in rear of a junction signal. When illuminated it displays a white bar, inclined at 45 degrees to the left or right, placed above the main signal heads. The bar is not lit when the next signal applies to the straight route, but is illuminated when the next signal applies to the turnout. The white indicator is proved to be alight before the yellow is displayed.\n\nAt high speed junctions, turnout indications are no longer provided. Instead, the signal in rear of the junction signal is provided with a directional indicator. The junction signal is provided with a route indicator, and exhibits the least-restrictive straight route indication permitted by track circuit occupancy.\n\n=====Double light colour light repeaters=====\nRepeaters in the form of Double Light Colour Light signals are provided at some locations in the metropolitan area. These \"repeaters\" are unusual in that they do not replicate the indication of the stop signals to which they apply. Instead, they are wired like separate block signals or Distant signals. For instance, the repeater will be at green over red when the signal to which it applies is at Stop. The red over red indication will only be exhibited when the line between the repeater and the stop signal is occupied, and is treated as a Permissive Stop.\n\n===Single light colour light===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:NSWR Green.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Green\n|Clear\n|Proceed, expect the next signal to be at Clear\n|\n|-\n|-\n|[[File:Pulsing Yellow SLCL.gif|frameless|85x85px]]\n|Blinking Yellow\n|Preliminary Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|Not always provided\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Steady Yellow NSW.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Yellow\n|Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Red Signal NSW.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:SCSS NSW Shunt.png|frameless|87x87px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Shunt\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

Vernon, Signal Engineer. This system is derived directly from British multiple-aspect signalling, with American influence in the form of a marker light. Using a single green light for Clear and a single yellow light for Caution, these signals exhibit a single red light with a smaller lower red \"marker\" light for Stop. Turnout indications can be provided with three yellow lights at an angle of 45 degrees under a red light in the main signal head. The fourth indication, Medium, which equates to the British Preliminary Caution, is a flashing or pulsating yellow light.\n\nOriginally, a permanently illuminated white marker light was positioned beneath the main colour light head in lieu of the red marker light. The caution turnout indication was a single yellow in the main head over three white lights at an angle of 45 degrees.<ref>State Rail Authority of New South Wales: Basic Safeworking Manual; Safeworking Signalling Manual, 1993</ref> The red marker light was introduced from 1965. The majority of early single light colour light signals had either been replaced or retrofitted with red marker lights, by 2000.\n\nSome Upper Quadrant Semaphore signals were adapted as Single Light Colour Light signals giving the same colour indications while retaining the arm. The sequence of indications of Single Light Colour Light signals is one green light for Clear, one yellow light for Caution, one red light with a lower smaller red light for Stop. The last Upper Quadrant Semaphore Single Light signal was on the Up South Main Line at [[Moss Vale railway station|Moss Vale]], which was replaced in 2007 when Moss Vale and Moss Vale Junction were resignalled, resulting in the closure of local signal boxes at those locations.\n\n=== NSW Dwarf Signals ===\nThese signals are in use within SLCL and DLCL Territory.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Sydney Shunt Red.png|frameless|85x85px]]\n|2 Red Lights\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Sydney Shunt Proceed.png|frameless|78x78px]]\n|Yellow Light\n|Caution Proceed\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until you pass the next signal.

However, much of the Queensland rail network is still controlled by legacy signalling systems such as Staff and Ticket.\n\nThe system contains the main four aspects from British Rail signalling; Clear, Preliminary Caution, Caution and Danger. It also uses White lights to display Shunt Signals. The variance in QLD's system is with the Special Caution indication. This means the same thing as Caution just with an additional 40&nbsp;km/h speed restriction. The signal is used when the overlap passed the next red signal is occupied by either a train, or a conflicting junction. It means almost the same thing as \"Low Speed\" in Sydney's signalling system, there are just no speed proving systems and the speed limit is 40, not 25 km/h.\n\nQLD makes use of Junction indicators at the signals protecting junctions. These are a separate display of white lights above the main signal head that are angled in the direction of the turnout; they can also be of a theatre display type which shows a letter or multiple letters which refer to the location that the train is being directed to.\n\nIn order to provide warning of upcoming turnouts, QLD makes use of Dynamic Speed Indicators, these are boxes below the main set of lights which contain yellow text. The text will tell the driver what speed they are allow to pass the next signal, the presence of the text will warn them of an upcoming turnout. The usual speeds that can be displayed are: 25, 40, 50 and 80.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenslandscalemodels.com.au/Qld%20Colour%20Light%20Signalling.doc.pdf|title=Queensland Colour Light Signalling|last=Driver|first=Lincoln|date=|website=queenslandscalemodels.com.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== QLD Dwarf Signals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Brisbane Shunt Signal.png|frameless|94x94px]]\n|Red and White Lights\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Brisbane Shunt Proceed.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|2 White Lights spaced diagonally\n|Proceed \n(Restricted)\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

Nearly all [[signal box]]es in South Australia have now been closed, with most rail traffic being coordinated through [[Centralized traffic control|centralised traffic control]] systems, either under [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] control from Mile End or [[Adelaide Metro]] control from Adelaide. Where these two networks interface, such as at the [[Goodwood railway station|Goodwood level crossing]] or at Torrens Junction, control is usually from ARTC after release from Adelaide Metro. Despite the almost uniform CTC control some signal boxes still exist, such as Dry Creek South although they are not normally switched in.\n\n===Speed signalling===\n{{underlinked|section|date=September 2017}}\nBefore 1988, signalling in the metropolitan area was three-position speed signalling, similar to the Victorian system. All mainline signals have two signal 'heads' (originally upper quadrant semaphore arms but now colour light, LED or searchlight), both are always lit. The aspects shown depend on the allowable speed for the route set. If the route was for Normal speed, the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the top head, if the move is for Medium speed (35&nbsp;km/h, such as when entering a loop or siding), the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the lower head. The colours displayed by either depended on how many blocks ahead were clear; green if two or more blocks were clear and yellow if only one was clear (i.e. the next signal showed Stop).\n\nHence the aspects (and indications) are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:SA Red.png|frameless|79x79px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:SA green.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Green / Red\n|Clear Normal Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed.\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:SA Amber signal.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Yellow / Red\n|Normal Speed Warning\n|Proceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:SA RTMS.png|frameless|87x87px]]\n|Yellow / Green\n|Reduce to Medium Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed (35 km/h) before the next signal\n|Used before \"Medium speed\" signals\n|None, but prepare to reduce to 35&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Red on Green SA.png|frameless|84x84px]]\n|Red / Green\n|Clear Medium Speed\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 35 km/h)\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|35&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Red on Yellow SA.png|frameless|85x85px]]\n|Red / Yellow\n|Medium Speed Warning\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 35 km/h), but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|35&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Shunt SA.png|frameless|86x86px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Shunt\n|Proceed past signal on sight, expecting to stop short of possible obstruction.\n|Used for shunting movements\n|15&nbsp;km/h\n|}\n'Reduce to Medium speed' (35&nbsp;km/h) is used when the next signal displays one of the Medium speed indications. If the top light (normal speed) only displays red (such as departing from a crossing loop), it is only fitted with a red aspect. If the lower light (medium speed) only displays red, it is often replaced with a red reflector in place of a red light.\n\nMany signals on the ARTC controlled network are \"approach lit\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sa-trackandsignal.net/Pdf%20files/ARTC/ARS-Sig%20symb.pdf| title=Signal Symbols used on drawings of ARTC lines in South Australia| website=SA Track and Signal}}</ref> meaning that they are normally extinguished, but a train on the track circuit(s) in advance of the signal will cause it to illuminate. This is both to save power at remote locations without mains power supply, and an effort to reduce vandalism.\n\n====Dwarf signals====\nDwarf signals can be used to show Low speed aspects at signals where main line aspects are not needed. These were originally upper quadrant disc signals but are now all of the colour light or searchlight variety.

Absolute signals cannot be passed at Stop without permission from the signaller or controller, whereas Permissive signals at Stop can be passed after having stopped for a one-minute waiting period. Absolute signals can be identified by the fact that the two lights are vertically aligned, whereas with Permissive signals they are vertically off-set (staggered on different sides of the post). Dwarf signals are always Absolute.\n\n===Suburban network===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Proceed QLD.png|frameless|83x83px]]\n|Green\n|Clear\n|Proceed, expect the next signal to be at Proceed\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Brissy.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Yellow\n|Caution\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Adelaide Red Signal.png|frameless|83x83px]]\n|Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Adelaide Flashing Yellow.gif|frameless|95x95px]]\n|Blinking Yellow\n|Reduce to Medium Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed before the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Adelaide Suburban Shunt Signal.png|frameless|77x77px]]\n|Red / Two Diagonal White lights\n|Proceed at low Speed\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past next signal.

Be prepared to stop at obstruction.\n|Non-mainline movements\n|15&nbsp;km/h\n|}\nIn 1988 the [[Adelaide Metro]] lines were resignalled with the opening of the Adelaide control centre. The system is quite similar to modern UK colour light signalling, being a route signalling system, though it lacks the double yellow aspect and makes use of 'permissive' signals. There are three basic aspects: red for stop, yellow for caution and green for clear. A reduce to medium speed aspect is also used to give early warning of a divergence, and is given by a flashing yellow light. All aspects are indicated with colour light signals. Despite this re-signalling, some parts of the TransAdelaide network still use the original 3-position speed signalling (such as the Dry Creek to Port Adelaide line).\n\nThere is also a low speed aspect indicated by a lunar-white position-light signal mounted below the main head. It shows two lunar-white lights at 45 degrees (to mimic an upper-quadrant semaphore) to indicate proceed at low speed. These position light signals are also used for dwarf signals and in this case they can also display 'stop' as a red light and lunar-white light in a horizontal row.\n\nJunctions on running signals are indicated by a row of five lunar-white lights angled in the direction of divergence. If multiple routes are to be signalled, several rows may be used.\n\nPermissive signals are indicated by a circular 'P' plate offset below the signal head and Absolute by a square 'A' plate directly below the signal head. As with three-position signalling, dwarf (low speed) signals are always absolute. An 'A' plate in New South Wales or Victoria means the signal is automatic and therefore a Permissive signal, which is again a source of conflicting meaning between the differing signalling systems.\n\nIn the Adelaide station yard Theatre-style route indicators are used on both running signals and shunt signals; platform numbers for 'up' trains and route through the yard for 'down' trains. The down indicators have changed over time. At present, the indicators for Down Trains show the following indications:\n* SM-Seaford Main (Previously SS-South Suburban Line), \n* BM-Belair Main (Previously SM-South Main Line), \n* PM-Port Main Line, \n* NM-North Main Line, \n* RD-Railcar Depot (No longer used), \n* SY-Stabling Siding (No longer used), \n* NY-North Yard.\n\n== Tasmania ==\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\nThe railways of Tasmania predominantly follow the [[UK railway signalling|United Kingdom railway signalling system]]. Routes use [[Lineside signal|lineside signals]] to control the passage of trains within the [[Rail transport in Tasmania|Tasmanian rail network]].\n\n== Victoria ==\n[[File:Mechanical-signalling-north-geelong.jpg|thumb|Mechanical ''2 position'' semaphore signalling at [[North Geelong railway station|North Geelong]]]]\n[[File:Mechanical-interlocking-frame-avenel.jpg|thumb|Mechanical [[interlocking]] frame for signal control at [[Avenel railway station, Victoria|Avenel]]]]\n[[File:Led-colour-light-signal.jpg|thumb|Modern LED colour light ''3 position'' signalling]]\n\n{{see also|Rail transport in Victoria}}<!-- update there first please, then here too -->The [[Rail transport in Victoria|railways of Victoria]] use a mix of [[railway signalling]] practices: British route signalling with home and distant signals (''2 position signalling'') and American speed signalling (''3 position signalling'').{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=x}}\n\n2 Position Signalling is still in use today despite its redundancy. Each signal is either a \"Home\" or a \"Distant\" Signal, where Home Signals can display a Red aspect that tell a driver they must stop, and Distant Signals display a \"Yellow\" aspect that warns the driver that the next home signal is displaying a Red aspect. All signals can display a green aspect that means \"Clear\".\n\nJunction direction indications are given by displaying two aspects side by side on the same signal mast. Only the signal to the same side as the selected route will display the relevant aspect, while the other will be Red.\n\n===== Example of a Signalling Layout of Two Aspect Signalling. =====\nNote that every second signal is a Distant Signal.\n[[File:Melbourne 2 Aspect Signalling Diagram.png|center|frameless|658x658px|Approximately every second signal is a Distant Signal.

Normally two or more signal heads are placed on the same mast (this can often mean one is placed above the other; in which case the upper signal refers to the leftmost route, and the lower to the right most route) and the route they correspond to is designated by the signalling diagrams of the track section. Only one of these signal heads can be given any indication (other than red) at a time.\n[[File:Diverge Right VIC.png|thumb|174x174px|An example of a Diverge Right Signal from Victoria]]\n\nTwo aspect signalling also makes use of the \"Warning\" and \"Proceed\" repeaters mentioned in the Three aspect section, but normally these signals will be used on the boarder between the two sections, to give drivers additional warning when they are entering 3 aspect territory.

Telegraphic block working was then replaced with ''Winters Block'' working between 1883 and 1888,{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=66}} a system that is a predecessor of the ''Double Line Block'' system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the ''Staff and Ticket'' system, with busier lines provided with [[Electric Staff]] working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.\n\nHeavier suburban traffic on the [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne network]] saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required a large number of manned signalboxes to enable trains to run close together.<ref name=\"elect20\">{{cite book|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|last1=Dornan|first1=S.E.|last2=Henderson|first2=R.G.|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|year=1979|isbn=0-909459-06-1|page=20}}</ref> As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the [[Automatic Block Signal|Automatic Block System]] (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers.{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=x}} These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.{{sfn|Fisher|2007|page=89}}\n\n=== Victorian Three Aspect Signalling ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Red Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Red / Red\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Green Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|82x82px]]\n|Green / Red\n|Clear Normal Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed.\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Yellow Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|93x93px]]\n|Yellow / Red\n|Normal Speed Warning\n|Proceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne RMS Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|80x80px]]\n|Yellow / Green\n|Reduce to Medium Speed\n|Proceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed (40 km/h) before the next signal\n|Used before \"Medium speed\" signals\n|None, but reduce to 40&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Medium Clear Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Red / Green\n|Clear Medium Speed\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 40 km/h)\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|40&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Medium Caution Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Red / Yellow\n|Medium Speed Warning\n|Proceed at medium speed (No more than 40 km/h), but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Used when train is required to reduce speed.\n|40&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Shunt.png|frameless|92x92px]]\n|Red / Red / Yellow\n|Low Speed Caution\n|Proceed at no more than 15 km/h, the track section may be occupied and you must stop short of any obstruction\n|Used for shunting movements\n|15&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Warning.png|frameless|87x87px]]\n|Yellow / Yellow\n|Warning\n|Proceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Extremely Rare\n\n\nUsed most often on the boarders between two aspect territory.\n|40 if preceded by \"Medium Speed\" signal.\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Proceed.png|frameless|88x88px]]\n|Green / Yellow\n|Clear\n|Proceed, the next signal is at Normal Speed\n|Extremely Rare\n\n\nUsed most often on the boarders between two aspect territory.\n| -\n|}<br />\n\n=== Victorian Three Aspect Dwarf Signals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example\n!Aspect\n!Name\n!Meaning\n!Use\n!Speed Restriction\n|-\n|[[File:SA Dwarf Purple.png|frameless|94x94px]]\n|Red or Purple Light\n|Stop\n|Stop, do not proceed\n|Non-mainline movements\n|0\n|-\n|[[File:SA Proceed Caution.png|frameless|96x96px]]\n|Yellow Light\n|Low Speed Caution\n|Continue to next signal on sight, at no faster than 15&nbsp;km/h until past the next signal.

[[Leonora, Western Australia|Leonora]] and [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] were also \"widened\" to standard gauge at this time because they were connected through Coolgardie and that railway was decommissioned once the Standard Gauge project was completed.\n\nStaff and Ticket were the primary form of signalling safe working system used in Western Australia apart from major yards and main lines such as the Eastern Goldfields Railway. This has been replaced with Train Orders and no staff and ticket exists in Western Australian and hasn't for more than 20 years.\n\nIn 1967, the standard gauge was completed between Kalgoorlie and [[Kwinana railway station|Kwinana]], with a dual gauge section built in the [[Avon Valley Railway|Avon Valley]] between [[Avon Yard]] and Kwinana. From Avon Yard to Kalgoorlie this is known as the Single Line Automatic Signalling System using absolute block. Absolute block is used all throughout Western Australia with exception to the Pilbara Railways as no information has been attained to cover that area.\n\nA three aspect colour light signal is used in the Western Australian standard gauge railway and this system is almost completely uniform through the network in automatic signalling territory (narrow gauge as well). When a crossing loop is reached, a [[Home signal|Home Signal]] will have a signal for each, with the crossing segment signal being 45 degrees beneath the main line signal and in the direction of the turnout. For example, if the turnout was a right-hand the crossing signal would be on the right side below the main signal. Either signal is taken as the Home signal even if taking the loop. Each has an individual number and letter.\n\nAll branch lines in Western Australia use Train Orders, formerly staff and ticket. Train Orders does utilise a signal at the entrance and the exit of the territory.\n\nThe Western Australian system is very simple to understand but the complexities of leading position lights and other odd attachments to signalling apparatus have been either eradicated or were never part of it. Switchlocks are used to exit mainline CTC territory for sidings, such as CBH yard terminals on the Standard Gauge. The Train Controller must release the switchlock thus interlocking the signals to stop and this is similar to Queensland.\n\nPoints on mainlines in Western Australia are not equipped with leading position light signalling. In fact there is no need for this type of signals as it is just an added cost. This saves money on equipment and also improves the driver's workload by only having to pay attention to critical information during critical phases of approaching signals.\n\nThere are simple yellow light shunt signals on signal posts which authorise movements to the next obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow speed shunt signal indication and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see [[Hines Hill train collision]]) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow speed shunt signal, not meant for mainline operations.\n\nThere are no speed signals in Western Australia's freight system operated by Brookfield Rail<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brookfieldrail.com/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213123431/http://www.brookfieldrail.com/| archivedate=13 February 2017| website=Brookfield Rail| title=(home)}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2019}}</ref> <!-- (unsure about Pilbara) --> and they are either Approach, Outer Home, Home, Departure and Starting signals.<ref name=\"austlii.edu.au\">{{cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/repealed_reg/grab1994379/sch1.html| title=Government Railways Amendment By-Laws 1994 - Schedule| website=AustLII: Western Australian Repealed Regulations}}</ref>\nPerth's urban passenger network is operated by the [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority]] and the Rules are identical to that of the freight, with a few minor differences. One of them is the use of Station Limits boards similar to that used in Train Order territory.\n\n== Contradictory meanings ==\nSignalling systems vary between the states of Australia as each railway was established under the different colonial governments with separate legislation. As with the notorious situation of having different gauges, there are differing signal systems. The [[Victorian Railways]] use Speed Signalling. This has led to similar signal indications giving very different meanings in these two states. For example, in New South Wales Green-over-Red means 'Caution', indicating the next signal is at 'Stop'. In Victoria that same aspect, Green-over-Red, means 'Clear Normal Speed', indicating the next signal is anything but at 'Stop'.\n\nOn the main south line from [[Sydney]], Single Light Colour Light signals are now exclusively used from Spring Creek bridge (south of [[Galong railway station|Galong]]) to [[Albury railway station|Albury]] on the Victorian border. This forms a buffer zone between the areas giving conflicting signal indications. Gradually the remaining Upper Quadrant signals (and Double Light Colour Light signals at Binalong) are being replaced by Single Light Colour Light signals.\n\n=== Table of Contradictory Meanings throughout Australian Railway Networks. ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Aspect\n!Meaning in State 1\n!Meaning in State 2\n!Meaning in State 3\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Sydney Trains.png|frameless|88x88px]] [[File:Melbourne Green Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|82x82px]][[File:SA green.png|frameless|91x91px]] Green / Red\n|NSW\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|Victoria\n\nProceed at normal speed\n|SA\n\nProceed at normal speed\n\n|-\n|[[File:Medium Sydney Trains.png|frameless|85x85px]][[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Proceed.png|frameless|88x88px]] Green / Yellow\n|NSW\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|Victoria,\n\nProceed, the next signal is at Normal Speed\n| -\n|-\n|[[File:Caution Turnout.png|frameless|93x93px]][[File:Melbourne Yellow Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|93x93px]][[File:SA Amber signal.png|frameless|92x92px]] Yellow / Red\n|NSW\n\nProceed over the turnout, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n\n|Victoria\n\nProceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|SA\n\nProceed at normal speed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|-\n|[[File:Medium Turnout.png|frameless|87x87px]][[File:Melbourne Rare Repeater Warning.png|frameless|87x87px]] [[File:Preliminary Caution Brisbane.png|frameless|90x90px]]Yellow / Yellow\n|NSW\n\nProceed over the turnout, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n\n|Victoria,\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the next signal\n|QLD\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n|-\n|[[File:Pulsing Yellow SLCL.gif|frameless|85x85px]][[File:Adelaide Flashing Yellow.gif|frameless|96x96px]][[File:Brisbane Flashing Yellow.gif|frameless|91x91px]]Blinking Yellow\n|NSW Single Colour Light\n\nProceed, but be ready to stop at the signal after next\n<br />\n|Adelaide Suburban Network\n\nProceed at normal speed, but reduce to medium speed (35 km/h) before the next signal\n|QLD\n\nProceed at no more than 25 km/h and be ready to stop at the next signal\n\n|-\n|[[File:Melbourne Medium Caution Signal Searchlight.png|frameless|88x88px]][[File:Perth Shunt.png|frameless|81x81px]][[File:Red on Yellow SA.png|frameless|85x85px]] Red / Yellow\n|Victoria\n\nProceed at medium speed (No more than 40 km/h), but be ready to stop at the next signal\n\n|Perth Suburban Network\n\nShunt.
