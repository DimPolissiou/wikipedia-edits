Dunn]], owner of the John Callahan Trust Company. The company bought land and created new towns along rail lines that it began since Dunn was president of the Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad. Joshua Bates, who [[plat]]ted the town of Batesville, is thought to be the source of the name. On November 1, 1853, the first train from Cincinnati to Indianapolis passed through Batesville.\n\n===Development===\nOnce the railway opened, Dunn and Bates constructed more buildings. George Sims laid out Batesville's first addition in 1858. The following year, German immigrant Henry Boehringer became Batesville's first major builder. A three-story building with a basement on East Pearl Street (formerly known as Broadway Street) became known as the Boehringer Hall because of the dance floor on the third story. The Catholic congregation used the basement before they had built their church.\n\nLouis Walter established Batesville's first [[gristmill]] in 1858. Between 1860 and 1870, Boehringer built a row of apartments and homes on the north side of Batesville on Boehringer Street. Along with building the apartments and housing, Boehringer owned the [[Land lot|lot]] where the Ward School now stands. In 1863 Conrad Rapp purchased numerous lots on East Broadway and bought Walter's gristmill. In 1865, John Brinkman built a hotel and restaurant called the [[Sherman House (Batesville, Indiana)|Sherman House]], named after [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], a [[major general]] that led the [[Union Army]] to its final victory of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] in a campaign that became known as \"[[Sherman's March to the Sea]]\".\n\nSebastian Messersmith built Union Hall in 1865. It was a two-story building on the west side of Main Street (Batesville, Indiana)|Main Street and just north of South Street (Batesville, Indiana)|South Street. Union Hall was used by the fire department for meetings and it was used by the public school while the school building was being rebuilt. It was also used as a boarding house for mill workers and visiting lumber salesman. This was an important building to the citizens of Batesville. Batesville has been known for its many factories built between the 1870s and the present.\n\nIn 1873 the Greeman Bracket Company began manufacturing under the Greeman family name, which was one of the leading businesses for 30 years. The Schrader Furniture Factory was built in 1873, but had to be rebuilt in 1875 after the factory was destroyed by a fire. When the founder Herman Schrader died, the business was bought by John Hillenbrand|John and William Hillenbrand. In 1874, the Union Furniture Factory also burned down and the Blank Bros. Furniture Manufacturing Company was erected the following year. Also, in 1879, Batesville published its first newspaper, ''The Prairie Farmer''.\n\nDuring the 1880s the town of Batesville started its first form of government appointed by the community. The first mayor was George M. Hillenbrand. The first town board served without pay. The board consisted of five officers: Jacob Blank Jr., John Lehmkuehler, John Hillenbrand, William Hillenbrand, and Christian Schwieler. Much of the money that was put toward the town came directly out of the officers' pockets. For example, in February 1883, they donated $153.06 to go toward paying for the town's bills. By September, when the financial report was reviewed, Batesville only had $1.82 in its account. Also during 1883, Batesville began major road construction.\n\nIn 1884 Batesville organized the [[Batesville Casket Company]]. It was managed by J. Spiegel and later purchased by George M. Hillenbrand in February 1906. Also in 1884, the town jail was completed at a cost of $211.55. The inmates were forced to break stone to pay for their stay in the prison.\n\nSeveral developments took place in 1887, including new additions to the town and telephone connections to the town of Oldenburg. These developments were funded by a grant applied for by Mr. Haverkos. Also in 1887, John Hillenbrand and Victor Oberting opened a stone quarry on some of Mr. Hillenbrand's land near Batesville. In December 1887, the town hall was completed. The town hall was separated into two parts: one for the town board and the other for the fire company. The town hall was also rented out for public gatherings.\n\nIn March 1888, the school board made a decision to construct an addition onto the schoolhouse. This proposal estimated that the total cost of the addition would be $1,500. Also in 1888, the first city attorney (James H. Connelly) was appointed at a salary of $35 per year, and many new businesses were added. In this year, Henry F. E. Schrader moved to Batesville and opened a tin shop and built homes. Also, Henry H. Kramer started a grocery store on the corner of Walnut and Boehringer. As well as new stores, a covered bridge was built over the Laughery Creek, making travel much easier.\n\nIn 1889, Batesville finally paved its roads with stone that came from the Hillenbrand and Oberting Stone Quarry. As well as the paving of the roads, Batesville opened the Batesville State Bank. In February 1890, Batesville had built its first sidewalks. Also in the 1890s, street lamps were introduced to Batesville. Originally, these lamps were oil lamps. However, in October, a proposal was written to turn them all into electric lamps, but the proposal was denied. On January 29, 1894, the first electric lamp was placed in front of Town Hall.\n\nIn 1895 a petition was written and accepted to build another school. The total estimated cost would be $5,700. The land would cost $700 and the school building would cost $5,000. In 1897 Batesville decided to stop the use of the electric lamps because of the rates that people had to pay to keep them going, but then in 1898 Batesville decided that they would reduce the rates and only use the lamps when needed.<ref>Wonning, Paul, Batesville Area Historical Society.

Dunn]], owner of the John Callahan Trust Company. The company bought land and created new towns along rail lines that it began since Dunn was president of the Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad. Joshua Bates, who [[plat]]ted the town of Batesville, is thought to be the source of the name. On November 1, 1853, the first train from Cincinnati to Indianapolis passed through Batesville.\n\n===Development===\nOnce the railway opened, Dunn and Bates constructed more buildings. George Sims laid out Batesville's first addition in 1858. The following year, German immigrant Henry Boehringer became Batesville's first major builder. A three-story building with a basement on East Pearl Street (formerly known as Broadway Street) became known as the Boehringer Hall because of the dance floor on the third story. The Catholic congregation used the basement before they had built their church.\n\nLouis Walter established Batesville's first [[gristmill]] in 1858. Between 1860 and 1870, Boehringer built a row of apartments and homes on the north side of Batesville on Boehringer Street. Along with building the apartments and housing, Boehringer owned the [[Land lot|lot]] where the Ward School now stands. In 1863 Conrad Rapp purchased numerous lots on East Broadway and bought Walter's gristmill. In 1865, John Brinkman built a hotel and restaurant called the [[Sherman House (Batesville, Indiana)|Sherman House]], named after [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], a [[major general]] that led the [[Union Army]] to its final victory of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] in a campaign that became known as \"[[Sherman's March to the Sea]]\".\n\nSebastian Messersmith built Union Hall in 1865. It was a two-story building on the west side of Main Street (Batesville, Indiana)|Main Street and just north of South Street (Batesville, Indiana)|South Street. Union Hall was used by the fire department for meetings and it was used by the public school while the school building was being rebuilt. It was also used as a boarding house for mill workers and visiting lumber salesman. This was an important building to the citizens of Batesville. Batesville has been known for its many factories built between the 1870s and the present.\n\nIn 1873 the Greeman Bracket Company began manufacturing under the Greeman family name, which was one of the leading businesses for 30 years. The Schrader Furniture Factory was built in 1873, but had to be rebuilt in 1875 after the factory was destroyed by a fire. When the founder Herman Schrader died, the business was bought by John Hillenbrand|John and William Hillenbrand. In 1874, the Union Furniture Factory also burned down and the Blank Bros. Furniture Manufacturing Company was erected the following year. Also, in 1879, Batesville published its first newspaper, ''The Prairie Farmer''.\n\nDuring the 1880s the town of Batesville started its first form of government appointed by the community. The first mayor was George M. Hillenbrand. The first town board served without pay. The board consisted of five officers: Jacob Blank Jr., John Lehmkuehler, John Hillenbrand, William Hillenbrand, and Christian Schwieler. Much of the money that was put toward the town came directly out of the officers' pockets. For example, in February 1883, they donated $153.06 to go toward paying for the town's bills. By September, when the financial report was reviewed, Batesville only had $1.82 in its account. Also during 1883, Batesville began major road construction.\n\nIn 1884 Batesville organized the [[Batesville Casket Company]]. It was managed by J. Spiegel and later purchased by George M. Hillenbrand in February 1906. Also in 1884, the town jail was completed at a cost of $211.55. The inmates were forced to break stone to pay for their stay in the prison.\n\nSeveral developments took place in 1887, including new additions to the town and telephone connections to the town of Oldenburg. These developments were funded by a grant applied for by Mr. Haverkos. Also in 1887, John Hillenbrand and Victor Oberting opened a stone quarry on some of Mr. Hillenbrand's land near Batesville. In December 1887, the town hall was completed. The town hall was separated into two parts: one for the town board and the other for the fire company. The town hall was also rented out for public gatherings.\n\nIn March 1888, the school board made a decision to construct an addition onto the schoolhouse. This proposal estimated that the total cost of the addition would be $1,500. Also in 1888, the first city attorney (James H. Connelly) was appointed at a salary of $35 per year, and many new businesses were added. In this year, Henry F. E. Schrader moved to Batesville and opened a tin shop and built homes. Also, Henry H. Kramer started a grocery store on the corner of Walnut and Boehringer. As well as new stores, a covered bridge was built over the Laughery Creek, making travel much easier.\n\nIn 1889, Batesville finally paved its roads with stone that came from the Hillenbrand and Oberting Stone Quarry. As well as the paving of the roads, Batesville opened the Batesville State Bank. In February 1890, Batesville had built its first sidewalks. Also in the 1890s, street lamps were introduced to Batesville. Originally, these lamps were oil lamps. However, in October, a proposal was written to turn them all into electric lamps, but the proposal was denied. On January 29, 1894, the first electric lamp was placed in front of Town Hall.\n\nIn 1895 a petition was written and accepted to build another school. The total estimated cost would be $5,700. The land would cost $700 and the school building would cost $5,000. In 1897 Batesville decided to stop the use of the electric lamps because of the rates that people had to pay to keep them going, but then in 1898 Batesville decided that they would reduce the rates and only use the lamps when needed.<ref>Wonning, Paul, Batesville Area Historical Society.

As of the 2010 Census, the city had a population of 77,648,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Largo city, Florida| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> up from 69,371 in [[2000 United States Census|2000]].\n\nLargo was first incorporated in 1905. In 1913, it became the first municipality in Pinellas County to adopt a [[council-manager government]]. It switched back and forth from \"town\" to \"city\" a few times, and became a city again in 1974. It was an exporter of agricultural products until the 1960s population growth began to transform it into a [[commuter town|bedroom community]]. From 1905 to 2010, Largo grew in area from {{convert|9/16|sqmi|km2}} to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}}, and in population from about 300 people to more than 70,000. Largo began as a rural farming community and became the third largest city in Florida's most densely populated county.\n\nLargo is a [[sister city]] to [[Tosayamada, K\u014dchi]], Japan. In 2007, Largo was named a National [[Arbor Day]] Tree City for the 28th year in a row and is the only city in Tampa Bay that is a Sterling Tree City.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings of the area===\n{{Main|Timeline of Largo history}}\nThe native inhabitants of the Largo area were the [[Tocobaga]] Indians. They are also known as the Safety Harbor culture from their archeological remains near present-day [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]]. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] came to Florida in the 16th century.  In the 18th century, the Tocobaga had been virtually destroyed after years of exposure to European diseases, Spanish settlement efforts and warfare between Spain and England. The Largo area, like the rest of Pinellas County, was largely deserted.  In 1763, Spain transferred sovereignty of Florida to The United Kingdom. In 1783, Florida fell to Spanish sovereignty once again until it was transferred to the United States in 1821. By 1845, a surveyor recorded the location of Lake Tolulu, apparently south of present-day East Bay Drive and roughly where the Largo Central Park Nature Preserve is today.\n\n[[Image:Largo Central Park Nature Preserve01.JPG|thumb|right|Boardwalk across wetlands in Largo Central Park Nature Preserve, the bed of former Lake Largo]]\nLater, homesteaders to the Largo area were the families of James and Daniel McMullen around 1852. The McMullens and other settlers raised cattle, grew citrus and vegetables and fished. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Largo area residents fought for the [[Confederate States of America]]. James and Daniel McMullen were members of the [[1st Florida Special Cavalry Battalion|\"Cow Cavalry\"]] driving Florida cattle to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[the Carolinas]] to help sustain the war effort.  Other area residents served on [[blockade runner]]s.  Still others left the area to serve in the Confederacy's armies. After the war, Largo area residents returned to farming, ranching, and raising citrus. The [[Orange Belt Railway]] reached the area in 1888. By this time Lake Tolulu had been renamed Lake Largo, and residents of the community west of the lake adopted the name \"Largo\".\n\n===Early Largo===\n[[Image:Largo, florida city hall 02small.jpg|thumb|left|Largo City Hall]]\nThe Town of Largo was incorporated in 1905. Lake Largo was drained in 1916 to make way for growth and development. Between 1910 and 1930, Largo's population increased about 500%. Then and for decades afterwards, Largo's economy was based on agriculture\u2014[[citrus]] groves, [[cattle ranch]]es, and [[Pig farming|hog farms]], as well as [[turpentine]] stills and [[sawmill]]s. Largo is best remembered as \"Citrus City\", from the time it was a citrus packing, canning and shipping center.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] was unkind to Largo. Largo lacked the financial resources to meet its obligations.  Largo reverted to its 1913 boundaries and [[charter]]. The population dropped approximately 30%. The debt incurred by the issuance of bonds in the late 1920s was not paid off until after [[World War II]].\n\n===Rapid growth ===\n[[Image:Taylor Park, Largo, florida01small.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Lake Park is a county park in Largo on 8th Avenue SW]]\nThe years after [[World War II]] saw rapid growth as people began moving into the area and Largo annexed surrounding lands. During the [[nuclear arms race]], electronics companies like [[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]] boosted the economy. The population increased to about 5,000 in 1960, to about 20,000 in 1970, and to about 70,000 in 2005. Largo's original area was 9/16th of a square mile. By 1982, Largo had grown to about {{convert|13|sqmi|km2|0}} and to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}} in 2010. The groves, farms, ranches and forests have mostly given way to homes and shopping centers and light industry. The increased population resulted in a need for increased city services. All departments saw rapid growth and improvements in quality, especially under the leadership of the late Mayor Thom Feaster. In 1995, Largo Central Park opened on the site of the old Pinellas County Fairgrounds. It is the setting for the Largo Central Park Performing Arts Center and the Largo Public Library.\n\nIn the 2006 commission elections, Largo achieved two milestones furthering its former motto of \"City of Progress\". [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Patricia Gerard]] became the city's first female mayor. She narrowly defeated incumbent mayor [[Robert E. Jackson]], in a bitterly contested race. (Dr. Jackson had been the longest serving elected Democrat in Pinellas County.) The voters' choice between these two candidates decided the major issue of the election:  that the city would not revert to a mayor-dominated process of governance in lieu of the continuing role for the seven-member commission acting as non-partisans\u2014that is, deliberating independently and equally with the mayor and deciding democratically the political issues of the city.\n\nAlso, the city elected its first commissioner of [[African-American]] descent, Rodney J. Woods, in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] against a former commissioner.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the iconic Largo [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]], which was constructed shortly after completion of Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the change because of the tower's decay and because a deteriorating landmark at a busy intersection was not an uplifting and memorable sight. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a small garden area in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.<ref name=\"Its time for Largo clock tower to go\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article1000360.ece |title=Removal of Largo Clock Tower |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLargo is located at {{Coord|27|54|30|N|82|46|40|W}} (27.908355, \u221282.777791).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is centrally located in Pinellas County, touching the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to the southwest and [[Tampa Bay]] to the northeast. [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] is Largo's neighbor to the north. To the northwest are the towns of [[Belleair, Florida|Belleair]] and [[Belleair Bluffs, Florida|Belleair Bluffs]]. The city of [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] lies south of eastern Largo. [[Seminole, Florida|Seminole]] lies south of western Largo. The unincorporated community of [[Ridgecrest, Florida|Ridgecrest]] forms a large enclave between western and central Largo. A number of county enclaves pepper the City of Largo.\n\n[[File:Largo, FL street flooding during TS Debby, June 2012.jpg|thumb|A Largo street floods after [[Tropical Storm Debby (2012)]]]]\nIn 2010, Largo's total area was {{convert|48.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|45.6|sqkm|order=flip}} was land and {{convert|2.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 5.22%, was water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Largo city, Florida |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> As of 2004, there were {{convert|651|acre|km2|1}} of park lands. The city's lowest elevation is sea level. At its highest, the city's elevation is about {{convert|69|ft|m|0}}. Largo is dotted with a number of lakes, the largest of which is Taylor Lake at {{convert|53|acre|m2}}. Allen's Creek drains northeast Largo, flowing into Tampa Bay. McKay Creek flows through southwest Largo into the Intracoastal Waterway. The McKay Creek basin is prone to flooding.\n\n===Climate===\nLargo is located on the Pinellas Peninsula, so that its climate is moderated by its proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and Tampa Bay.

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] came to Florida in the 16th century.  In the 18th century, the Tocobaga had been virtually destroyed after years of exposure to European diseases, Spanish settlement efforts and warfare between Spain and England. The Largo area, like the rest of Pinellas County, was largely deserted.  In 1763, Spain transferred sovereignty of Florida to The United Kingdom. In 1783, Florida fell to Spanish sovereignty once again until it was transferred to the United States in 1821. By 1845, a surveyor recorded the location of Lake Tolulu, apparently south of present-day East Bay Drive and roughly where the Largo Central Park Nature Preserve is today.\n\n[[Image:Largo Central Park Nature Preserve01.JPG|thumb|right|Boardwalk across wetlands in Largo Central Park Nature Preserve, the bed of former Lake Largo]]\nLater, homesteaders to the Largo area were the families of James and Daniel McMullen around 1852. The McMullens and other settlers raised cattle, grew citrus and vegetables and fished. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Largo area residents fought for the [[Confederate States of America]]. James and Daniel McMullen were members of the [[1st Florida Special Cavalry Battalion|\"Cow Cavalry\"]] driving Florida cattle to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[the Carolinas]] to help sustain the war effort.  Other area residents served on [[blockade runner]]s.  Still others left the area to serve in the Confederacy's armies. After the war, Largo area residents returned to farming, ranching, and raising citrus. The [[Orange Belt Railway]] reached the area in 1888. By this time Lake Tolulu had been renamed Lake Largo, and residents of the community west of the lake adopted the name \"Largo\".\n\n===Early Largo===\n[[Image:Largo, florida city hall 02small.jpg|thumb|left|Largo City Hall]]\nThe Town of Largo was incorporated in 1905. Lake Largo was drained in 1916 to make way for growth and development. Between 1910 and 1930, Largo's population increased about 500%. Then and for decades afterwards, Largo's economy was based on agriculture\u2014[[citrus]] groves, [[cattle ranch]]es, and [[Pig farming|hog farms]], as well as [[turpentine]] stills and [[sawmill]]s. Largo is best remembered as \"Citrus City\", from the time it was a citrus packing, canning and shipping center.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] was unkind to Largo. Largo lacked the financial resources to meet its obligations.  Largo reverted to its 1913 boundaries and [[charter]]. The population dropped approximately 30%. The debt incurred by the issuance of bonds in the late 1920s was not paid off until after [[World War II]].\n\n===Rapid growth ===\n[[Image:Taylor Park, Largo, florida01small.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Lake Park is a county park in Largo on 8th Avenue SW]]\nThe years after [[World War II]] saw rapid growth as people began moving into the area and Largo annexed surrounding lands. During the [[nuclear arms race]], electronics companies like [[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]] boosted the economy. The population increased to about 5,000 in 1960, to about 20,000 in 1970, and to about 70,000 in 2005. Largo's original area was 9/16th of a square mile. By 1982, Largo had grown to about {{convert|13|sqmi|km2|0}} and to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}} in 2010. The groves, farms, ranches and forests have mostly given way to homes and shopping centers and light industry. The increased population resulted in a need for increased city services. All departments saw rapid growth and improvements in quality, especially under the leadership of the late Mayor Thom Feaster. In 1995, Largo Central Park opened on the site of the old Pinellas County Fairgrounds. It is the setting for the Largo Central Park Performing Arts Center and the Largo Public Library.\n\nIn the 2006 commission elections, Largo achieved two milestones furthering its former motto of \"City of Progress\". [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Patricia Gerard]] became the city's first female mayor. She narrowly defeated incumbent mayor [[Robert E. Jackson]], in a bitterly contested race. (Dr. Jackson had been the longest serving elected Democrat in Pinellas County.) The voters' choice between these two candidates decided the major issue of the election:  that the city would not revert to a mayor-dominated process of governance in lieu of the continuing role for the seven-member commission acting as non-partisans\u2014that is, deliberating independently and equally with the mayor and deciding democratically the political issues of the city.\n\nAlso, the city elected its first commissioner of [[African-American]] descent, Rodney J. Woods, in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] against a former commissioner.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the iconic Largo [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]], which was constructed shortly after completion of Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the change because of the tower's decay and because a deteriorating landmark at a busy intersection was not an uplifting and memorable sight. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a small garden area in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.<ref name=\"Its time for Largo clock tower to go\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article1000360.ece |title=Removal of Largo Clock Tower |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLargo is located at {{Coord|27|54|30|N|82|46|40|W}} (27.908355, -82.777791).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is centrally located in Pinellas County, touching the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to the southwest and [[Tampa Bay]] to the northeast. [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] is Largo's neighbor to the north. To the northwest are the towns of [[Belleair, Florida|Belleair]] and [[Belleair Bluffs, Florida|Belleair Bluffs]]. The city of [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] lies south of eastern Largo. [[Seminole, Florida|Seminole]] lies south of western Largo. The unincorporated community of [[Ridgecrest, Florida|Ridgecrest]] forms a large enclave between western and central Largo. A number of county enclaves pepper the City of Largo.\n\n[[File:Largo, FL street flooding during TS Debby, June 2012.jpg|thumb|A Largo street floods after [[Tropical Storm Debby (2012)]]]]\nIn 2010, Largo's total area was {{convert|48.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|45.6|sqkm|order=flip}} was land and {{convert|2.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 5.22%, was water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Largo city, Florida| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> As of 2004, there were {{convert|651|acre|km2|1}} of park lands.

Largo is dotted with a number of lakes, the largest of which is Taylor Lake at {{convert|53|acre|m2}}. Allen's Creek drains northeast Largo, flowing into Tampa Bay. McKay Creek flows through southwest Largo into the Intracoastal Waterway. The McKay Creek basin is prone to flooding.\n\n===Climate===\nLargo is located on the Pinellas Peninsula, so that its climate is moderated by its proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and Tampa Bay. In the winter, temperatures are warmer on the Pinellas Peninsula than on mainland Florida. Winters are generally drier than the rest of the year. Most of the rainfall comes in the summer, when the sea breeze carries moisture from the Gulf inland. Largo's record low is {{convert|22|F}}, recorded on December 13, 1962. Largo's record high is {{convert|100|F}}, recorded on July 5, 1995.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color: #000080\" height=\"17\" | Month\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Jan\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Feb\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Mar\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Apr\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | May\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Jun\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Jul\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Aug\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Sep\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Oct\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Nov\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Dec\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Year\n|-\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Average high [\u00b0F]\n| style=\"background: #FFff66; color:#000080;\" | 69\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 71\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 75\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 80\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 86\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 89\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 90\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 90\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 88\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 83\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 77\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 71\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 80\n|-\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" height=\"16;\" | Average low temperature [\u00b0F]\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 54\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 55\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 60\n| style=\"background: #FFff66; color: black;\" | 65\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 71\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 75\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 77\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 77\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 76\n| style=\"background: #FFee66; color: black;\" | 70\n| style=\"background: #FFFF66; color: black;\" | 63\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 56\n| style=\"background: #FFff66; color: black;\" | 66\n|-\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Rainfall (inches)\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.76\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.87\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 3.29\n| style=\"background: #ccffff;\" | 1.92\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.80\n| style=\"background: #6688FF;\" | 6.09\n| style=\"background: #6688FF;\" | 6.72\n| style=\"background: #0011FF;\" | 8.26\n| style=\"background: #0055FF;\" | 7.59\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.64\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.04\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.60\n| style=\"background: #0033FF;\" | 49.58\n|}\n<!-- Yahoo Weather. http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USFL0271_f.html. online.
