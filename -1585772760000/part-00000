The terminus, [[Allhallows-on-Sea railway station]], was north of the old village, and the new part of the settlement grew up around the railway station which had opened on 16 May 1932. The railway named its resort Allhallows-on-Sea in all its publicity. The planned development never took place, partly because of the onset of the [[Second World War]], and the railway station closed on to 4 December 1961. There is now a holiday park that includes a 9-hole golf course, fresh water fishing lake, and a small entertainments complex with both indoor and outdoor pool. This park is operated by Bourne Leisure Ltd.\n\nIt was just after the [[First World War]] that Kent County Council and London County Council proposed the transformation of the remote and inhospitable marshland hamlet of All-Hallows into a major seaside resort, after the fashion of Victorian [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]]. By the 1930s the river front at Avery Farm, about a mile north of the village, was set to become a holiday resort.\n\nAllhallows-on-Sea was planned as the best holiday resort in Europe, and was to have the largest swimming pool in the UK with the first artificial wave generator in Europe, and an amusement park four times the size of the [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] complex.\n\nOn 13 February 1937, the Gravesend Reporter carried the following:\n<blockquote>\n\"During the next month the Amusement Park will be started with a building of {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}}.\nWhen completed the park will be four times the size of the famous one at [[Blackpool]]. Other features include: zoological gardens, yachting centre, physical training stadium, the largest swimming pool in the country with artificial waves, holiday camp and 5,000 houses, up to date hotels, restaurants, theatres and cinemas. The development, which will take some seven years to complete is costing millions of pounds, and when finished, the town covering something like two and half square miles of land, should prove to be of great convenience to the millions of Londoners, and others.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe railway line was constructed with these proposals in mind. A large 1930s style pub, the British Pilot, was built to supersede the village inn, the Rose and Crown Tavern (now converted to a dwelling). Just opposite the parish church and old village shop (now long closed) and on the new approach way to the railway station, an art deco styled block of flats was added. But the overall plan never attracted the number of holidaymakers expected.\n\nThe holiday park is [[Haven Holidays]].\n\n==Allhallows at war==\nOn the morning of 15 October 1940, a [[Royal Air Force]] Squadron was involved in combat over the [[River Medway]], and during a skirmish with a [[Messerschmitt]] Bf 109, the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] R6642 was damaged by enemy fire, forcing [[Pilot Officer]] J. W. Lund to bail out. The aircraft crashed on the shoreline of the River Medway near Allhallows at 11:50 am. The pilot was rescued by the [[Royal Navy|Navy]], but his aircraft remained a wreck on the tidal mudflats of Allhallows until the summer of 1998 when the site was excavated.\n\n==Future proposals==\nIn November 2011, [[Lord Foster]] published proposals to improve the transport system of south east England. Under these proposals, called the [[Thames Hub integrated infrastructure vision|Thames Hub]], new [[high-speed rail]] lines would be built connecting [[Kent]] and [[Europe]] with [[north London]], and the north east and north west of England. The scheme would also involve the remodelling of the [[Thames Estuary]], by the construction of a [[airport|four-runway airport]] on the Isle of Grain, partially on land reclaimed from the estuary but including land at Allhallows and [[Lower Stoke]].

These cells are then used to treat various cancer types when co-administered with bispecific SMDC adaptor molecules.

Anti-tumor activity in mice is induced only when both the universal CAR T cells plus the correct antigen-specific adaptor molecules are present.

Treatment of antigenically heterogeneous tumors can be achieved by administration of a mixture of the desired antigen-specific adaptors.\n\nThere are several challenges of current CAR T cell therapies, such as:\n* the inability to control the rate of cytokine release and tumor lysis\n* the absence of an off switch that would terminate cytotoxic activity when tumor eradication is complete\n* a requirement to generate a different CAR T cell for each unique tumor antigen may be solved or mitigated using the adaptor approach.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1538-7445.AM2017-LB-187 |title=Abstract LB-187: New methods for controlling CAR T cell-mediated cytokine storms |journal=Cancer Research |volume=77 |issue=13 Supplement |pages=LB-187 |year=2017 |last1=Lee |first1=Yong Gu |last2=Chu |first2=Haiyan |last3=Low |first3=Philip S |lay-url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-t-cell-cancer-treatment.html |laysource=Medical Xpress |laydate=April 21, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://endocyte.com/technology/smdc/ SMDC technology]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327012636/http://endocyte.com/technology/smdc/ |date=2016-03-27 }} ENDOCYTE</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Endocyte announces promising preclinical data for application of SMDC technology in CAR T cell therapy in late-breaking abstract at American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting 2016 |publisher=Endocyte |date=April 19, 2016 |url=http://investor.endocyte.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=965753 |access-date=December 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730115500/http://investor.endocyte.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=965753 |archive-date=July 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gene therapy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells CAR T Cells: Engineering Patients' Immune Cells to Treat Their Cancers]\n\n[[Category:Cancer immunotherapy]]\n[[Category:Gene therapy]]\n[[Category:Immune system]]\n[[Category:Leukemia]]\n[[Category:Lymphoma]]\n[[Category:T cells]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCancer treatment:Journal cites:, templated 2 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_antigen_receptor_T_cell"}
