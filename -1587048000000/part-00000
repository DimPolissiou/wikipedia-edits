Silver, fractured mirrors, and tin foil were the basic decorating materials loved by early amphetamine users of the sixties. Name covered the whole factory in silver, even the elevator. Warhol's years at the Factory were known as the Silver Era. Aside from the prints and paintings, Warhol produced shoes, films, sculptures and commissioned work in various genres to brand and sell items with his name. His first commissions consisted of a single silkscreen portrait for $25,000, with additional canvases in other colors for $5,000 each. He later increased the price of alternative colors to $20,000 each. Warhol used a large portion of his income to finance the Factory.<ref name=\"Factory Made 2003\"/>\n\nThe Factory was the hip hangout for artistic types, [[amphetamine]] (speed) users, and the [[Warhol superstars]]. It was famed for its groundbreaking parties. In the studio, Warhol's workers would make [[silkscreen]]s and [[lithograph]]s under his direction. In 1968, Warhol moved the Factory to the sixth floor of the [[Decker Building]], 33 Union Square West, near [[Max's Kansas City]], a club which Warhol and his entourage frequently visited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |website=Max's Kansas City |date=March 25, 2010 |title=Warhol Automobile Paintings To Finally See Daylight}}</ref> By the time Warhol had achieved a reputation, he was working day and night on his paintings. Warhol used silkscreens so that he could mass-produce images the way corporations mass-produced consumer goods. To increase production, he attracted a m\u00e9nage of [[adult film]] performers, [[drag queens]], socialites, drug addicts, musicians, and free-thinkers who became known as the Warhol Superstars, to help him. These \"art-workers\" helped him create his paintings, starred in his films, and created the atmosphere for which the Factory became legendary.\n\nSpeaking in 2002, musician [[John Cale]] said, \"It wasn't called the Factory for nothing. It was where the [[assembly line]] for the silkscreens happened. While one person was making a silkscreen, somebody else would be filming a [[Screen Tests (films)|screen test]]. Every day something new.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBilly Name brought in the red couch which became a prominent furnishing at the Factory, finding it on the sidewalk of 47th street during one of his \"midnight outings.\" The sofa quickly became a favorite place for Factory guests to crash overnight, usually after coming down from [[amphetamine|speed]].

Almost all his work filmed at the Factory featured nudity, graphic sexuality, [[recreational drugs|drug use]], same-sex relations and [[transgender]] characters in much greater proportion to what was being shown in mainstream cinema. By making the films, Warhol created a sexually lenient environment at the Factory for the \"[[happenings]]\" staged there, which included fake weddings between drag queens, porn film rentals, and vulgar plays. What was called [[free love]] took place in the studio, as sexuality in the 1960s was becoming more open and embraced as a high ideal. Warhol used footage of sexual acts between his friends in his work, such as in ''[[Blue Movie]]'', a 1969 film directed, produced, written and cinematographed by Warhol. The film, starring [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] and [[Louis Waldon]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WS-2002-2005\">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |website=warholstars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie |url-access=subscription |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9807E4D91739EF3BBC4852DFBE668382679EDE |date=August 10, 1969 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[Holly Woodlawn]] and [[Jackie Curtis]] were noted [[drag queens]] who were part of the Factory group, as was [[transgender]] woman [[Candy Darling]]. Andy Warhol frequently used these women and other sexual non-conformists in his films, plays, and events. Because of the constant drug use and the presence of sexually liberal artists and radicals, drugged orgies were a frequent happening at the Factory. Warhol met [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] at an [[orgy]] in 1962:\n\n{{quote|I was at an orgy, and [Warhol] was, ah, this great presence in the back of the room.

Silver, fractured mirrors, and tin foil were the basic decorating materials loved by early amphetamine users of the sixties. Name covered the whole factory in silver, even the elevator. Warhol's years at the Factory were known as the Silver Era. Aside from the prints and paintings, Warhol produced shoes, films, sculptures and commissioned work in various genres to brand and sell items with his name. His first commissions consisted of a single silkscreen portrait for $25,000, with additional canvases in other colors for $5,000 each. He later increased the price of alternative colors to $20,000 each. Warhol used a large portion of his income to finance the Factory.<ref name=\"Factory Made 2003\"/>\n\nThe Factory was the hip hangout for artistic types, [[amphetamine]] (speed) users, and the [[Warhol superstars]]. It was famed for its groundbreaking parties. In the studio, Warhol's workers would make [[silkscreen]]s and [[lithograph]]s under his direction. In 1968, Warhol moved the Factory to the sixth floor of the [[Decker Building]], 33 Union Square West, near [[Max's Kansas City]], a club which Warhol and his entourage frequently visited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |website=Max's Kansas City |date=March 25, 2010 |title=Warhol Automobile Paintings To Finally See Daylight}}</ref> By the time Warhol had achieved a reputation, he was working day and night on his paintings. Warhol used silkscreens so that he could mass-produce images the way corporations mass-produced consumer goods. To increase production, he attracted a m\u00e9nage of [[adult film]] performers, [[drag queens]], socialites, drug addicts, musicians, and free-thinkers who became known as the Warhol Superstars, to help him. These \"art-workers\" helped him create his paintings, starred in his films, and created the atmosphere for which the Factory became legendary.\n\nSpeaking in 2002, musician [[John Cale]] said, \"It wasn't called the Factory for nothing. It was where the [[assembly line]] for the silkscreens happened. While one person was making a silkscreen, somebody else would be filming a [[Screen Tests (films)|screen test]]. Every day something new.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBilly Name brought in the red couch which became a prominent furnishing at the Factory, finding it on the sidewalk of 47th street during one of his \"midnight outings.\" The sofa quickly became a favorite place for Factory guests to crash overnight, usually after coming down from [[amphetamine|speed]].

Almost all his work filmed at the Factory featured nudity, graphic sexuality, [[recreational drugs|drug use]], same-sex relations and [[transgender]] characters in much greater proportion to what was being shown in mainstream cinema. By making the films, Warhol created a sexually lenient environment at the Factory for the \"[[happenings]]\" staged there, which included fake weddings between drag queens, porn film rentals, and vulgar plays. What was called [[free love]] took place in the studio, as sexuality in the 1960s was becoming more open and embraced as a high ideal. Warhol used footage of sexual acts between his friends in his work, such as in ''[[Blue Movie]]'', a 1969 film directed, produced, written and cinematographed by Warhol. The film, starring [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] and [[Louis Waldon]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WS-2002-2005\">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |website=warholstars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie |url-access=subscription |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9807E4D91739EF3BBC4852DFBE668382679EDE |date=August 10, 1969 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[Holly Woodlawn]] and [[Jackie Curtis]] were noted [[drag queens]] who were part of the Factory group, as was [[transgender]] woman [[Candy Darling]]. Andy Warhol frequently used these women and other sexual non-conformists in his films, plays, and events. Because of the constant drug use and the presence of sexually liberal artists and radicals, drugged orgies were a frequent happening at the Factory. Warhol met [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] at an [[orgy]] in 1962:\n\n{{quote|I was at an orgy, and [Warhol] was, ah, this great presence in the back of the room.

Foreign interests noticed several key benefits of operating in China, including the vast market, availability of cheap labor and raw materials, longer work hours, and lower transport costs. The first foreign enterprises were established immediately after the Sino-Japanese War of 1904-05, within a few years of the first Chinese factories. Due to the treaty ending the war, foreign entities were able to operate exempt from tariff duties and with fewer political restrictions than native companies. The British came first, but the Japanese arrived soon after.<ref name=\":2\">Shepherd, Jack. \u201cSalvaging the Textile Industry in China.\u201d ''Far Eastern Survey'' 8.15 (1939): 171\u2013175. ''JSTOR''. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Rapid Expansion ===\nSince imports of Western manufactured goods stopped during World War I, the cotton industry in both China and Japan developed rapidly to fill the need in Asia. Initially, all of the machines and accessories were imported from Britain or America. This foreshadowed an industry trend of importing technology and exporting finished goods that describes most of the 20th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, in the 1920s, Japan became the main supplier of machines, and some began to be built in China as well, establishing the textile-machine-tools industry which would eventually grow enough in volume to supply neighboring countries as well.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bhatt | first1 = V. M. | year = 1947 | title = China's Cotton Textile Industry | url = | journal = Pacific Affairs | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 309\u2013312 }}</ref>\n\n=== Competition with Japanese Companies ===\nWhile the total capacity of the Chinese mills into the 1930s was greater than that of the Japanese, a third of the cotton yarn and half of the cotton goods produced in China were made by Japanese owned mills.<ref name=\":1\" /> Japanese mills had the advantage of better technology and more capital, while Chinese mills were limited due to management inefficiency, lack of organization, and financial weakness. In particular, the Japanese mills were able to survive the depression in the 1930s because they had stronger and more stable financial backing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, in Shandong, which is still industrially important today, the Japanese had the advantage of the significant transportation and utilities infrastructure developed by the Germans when they used the city as a port for trade. When the Japanese arrived in 1914, they were able to use these resources and the local people's knowledge of machinery to very quickly establish seven modern spinning mills. Thanks to the electric power set up by the Germans, they were also able to implement electric powered weaving machines throughout the 1930s to significantly increase the production efficiency of mills.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1934, the National Economic Council of China established the Cotton Industry Commission, meant to improve the quality of Chinese raw cotton and to improve spinning, weaving, and dyeing techniques. However, due to the lack of capital and high outstanding debt of the Chinese mills, production costs were still high. In 1936, Chinese mills began to crop up inland instead of on the coast in an attempt to have more competitive costs and prices. The inland mills allowed them to sit closer to raw materials and the rural weaving markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, war suddenly broke out and devastated both the Chinese and Japanese textile industries.\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War ===\nIn July 1937, there were some 2.75 million spindles and 25,500 looms under Chinese ownership. There were 2.38 million spindles and 33,800 looms under Japanese control. Plans had been underway by both camps to expand dramatically, but most were stopped by the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the British controlled some 220,000 spindles and 4,000 looms.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the fighting started, the Chinese Government commissioned a group to help mill owners move their equipment inland. Areas such as Shantung, Honan, and Wuhan were able to move tons of equipment inland before the Japanese arrived, essentially clearing out existing mills and setting up new ones. However, around Shanghai, the fighting started so suddenly that only the equipment inside the International Settlement survived. Approximately 44% of the Chinese mills were located in and around Shanghai, and as a result, 60 Chinese owned mills possessing about 70% of Chinese-run manufacturing equipment were lost. A large number of small weaving and dyeing workshops were also destroyed. When mills were not entirely destroyed, they were either operated by Japanese companies or transformed into hospitals or military headquarters. Most mills around Shanghai were too badly damaged to get fully running again quickly and were simply transformed to military use, but in the North, mills soon resumed work under the Japanese. However, these Japanese controlled mills were constantly harassed by guerrillas or revolting workers. The Japanese were further hindered by the exhaustion of raw materials, scarcity of labor, and marketing difficulties due to nationalistic conflicts. For example, when they evacuated their Qingdao mills for a few months in late 1937, the mills were in ruins when they returned.<ref name=\":2\" /> Soon the Japanese began to offer a system of \"cooperative management\" to the Chinese mill owners. Under this organization, there would be Japanese management and the Japanese would get 51% of the profits. Meanwhile, all repair costs would be borne by the Chinese. Most owners rejected this system.\n\n==== The Rong Family's Shenxin Mills ====\nThe Rong brothers, Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng, became the so-called \"cotton and flour kings\" due to their empire of the ten Shenxin [[textile mill]]s and sixteen Maoxin and Fuxin flour mills. By the mid-1930s, the Rongs held almost 20% of spindles in Chinese owned textile mills.<ref name=\":4\">Parks M. Coble. \u201c[http://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/History/Parks%20Coble%202013%20WSU%20talk%20(1).pdf The Historical Roots of Shanghai\u2019s Modern Miracle.]\u201d Asian Studies Lecture Series. Weber State University. 2013.</ref> However, in August 1937, they lost five of their seven Shanghai mills. Two were bombed and taken over by military forces, while the other three fell under Japanese control. The last two surviving mills were in the International Settlement, which was relatively protected from Japanese attacks as a zone of neutrality. While mills were encouraged to move inland and many did, the ones that stayed in Shanghai like the last two Shenxin mills registered as foreign entities for protection. They \"leased\" their mills to foreign owners and hired fake foreign managers so that they could fly a foreign flag. In fact, since the two mills were actually over capacity before the conflict, they operated more efficiently during this period, and one actually expanded and increased output.<ref name=\":6\"/> Even though the industry had taken a big hit, any mills that were not destroyed enjoyed decent profits due to high demand and low supply. This incentivized industrialists who were still in the area to rebuild mills, and they were able to bring the area back up to 40% of prewar production.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the Pacific War erupted, the International Settlement came under heavy fire, and British or American registration made factories a target. The Japanese took over the Rongs' remaining two mills on the grounds that they were enemy property. However, since the Chinese were no longer Japan's biggest enemy, the military was ready to restore Chinese mills in Shanghai to industrialists willing to work with the occupation. The Japanese opposed returning the mills that they had restored and maintained, especially without a payment in return for all of the rebuilding they had to do. However, the Chinese manufacturers argued that they could more easily operate in the Chinese market and gain access to cotton produced in rural areas. One industrialist also appealed to a Japanese government connection of his who was a strong advocate for Pan-Asianism, and returning the mills to establish good relations was seen as a symbol of the Pan-Asian movement. In return, the industrialists were required to show public support for the Japanese, and many plant managers joined the control organizations of the puppet government.\n\nHowever, Japan still controlled a significant amount of the raw cotton in China, so most of the cotton was either shipped to Japan or given to Japanese mills in China. Due to this lack of cotton, several of the Shenxin mills stopped production while others operated at a fraction of their capacity. The Rongs had to turn to the black market to continue profitable operation. They rented out their equipment to smaller rural workshops that could more easily evade control and tax.<ref name=\":6\"/> Ultimately, this willingness to work with and around the political powers of the time allowed the Rongs to survive, as well as the other prominent mill families of the time.\n\n=== Recovering from War ===\nChina's [[textile industry]] only became dominated by the Chinese after the defeat of Japan in 1945, which gave China ownership of many well-equipped and efficient manufacturing units. However, Chinese management was limited in technical and managerial skill. Furthermore, because of the deterioration with lack of maintenance of many plants during the war, efficiency in 1947 varied between 65-80% of prewar standards. Combined with the loss of spindles due to the destruction of the war, output was only 40% of 1937 output.<ref name=\":3\" /> After Japan's retreat, the Chinese government took over 40 mills and incorporated them into the Chinese Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), arguing that government management would get the mills running again most quickly. The government wanted the mills to clothe the army and to produce enough profit to reduce the government budget deficit. It also wanted to organize the mills to take over markets formerly supplied by Japan and to alleviate the clothing shortage in China and thus take over the domestic textile market. Ultimately this resulted in the government controlling 50% of China's textile industry. However, one of the actual reasons these mills were more efficient was because the Japanese had maintained the equipment in their mills well during the war. Yet even with easier access to capital, the government made no moves to expand its mills, indicating a lack of desire to invest but rather a desire to reap profits.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPrivate mills continued to try to grow, but major obstacles included high production costs due to inflation and scarcity of foreign exchange with which to buy raw cotton, machinery, and supplies. The war had wreaked havoc on the land, and the textile machine tool industry which had been prospering was largely lost. Finally, as the Chinese Communist Party rose to power, many mill owners packed their bags and moved their operations to Hong Kong to survive, allowing the next stage of development to take place in Hong Kong.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Economy of China}}\n\n[[Category:Textile industry of China]]\n", "text_old": "The '''textile industry in China''' is the largest in the world in both overall production and exports.<ref name=\"total\">{{cite news |title=Where is China's Textile and Apparel Industry Going?|url=https://cpianalysis.org/2015/07/24/where-is-chinas-textile-and-apparel-industry-going/|publisher=China Policy Institute|date=July 24, 2015}}</ref> [[China]] exported $274 billion in [[textile]]s in 2013, a volume that was nearly seven times that of [[Bangladesh]], the second largest exporter with $40 billion in exports.<ref name=\"TNN\">{{cite web|author1=TNN|title=India overtakes Germany and Italy, is new world No. 2 in textile exports|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-overtakes-Germany-and-Italy-is-new-world-No-2-in-textile-exports/articleshow/35973054.cms|work=Times of India|accessdate=2 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050752/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-overtakes-Germany-and-Italy-is-new-world-No-2-in-textile-exports/articleshow/35973054.cms|archivedate=30 June 2016|date=3 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> This accounted for 43.1% of global clothing exports.<ref name=\":0\">Carlos Braso Broggi.

Foreign interests noticed several key benefits of operating in China, including the vast market, availability of cheap labor and raw materials, longer work hours, and lower transport costs. The first foreign enterprises were established immediately after the Sino-Japanese War of 1904-05, within a few years of the first Chinese factories. Due to the treaty ending the war, foreign entities were able to operate exempt from tariff duties and with fewer political restrictions than native companies. The British came first, but the Japanese arrived soon after.<ref name=\":2\">Shepherd, Jack. \u201cSalvaging the Textile Industry in China.\u201d ''Far Eastern Survey'' 8.15 (1939): 171\u2013175. ''JSTOR''. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Rapid Expansion ===\nSince imports of Western manufactured goods stopped during World War I, the cotton industry in both China and Japan developed rapidly to fill the need in Asia. Initially, all of the machines and accessories were imported from Britain or America. This foreshadowed an industry trend of importing technology and exporting finished goods that describes most of the 20th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, in the 1920s, Japan became the main supplier of machines, and some began to be built in China as well, establishing the textile-machine-tools industry which would eventually grow enough in volume to supply neighboring countries as well.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bhatt | first1 = V. M. | year = 1947 | title = China's Cotton Textile Industry | url = | journal = Pacific Affairs | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 309\u2013312 }}</ref>\n\n=== Competition with Japanese Companies ===\nWhile the total capacity of the Chinese mills into the 1930s was greater than that of the Japanese, a third of the cotton yarn and half of the cotton goods produced in China were made by Japanese owned mills.<ref name=\":1\" /> Japanese mills had the advantage of better technology and more capital, while Chinese mills were limited due to management inefficiency, lack of organization, and financial weakness. In particular, the Japanese mills were able to survive the depression in the 1930s because they had stronger and more stable financial backing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, in Shandong, which is still industrially important today, the Japanese had the advantage of the significant transportation and utilities infrastructure developed by the Germans when they used the city as a port for trade. When the Japanese arrived in 1914, they were able to use these resources and the local people's knowledge of machinery to very quickly establish seven modern spinning mills. Thanks to the electric power set up by the Germans, they were also able to implement electric powered weaving machines throughout the 1930s to significantly increase the production efficiency of mills.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1934, the National Economic Council of China established the Cotton Industry Commission, meant to improve the quality of Chinese raw cotton and to improve spinning, weaving, and dyeing techniques. However, due to the lack of capital and high outstanding debt of the Chinese mills, production costs were still high. In 1936, Chinese mills began to crop up inland instead of on the coast in an attempt to have more competitive costs and prices. The inland mills allowed them to sit closer to raw materials and the rural weaving markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, war suddenly broke out and devastated both the Chinese and Japanese textile industries.\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War ===\nIn July 1937, there were some 2.75 million spindles and 25,500 looms under Chinese ownership. There were 2.38 million spindles and 33,800 looms under Japanese control. Plans had been underway by both camps to expand dramatically, but most were stopped by the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the British controlled some 220,000 spindles and 4,000 looms.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the fighting started, the Chinese Government commissioned a group to help mill owners move their equipment inland. Areas such as Shantung, Honan, and Wuhan were able to move tons of equipment inland before the Japanese arrived, essentially clearing out existing mills and setting up new ones. However, around Shanghai, the fighting started so suddenly that only the equipment inside the International Settlement survived. Approximately 44% of the Chinese mills were located in and around Shanghai, and as a result, 60 Chinese owned mills possessing about 70% of Chinese-run manufacturing equipment were lost. A large number of small weaving and dyeing workshops were also destroyed. When mills were not entirely destroyed, they were either operated by Japanese companies or transformed into hospitals or military headquarters. Most mills around Shanghai were too badly damaged to get fully running again quickly and were simply transformed to military use, but in the North, mills soon resumed work under the Japanese. However, these Japanese controlled mills were constantly harassed by guerrillas or revolting workers. The Japanese were further hindered by the exhaustion of raw materials, scarcity of labor, and marketing difficulties due to nationalistic conflicts. For example, when they evacuated their Qingdao mills for a few months in late 1937, the mills were in ruins when they returned.<ref name=\":2\" /> Soon the Japanese began to offer a system of \"cooperative management\" to the Chinese mill owners. Under this organization, there would be Japanese management and the Japanese would get 51% of the profits. Meanwhile, all repair costs would be borne by the Chinese. Most owners rejected this system.\n\n==== The Rong Family's Shenxin Mills ====\nThe Rong brothers, Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng, became the so-called \"cotton and flour kings\" due to their empire of the ten Shenxin [[textile mill]]s and sixteen Maoxin and Fuxin flour mills. By the mid-1930s, the Rongs held almost 20% of spindles in Chinese owned textile mills.<ref name=\":4\">Parks M. Coble. \u201c[http://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/History/Parks%20Coble%202013%20WSU%20talk%20(1).pdf The Historical Roots of Shanghai\u2019s Modern Miracle.]\u201d Asian Studies Lecture Series. Weber State University. 2013.</ref> However, in August 1937, they lost five of their seven Shanghai mills. Two were bombed and taken over by military forces, while the other three fell under Japanese control. The last two surviving mills were in the International Settlement, which was relatively protected from Japanese attacks as a zone of neutrality. While mills were encouraged to move inland and many did, the ones that stayed in Shanghai like the last two Shenxin mills registered as foreign entities for protection. They \"leased\" their mills to foreign owners and hired fake foreign managers so that they could fly a foreign flag. In fact, since the two mills were actually over capacity before the conflict, they operated more efficiently during this period, and one actually expanded and increased output.<ref name=\":6\"/> Even though the industry had taken a big hit, any mills that were not destroyed enjoyed decent profits due to high demand and low supply. This incentivized industrialists who were still in the area to rebuild mills, and they were able to bring the area back up to 40% of prewar production.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the Pacific War erupted, the International Settlement came under heavy fire, and British or American registration made factories a target. The Japanese took over the Rongs' remaining two mills on the grounds that they were enemy property. However, since the Chinese were no longer Japan's biggest enemy, the military was ready to restore Chinese mills in Shanghai to industrialists willing to work with the occupation. The Japanese opposed returning the mills that they had restored and maintained, especially without a payment in return for all of the rebuilding they had to do. However, the Chinese manufacturers argued that they could more easily operate in the Chinese market and gain access to cotton produced in rural areas. One industrialist also appealed to a Japanese government connection of his who was a strong advocate for Pan-Asianism, and returning the mills to establish good relations was seen as a symbol of the Pan-Asian movement. In return, the industrialists were required to show public support for the Japanese, and many plant managers joined the control organizations of the puppet government.\n\nHowever, Japan still controlled a significant amount of the raw cotton in China, so most of the cotton was either shipped to Japan or given to Japanese mills in China. Due to this lack of cotton, several of the Shenxin mills stopped production while others operated at a fraction of their capacity. The Rongs had to turn to the black market to continue profitable operation. They rented out their equipment to smaller rural workshops that could more easily evade control and tax.<ref name=\":6\"/> Ultimately, this willingness to work with and around the political powers of the time allowed the Rongs to survive, as well as the other prominent mill families of the time.\n\n=== Recovering from War ===\nChina's [[textile industry]] only became dominated by the Chinese after the defeat of Japan in 1945, which gave China ownership of many well-equipped and efficient manufacturing units. However, Chinese management was limited in technical and managerial skill. Furthermore, because of the deterioration with lack of maintenance of many plants during the war, efficiency in 1947 varied between 65-80% of prewar standards. Combined with the loss of spindles due to the destruction of the war, output was only 40% of 1937 output.<ref name=\":3\" /> After Japan's retreat, the Chinese government took over 40 mills and incorporated them into the Chinese Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), arguing that government management would get the mills running again most quickly. The government wanted the mills to clothe the army and to produce enough profit to reduce the government budget deficit. It also wanted to organize the mills to take over markets formerly supplied by Japan and to alleviate the clothing shortage in China and thus take over the domestic textile market. Ultimately this resulted in the government controlling 50% of China's textile industry. However, one of the actual reasons these mills were more efficient was because the Japanese had maintained the equipment in their mills well during the war. Yet even with easier access to capital, the government made no moves to expand its mills, indicating a lack of desire to invest but rather a desire to reap profits.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPrivate mills continued to try to grow, but major obstacles included high production costs due to inflation and scarcity of foreign exchange with which to buy raw cotton, machinery, and supplies. The war had wreaked havoc on the land, and the textile machine tool industry which had been prospering was largely lost. Finally, as the Chinese Communist Party rose to power, many mill owners packed their bags and moved their operations to Hong Kong to survive, allowing the next stage of development to take place in Hong Kong.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Economy of China}}\n\n[[Category:Textile industry of China]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_industry_in_China"}
