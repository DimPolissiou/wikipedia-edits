Manufactured by [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]], they were introduced into service on the [[Main Southern railway line|Main South]] and [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra]] lines where they would spend most of their New South Wales careers hauling passenger and freight services. Among the services they hauled were the ''[[Canberra Express]]'', ''[[Intercapital Daylight]]'', ''[[South Coast Daylight Express]]'', ''[[Southern Aurora]]'', ''[[Spirit of Progress]]'' and ''[[Sydney/Melbourne Express]]''.\n\nIn 1980 42220 was rebuilt by Clyde Engineering, [[Rosewater, South Australia|Rosewater]], receiving an AR16 alternator, a new electrical system and ''Super Series'' wheel slip technology. It was a test bed for many of the features incorporated into the [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|81 class]].<ref name=RailDigestFeb2000>\"The 422 class locomotives of NSW\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' February 2000 page 42</ref>\n\nFrom 1982 they began to operate through to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]]. This ceased in February 1990 when non air-conditioned locomotives would no longer be accepted by Victorian drivers.<ref>\"Locomotives and Traffic Victorian Standard Gauge\" ''Railway Digest'' March 1990 page 104</ref>\n\nWith the formation of [[National Rail Corporation|National Rail]], the 422s were all allocated to the new interstate carrier in July 1995 pending delivery of its [[NR class]] locomotives.<ref>\"80 Class Return to the NSW North Coast on National Rail Freights\" ''Railway Digest'' August 1995 page 14</ref> This saw them again frequently operating to Melbourne, albeit usually as second units and over new territory to [[Parkes railway station|Parkes]] via [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] and from August 1996 via the [[North Coast railway line, New South Wales|North Coast line]] to [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland#Transport|Brisbane]].<ref name=RailDigestFeb2000/><ref>\"Locomotives and Traffic 422s to Brisbane\" ''Railway Digest'' October 1996 page 31</ref> When they were returned to [[FreightCorp]] in September 1997, their Southern duties were now being handled by [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|Class 81s]] so most were stored.<ref>\"Locomotives and Traffic Motive Power\" ''Railway Digest'' September 1997 page 33</ref>\n\nIn 1999 42202 and 42206 were sold to FreightCorp's North Coast sub-contractor, [[Interail|Northern Rivers Railroad]] passing with the business to [[Aurizon|QR National]] in May 2002.<ref name=AuscisionModels>[http://www.auscisionmodels.com.au/422_class_page.htm NSWGR 422/22/FL/HL Class Locomotive] Auscision Models</ref>\n\nBy January 2000 only 42203 and 42220 remained in service with FreightCorp; these having been fitted with air-conditioning. These were retained primarily to operate [[CountryLink]] services from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] to [[Griffith railway station|Griffith]] and from January 2000 over new ground on the ''[[Outback Xplorer|Outback Express]]'' to [[Broken Hill railway station|Broken Hill]].<ref>\"Riding the Outback Express\" ''Railway Digest'' March 2000 page 22</ref> These were sold to [[CFCL Australia|Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia]] in 2001 and later rebuilt as HL203 and FL220.<ref name=AuscisionModels/>\n\nIn May 2000, the other 16 were sold to the [[Genesee & Wyoming Australia|Australian Southern Railroad]] and transferred in one movement from [[Werris Creek railway station|Werris Creek]] where they had been stored to [[Dry Creek railway station|Dry Creek]], [[Adelaide]]<ref>\"FreightCorp 422s Sold to Private Operator\" ''Railway Digest'' June 2000 page 14</ref> where they were gradually reactivated. Some were placed in service operating construction trains on the [[Adelaide-Darwin railway|Alice Springs to Darwin line]] as well as in South Australia and Western Australia. Others returned to New South Wales on hire to other operators. It was decided to rebuild all 16 as the 22 class which among other modifications saw air-conditioning fitted, although only 14 ended up being completed at [[Downer Rail]], [[Port Augusta]].<ref

1969/70.\n\n==History==\nThe 422 class were the first Australian locomotives built with non-streamlined dual cab bodies. Manufactured by [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]], they were introduced into service on the [[Main Southern railway line|Main South]] and [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra]] lines where they would spend most of their New South Wales careers hauling passenger and freight services. Among the services they hauled were the ''[[Canberra Express]]'', ''[[Intercapital Daylight]]'', ''[[South Coast Daylight Express]]'', ''[[Southern Aurora]]'', ''[[Spirit of Progress]]'' and ''[[Sydney/Melbourne Express]]''.\n\nIn 1980 42220 was rebuilt by Clyde Engineering, [[Rosewater, South Australia|Rosewater]], receiving an AR16 alternator, a new electrical system and ''Super Series'' wheel slip technology. It was a test bed for many of the features incorporated into the [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|81 class]].<ref name=RailDigestFeb2000>\"The 422 class locomotives of NSW\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' February 2000 page 42</ref>\n\nFrom 1982 they began to operate through to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]]. This ceased in February 1990 when non air-conditioned locomotives would no longer be accepted by Victorian drivers.<ref>\"Locomotives and Traffic Victorian Standard Gauge\" ''Railway Digest'' March 1990 page 104</ref>\n\nWith the formation of [[National Rail Corporation|National Rail]], the 422s were all allocated to the new interstate carrier in July 1995 pending delivery of its [[NR class]] locomotives.<ref>\"80 Class Return to the NSW North Coast on National Rail Freights\" ''Railway Digest'' August 1995 page 14</ref> This saw them again frequently operating to Melbourne, albeit usually as second units and over new territory to [[Parkes railway station|Parkes]] via [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] and from August 1996 via the [[North Coast railway line, New South Wales|North Coast line]] to [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland#Transport|Brisbane]].<ref name=RailDigestFeb2000/><ref>\"Locomotives and Traffic 422s to Brisbane\" ''Railway Digest'' October 1996 page 31</ref> When they were returned to [[FreightCorp]] in September 1997, their Southern duties were now being handled by [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|Class 81s]] so most were stored.<ref>\"Locomotives and Traffic Motive Power\" ''Railway Digest'' September 1997 page 33</ref>\n\nIn 1999 42202 and 42206 were sold to FreightCorp's North Coast sub-contractor, [[Interail|Northern Rivers Railroad]] passing with the business to [[Aurizon|QR National]] in May 2002.<ref name=AuscisionModels>[http://www.auscisionmodels.com.au/422_class_page.htm NSWGR 422/22/FL/HL Class Locomotive] Auscision Models</ref>\n\nBy January 2000 only 42203 and 42220 remained in service with FreightCorp; these having been fitted with air-conditioning. These were retained primarily to operate [[CountryLink]] services from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] to [[Griffith railway station|Griffith]] and from January 2000 over new ground on the ''[[Outback Xplorer|Outback Express]]'' to [[Broken Hill railway station|Broken Hill]].<ref>\"Riding the Outback Express\" ''Railway Digest'' March 2000 page 22</ref> These were sold to [[CFCL Australia|Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia]] in 2001 and later rebuilt as HL203 and FL220.<ref name=AuscisionModels/>\n\nIn May 2000, the other 16 were sold to the [[Genesee & Wyoming Australia|Australian Southern Railroad]] and transferred in one movement from [[Werris Creek railway station|Werris Creek]] where they had been stored to [[Dry Creek railway station|Dry Creek]], [[Adelaide]]<ref>\"FreightCorp 422s Sold to Private Operator\" ''Railway Digest'' June 2000 page 14</ref> where they were gradually reactivated. Some were placed in service operating construction trains on the [[Adelaide-Darwin railway|Alice Springs to Darwin line]] as well as in South Australia and Western Australia. Others returned to New South Wales on hire to other operators. It was decided to rebuild all 16 as the 22 class which among other modifications saw air-conditioning fitted, although only 14 ended up being completed at [[Downer Rail]], [[Port Augusta]].<ref

It was included in his 1871 novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'', the sequel to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865). The book tells of Alice's adventures within the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|back-to-front world]] of [[Looking-Glass Land]].\n\nIn an early scene in which she first encounters the chess piece characters [[White King (Through the Looking-Glass)|White King]] and [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]], Alice finds a book written in a seemingly unintelligible language. Realizing that she is travelling through an inverted world, she recognises that the verses on the pages are written in [[mirror-writing]]. She holds a mirror to one of the poems and reads the reflected verse of \"Jabberwocky\". She finds the nonsense verse as puzzling as the odd land she has passed into, later revealed as a dreamscape.<ref name=\"AAW64\"/>\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is considered one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English.<ref name=\" Gardner\">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |title=The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition|year=1999 |publisher=W.

Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1871]]\nA decade before the publication of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and the sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', Carroll wrote the first stanza to what would become \"Jabberwocky\" while in [[Croft on Tees]], close to [[Darlington]], where he lived as a child. <!-- we need to check this source b/c he lived in Daresbury - unless they moved to Darlington which is confusing. --> It was printed in 1855 in ''[[Mischmasch]]'', a periodical he wrote and illustrated for the amusement of his family. The piece was titled \"Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" and read:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTwas bryllyg, and ''y<sup>e</sup>'' slythy toves\nDid gyre and gymble in ''y<sup>e</sup>'' wabe:\nAll mimsy were ''y<sup>e</sup>'' borogoves;\nAnd ''y<sup>e</sup>'' mome raths outgrabe.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nCarroll wrote the letter-combination ''y<sup>e</sup>'' throughout the poem for the word ''the'' in order to approximate the [[Middle English|Middle]] and [[Early Modern English]] scribal abbreviation [[Image:EME ye.svg|EME ye.svg]] - a variant of the letter [[Thorn (letter)#Middle and Early Modern English|\u00de (thorn)]] in combination with the superscript E. The poem was printed first in mock-mediaeval lettering as a \"relic of ancient Poetry\" and printed again beneath \"in modern characters\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/lewis-carroll-juvenilia-stanza-of-anglo-saxon-poetry |title=Lewis Carroll juvenilia: 'Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry' - The British Library |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of the poem was written during Carroll's stay with relatives at [[Whitburn, South Tyneside|Whitburn]], near [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The story may have been partly inspired by the local Sunderland area legend of the [[Lambton Worm]],<ref>''A Town Like Alice's'' (1997) Michael Bute Heritage Publications, Sunderland</ref><ref>''Alice in Sunderland'' (2007) Brian Talbot Dark Horse publications.</ref> and the tale of the [[Sockburn Worm]] while writing in [[Croft on Tees]] and [[Whitburn, South Tyneside|Whitburn]] in [[Sockburn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/CroftLewisCarroll.html|title=Vikings and the Jabberwock: Croft, Sockburn and Sadberge|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll, who would have known of [[chapbooks]] such as ''[[The World Turned Upside Down]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-world-turned-upside-down-18th-century/ |title=The World Turned Upside Down (18th century) |publisher=The Public Domain Review |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref> and stories such as \"[[Samuel Foote|The Great Panjandrum]]\".

The illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the contemporary Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of [[palaeontology]] and geology. Stephen Prickett notes that in the context of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Gideon Mantell|Mantell's]] publications and vast exhibitions of dinosaurs, [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|such as those at the Crystal Palace]] from 1854, it is unsurprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock \"the leathery wings of a [[Pterosaur|pterodactyl]] and the long scaly neck and tail of a [[sauropod]].\"<ref Name=\"Prickett\">Prickett, Stephen (2005) ''Victorian Fantasy'' Baylor University Press p80 {{ISBN|1-932792-30-9}}</ref>\n\n==Lexicon==\n{{Quote box |align=right |\n |quote  =<poem>\n\"'''Jabberwocky'''\"\n\n\u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\n\u201cBeware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!\u201d\n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the manxome foe he sought\u2014\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\nAnd as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\n\nOne, two!

When [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions:\n\n<blockquote>\"It seems very pretty,\" she said when she had finished it, \"but it's rather hard to understand!\" (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) \"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas\u2014only I don't exactly know what they are!

In later writings he discussed some of his lexicon, commenting that he did not know the specific meanings or sources of some of the words; the linguistic ambiguity and uncertainty throughout both the book and the poem may largely be the point.<ref name=\"Parsons\"/>\n\nIn ''Through the Looking-Glass'', the character of [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], in response to Alice's request, explains to her the non-sense words from the first stanza of the poem; however, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. For example, following the poem, a \"rath\" is described by Humpty as \"a sort of green pig\".<ref name=\"AAW96\"/> Carroll's notes for the original in ''[[Mischmasch]]'' suggest a \"rath\" is \"a species of Badger\" that \"lived chiefly on cheese\" and had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> The appendices to certain ''Looking Glass'' editions, however, state that the creature is \"a species of land turtle\" that lived on swallows and oysters.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> Later critics added their own interpretations of the lexicon, often without reference to Carroll's own contextual commentary. An extended analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book ''[[The Annotated Alice]]'' by [[Martin Gardner]].\n\nIn 1868 Carroll asked his publishers, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], \"Have you any means, or can you find any, for printing a page or two in the next volume of Alice in reverse?\" It may be that Carroll was wanting to print the whole poem in mirror writing. Macmillan responded that it would cost a great deal more to do, and this may have dissuaded him.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/>\n\nIn the author's note to the Christmas 1896 edition of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' Carroll writes, \"The new words, in the poem Jabberwocky, have given rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronunciation, so it may be well to give instructions on ''that'' point also. Pronounce 'slithy' as if it were the two words, 'sly, thee': make the 'g' ''hard'' in 'gyre' and 'gimble': and pronounce 'rath' to rhyme with 'bath.'\"<ref>Carroll, Lewis (2005) ''Through the Looking Glass''. Hayes Barton Press p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the Preface to ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', Carroll wrote, \"[Let] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce 'slithy toves.' The 'i' in 'slithy' is long, as in 'writhe', and 'toves' is pronounced so as to rhyme with 'groves.' Again, the first \"o\" in \"borogoves\" is pronounced like the 'o' in 'borrow.' I have heard people try to give it the sound of the 'o' in 'worry.'

She argues that Humpty tries, after the recitation, to \"ground\" the unruly multiplicities of meaning with definitions, but cannot succeed as both the book and the poem are playgrounds for the \"carnivalised aspect of language\". Parsons suggests that this is mirrored in the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of the poem: in the tussle between the [[tetrameter]] in the first three lines of each stanza and [[trimeter]] in the last lines, such that one undercuts the other and we are left off balance, like the poem's hero.<ref name=\"Parsons\"/>\n\nCarroll wrote many poem parodies such as \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat|Twinkle, twinkle little bat]]\", \"[[You Are Old, Father William]]\" and \"[[How Doth the Little Crocodile]]?\" Some have become generally better known than the originals on which they are based, and this is certainly the case with \"Jabberwocky\".<ref Name=\"Lucas\"/> The poems' successes do not rely on any recognition or association of the poems that they parody. Lucas suggests that the original poems provide a strong container but Carroll's works are famous precisely because of their random, surreal quality.<ref Name=\"Lucas\"/> Carroll's grave playfulness has been compared with that of the poet [[Edward Lear]]; there are also parallels with the work of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] in the frequent use of soundplay, [[alliteration]], created-language and [[portmanteau]].

Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, \"'Twas brillig\" becomes \"Il brilgue\". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's [[lexicon]], but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. [[Douglas Hofstadter]] noted in his essay \"Translations of Jabberwocky\", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks \"what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? \".<ref name=\"Hofstadter\"/>\n\nHofstadter also notes that it makes a great difference whether the poem is translated in isolation or as part of a translation of the novel. In the latter case the translator must, through Humpty Dumpty, supply explanations of the invented words. But, he suggests, \"even in this pathologically difficult case of translation, there seems to be some rough equivalence obtainable, a kind of rough [[Isomorphism (sociology)|isomorphism]], partly global, partly local, between the brains of all the readers\".<ref name=\"Hofstadter\">{{cite book | first = Douglas R. | last = Hofstadter | year = 1980 | title = G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid | chapter = Translations of Jabberwocky | chapterurl = http://www76.pair.com/keithlim/jabberwocky/poem/hofstadter.html| isbn = 0-394-74502-7 | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York, NY}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, D.G.

It was designed as verse showing how not to write verse, but eventually became the subject of pedestrian translation or explanation and incorporated into classroom learning.<ref>Green, Roger Lancelyn (1970) ''The Lewis Carroll Handbook'', \"Jabberwocky, and other parodies\" : Dawson of Pall Mall, London</ref> It has also been interpreted as a parody of contemporary Oxford scholarship and specifically the story of how [[Benjamin Jowett]], the notoriously agnostic Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]], came to sign the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'', as an Anglican statement of faith, to save his job.<ref>Prickett, Stephen (2005) ''Victorian Fantasy'' Baylor University Press p113 {{ISBN|1-932792-30-9}}</ref> The transformation of audience perception from satire to seriousness was in a large part predicted by [[G. K. Chesterton]], who wrote in 1932, \"Poor, poor, little Alice! She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others.\"<ref>[[G. K.

Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1871]]\nA decade before the publication of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and the sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', Carroll wrote the first stanza to what would become \"Jabberwocky\" while in [[Croft on Tees]], close to [[Darlington]], where he lived as a child. <!-- we need to check this source b/c he lived in Daresbury - unless they moved to Darlington which is confusing. --> It was printed in 1855 in ''[[Mischmasch]]'', a periodical he wrote and illustrated for the amusement of his family. The piece was titled \"Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" and read:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTwas bryllyg, and ''y<sup>e</sup>'' slythy toves\nDid gyre and gymble in ''y<sup>e</sup>'' wabe:\nAll mimsy were ''y<sup>e</sup>'' borogoves;\nAnd ''y<sup>e</sup>'' mome raths outgrabe.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nCarroll wrote the letter-combination ''y<sup>e</sup>'' throughout the poem for the word ''the'' in order to approximate the [[Middle English|Middle]] and [[Early Modern English]] scribal abbreviation [[Image:EME ye.svg|EME ye.svg]] - a variant of the letter [[Thorn (letter)#Middle and Early Modern English|\u00de (thorn)]] in combination with the superscript E.

The story may have been partly inspired by the local Sunderland area legend of the [[Lambton Worm]],<ref>''A Town Like Alice's'' (1997) Michael Bute Heritage Publications, Sunderland</ref><ref>''Alice in Sunderland'' (2007) Brian Talbot Dark Horse publications.</ref> and the tale of the [[Sockburn Worm]] while writing in [[Croft on Tees]] and [[Whitburn, South Tyneside|Whitburn]] in [[Sockburn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/CroftLewisCarroll.html|title=Vikings and the Jabberwock: Croft, Sockburn and Sadberge|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll, who would have known of [[chapbooks]] such as ''[[The World Turned Upside Down]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-world-turned-upside-down-18th-century/ |title=The World Turned Upside Down (18th century) |publisher=The Public Domain Review |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref> and stories such as \"[[Samuel Foote|The Great Panjandrum]]\".

The illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the contemporary Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of [[palaeontology]] and geology. Stephen Prickett notes that in the context of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Gideon Mantell|Mantell's]] publications and vast exhibitions of dinosaurs, [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|such as those at the Crystal Palace]] from 1854, it is unsurprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock \"the leathery wings of a [[Pterosaur|pterodactyl]] and the long scaly neck and tail of a [[sauropod]].\"<ref Name=\"Prickett\">Prickett, Stephen (2005) ''Victorian Fantasy'' Baylor University Press p80 {{ISBN|1-932792-30-9}}</ref>\n\n==Lexicon==\n{{Quote box |align=right |\n |quote  =<poem>\n\"'''Jabberwocky'''\"\n\n\u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\n\u201cBeware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!\u201d\n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the manxome foe he sought\u2014\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\nAnd as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\n\nOne, two!

When [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions:\n\n<blockquote>\"It seems very pretty,\" she said when she had finished it, \"but it's rather hard to understand!\" (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) \"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas\u2014only I don't exactly know what they are!

In later writings he discussed some of his lexicon, commenting that he did not know the specific meanings or sources of some of the words; the linguistic ambiguity and uncertainty throughout both the book and the poem may largely be the point.<ref name=\"Parsons\"/>\n\nIn ''Through the Looking-Glass'', the character of [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], in response to Alice's request, explains to her the non-sense words from the first stanza of the poem; however, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. For example, following the poem, a \"rath\" is described by Humpty as \"a sort of green pig\".<ref name=\"AAW96\"/> Carroll's notes for the original in ''[[Mischmasch]]'' suggest a \"rath\" is \"a species of Badger\" that \"lived chiefly on cheese\" and had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> The appendices to certain ''Looking Glass'' editions, however, state that the creature is \"a species of land turtle\" that lived on swallows and oysters.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> Later critics added their own interpretations of the lexicon, often without reference to Carroll's own contextual commentary. An extended analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book ''[[The Annotated Alice]]'' by [[Martin Gardner]].\n\nIn 1868 Carroll asked his publishers, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], \"Have you any means, or can you find any, for printing a page or two in the next volume of Alice in reverse?\" It may be that Carroll was wanting to print the whole poem in mirror writing. Macmillan responded that it would cost a great deal more to do, and this may have dissuaded him.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/>\n\nIn the author's note to the Christmas 1896 edition of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' Carroll writes, \"The new words, in the poem Jabberwocky, have given rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronunciation, so it may be well to give instructions on ''that'' point also. Pronounce 'slithy' as if it were the two words, 'sly, thee': make the 'g' ''hard'' in 'gyre' and 'gimble': and pronounce 'rath' to rhyme with 'bath.'\"<ref>Carroll, Lewis (2005) ''Through the Looking Glass''. Hayes Barton Press p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the Preface to ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', Carroll wrote, \"[Let] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce 'slithy toves.' The 'i' in 'slithy' is long, as in 'writhe', and 'toves' is pronounced so as to rhyme with 'groves.' Again, the first \"o\" in \"borogoves\" is pronounced like the 'o' in 'borrow.'

In the 2010 film version of [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|''Alice in Wonderland'']] it is shown with large back legs, small dinosaur-like front legs, and on the ground it uses its wings as front legs like a [[pterosaur]], and it breathes out lightning flashes rather than flame.\n* [[Jubjub bird]]: 'A desperate bird that lives in perpetual passion', according to the Butcher in Carroll's later poem ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''.<ref name=\"HoS\"/> 'Jub' is an ancient word for a [[Jerkin (garment)|jerkin]] or a dialect word for the trot of a horse (OED). It might make reference to the call of the bird resembling the sound \"jub, jub\".<ref name=\"Penguin\"/>\n* Manxome: Possibly 'fearsome'; Possibly a portmanteau of \"manly\" and \"buxom\", the latter relating to men for most of its history; or \"three-legged\" after the [[triskelion]] emblem of the [[Manx people]] from the [[Isle of Man]].\n* [[wikt:mimsy|Mimsy]]: Humpty comments that {{\"'}}Mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"AAW96\"/>\n* Mome: Humpty Dumpty is uncertain about this one: \"I think it's short for 'from home', meaning that they'd lost their way, you know\".  The notes in ''[[Mischmasch]]'' give a different definition of 'grave' (via 'solemome', 'solemone' and 'solemn').\n* Outgrabe: Humpty says {{\"'}}outgribing' is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle\".<ref name=\"AAW96\"/> Carroll's book appendices suggest it is the past tense of the verb to 'outgribe', connected with the old verb to 'grike' or 'shrike', which derived 'shriek' and 'creak' and hence 'squeak'.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/>\n* Rath: Humpty Dumpty says following the poem: \"A 'rath' is a sort of green pig\".  Carroll's notes for the original in  ''[[Mischmasch]]'' state that a 'Rath' is \"a species of land turtle. Head erect, mouth like a shark, the front forelegs curved out so that the animal walked on its knees, smooth green body, lived on swallows and oysters.\"<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> In the [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|1951 animated film adaptation of the previous book]], the raths are depicted as small, multi-coloured creatures with tufty hair, round eyes, and long legs resembling pipe stems.\n* [[wikt:slithy|Slithy]]: Humpty Dumpty says: {{\"'}}Slithy' means 'lithe and slimy'. 'Lithe' is the same as 'active'. You see it's like a portmanteau, there are two meanings packed up into one word.\"<ref name=\"AAW96\"/> The original in ''Mischmasch'' notes that 'slithy' means \"smooth and active\".<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> The ''i'' is long, as in ''writhe''.\n* [[wikt:snicker-snack|Snicker-snack]]: possibly related to the large knife, the [[wikt:snickersnee|snickersnee]].<ref name=\"ExplanatoryN\"/>\n* Tove: Humpty Dumpty says {{\"'}}Toves' are something like badgers, they're something like lizards, and they're something like corkscrews. ... Also they make their nests under sun-dials, also they live on cheese.\"<ref name=\"AAW96\"/> Pronounced so as to rhyme with ''groves''.<ref name=\"HoS\"/> They \"gyre and gimble\", i.e., rotate and bore. Toves are described slightly differently in ''[[Mischmasch]]'': \"a species of Badger [which] had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag [and] lived chiefly on cheese\".<ref name=\"Penguin\"/>\n* [[wikt:tulgey|Tulgey]]: Carroll himself said he could give no source for this word. It could be taken to mean thick, dense, dark. It has been suggested that it comes from the [[Anglo-Cornish]] word ''tulgu'', 'darkness', which in turn comes from the [[Cornish language]] ''tewolgow'' 'darkness, gloominess'.<ref>George, Ken. ''An Gerlyver Meur, Cornish-English, English-Cornish Dictionary''. Cornish Language Board, 2009.

Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1871]]\nThough the poem contains many nonsensical words, English [[syntax]] and poetic forms are observed, such as the [[quatrain]] verses, the general [[Rhyme scheme|ABAB rhyme scheme]] and the [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] [[Meter (poetry)|meter]].<ref>Gross and McDowell (1996). ''Sound and form in modern poetry'', p. 15. The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-06517-3}}</ref> Linguist Peter Lucas believes the \"nonsense\" term is inaccurate. The poem relies on a distortion of sense rather than \"non-sense\", allowing the reader to infer meaning and therefore engage with narrative while lexical allusions swim under the surface of the poem.<ref Name=\"Lucas\"/><ref>For a full linguistic and phonetic analysis of the poem see the article \"Jabberwocky back to Old English: Nonsense, Anglo-Saxon and Oxford\" by Lucas, Peter J. in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling'', pp. 503\u2013520. 1997. {{ISBN|3-11-014504-9}}</ref>\n\nMarnie Parsons describes the work as a \"[[semiotic]] catastrophe\", arguing that the words create a discernible narrative within the structure of the poem, though the reader cannot know what they symbolise. She argues that Humpty tries, after the recitation, to \"ground\" the unruly multiplicities of meaning with definitions, but cannot succeed as both the book and the poem are playgrounds for the \"carnivalised aspect of language\". Parsons suggests that this is mirrored in the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of the poem: in the tussle between the [[tetrameter]] in the first three lines of each stanza and [[trimeter]] in the last lines, such that one undercuts the other and we are left off balance, like the poem's hero.<ref name=\"Parsons\"/>\n\nCarroll wrote many poem parodies such as \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat|Twinkle, twinkle little bat]]\", \"[[You Are Old, Father William]]\" and \"[[How Doth the Little Crocodile]]?\" Some have become generally better known than the originals on which they are based, and this is certainly the case with \"Jabberwocky\".<ref Name=\"Lucas\"/> The poems' successes do not rely on any recognition or association of the poems that they parody. Lucas suggests that the original poems provide a strong container but Carroll's works are famous precisely because of their random, surreal quality.<ref Name=\"Lucas\"/> Carroll's grave playfulness has been compared with that of the poet [[Edward Lear]]; there are also parallels with the work of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] in the frequent use of soundplay, [[alliteration]], created-language and [[portmanteau]].

Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, \"'Twas brillig\" becomes \"Il brilgue\". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's [[lexicon]], but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. [[Douglas Hofstadter]] noted in his essay \"Translations of Jabberwocky\", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks \"what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? \".<ref name=\"Hofstadter\"/>\n\nHofstadter also notes that it makes a great difference whether the poem is translated in isolation or as part of a translation of the novel. In the latter case the translator must, through Humpty Dumpty, supply explanations of the invented words. But, he suggests, \"even in this pathologically difficult case of translation, there seems to be some rough equivalence obtainable, a kind of rough [[Isomorphism (sociology)|isomorphism]], partly global, partly local, between the brains of all the readers\".<ref name=\"Hofstadter\">{{cite book | first = Douglas R. | last = Hofstadter | year = 1980 | title = G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid | chapter = Translations of Jabberwocky | chapterurl = http://www76.pair.com/keithlim/jabberwocky/poem/hofstadter.html| isbn = 0-394-74502-7 | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York, NY}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, D.G.

It was designed as verse showing how not to write verse, but eventually became the subject of pedestrian translation or explanation and incorporated into classroom learning.<ref>Green, Roger Lancelyn (1970) ''The Lewis Carroll Handbook'', \"Jabberwocky, and other parodies\" : Dawson of Pall Mall, London</ref> It has also been interpreted as a parody of contemporary Oxford scholarship and specifically the story of how [[Benjamin Jowett]], the notoriously agnostic Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]], came to sign the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'', as an Anglican statement of faith, to save his job.<ref>Prickett, Stephen (2005) ''Victorian Fantasy'' Baylor University Press p113 {{ISBN|1-932792-30-9}}</ref> The transformation of audience perception from satire to seriousness was in a large part predicted by [[G. K. Chesterton]], who wrote in 1932, \"Poor, poor, little Alice! She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others.\"<ref>[[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton, G. K]] (1953) \"Lewis Carroll\" in ''A Handful of Authors'', ed.

An optional [[hardtop]] was made available at the same time, in [[sheet moulding compound]] (SMC). Demand initially outstripped production, fueled by enthusiastic press reviews.\n\nIn Japan, the car was not badged as a Mazda, as the company was experimenting with the creation of different [[marque]]s for deluxe models, similar to [[Nissan]]'s [[Infiniti]], [[Honda]]'s [[Acura]] and [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus]]. Instead, the Mazda MX-5 was sold as the '''[[Eunos (automobile)|Eunos]] Roadster''' in Japan, and was joined by the [[Mazda MX-3|MX-3/AZ-3/Eunos Presso]] (based on Japanese Mazda dealerships). The exterior dimensions and the engine displacement were also in compliance with Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|compact car regulation]].\n\n[[File:1990 Mazda MX-5 (NA) hardtop (2015-07-24).jpg|thumbnail|left|Mazda MX-5 with hardtop (Australia)]]\n\nThe body shell of the NA was all-steel with a lightweight aluminum [[hood (vehicle)|hood]].

Without options, the NA weighed only {{convert|980|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It had a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.38}}. Suspension was an independent double wishbone on all four wheels, with an [[anti-roll bar]] at the front and rear. Four-wheel disc brakes, ventilated at the front, were behind alloy wheels with 185/60HR14 [[radial tire]]s. The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then-current 323/Protege.\n\n[[File:1990 mazda mx5 1.6 DOHC 4 cylinder turbo.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Mazda MX-5 1600cc DOHC 4-cylinder engine.

The Japanese and American markets also received an optional viscous [[limited-slip differential]], although it was only available for cars with a manual transmission. To achieve the low introductory price, the base model was stripped. It had steel wheels, manual steering, roll-up windows, and no stereo or air-conditioning.

This model featured red leather interior, upgraded stereo, Nardi shift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, limited-slip differential, power windows, power mirrors, power steering, air conditioning, BBS wheels, [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein shocks]], front and rear [[spoiler (car)|spoiler]]s, ABS brakes, stainless sill plates, and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim. All 1993 LE cars came in black.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, the first-generation MX-5 was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful {{convert|1839|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Mazda B engine#BP|BP-ZE]]'' engine, dual [[airbag]]s placed in a redesigned dashboard, the addition of a Mazda badge on the front fascia in the US and a limited-slip differential in some markets. The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side-impact standards, most visibly by adding a \"track bar\" between the seatbelt towers inside the car, but also to the front and rear subframes. Also, 1994&nbsp;and 1995&nbsp;were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint (Laguna Blue Mica), making these cars rare collectors cars to some. 1994 also saw the introduction of the \"R\" package, a sport-themed package with Bilstein shocks, stiffer sway bars, retuned springs, subtle front and rear underbody spoilers, and a [[Torsen]] LSD. Air conditioning was optional, but the \"R\" package was not available with power steering, leather, or an automatic transmission. It can also be identified by a red Miata badge on the rear instead of the usual black. No body style changes were made, however. Halfway through the 1997 model year the hazard light button was changed to a black button with red symbol as opposed to the earlier red button with white symbol.\n\nThe new {{convert|1839|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine produced {{convert|96|kW|bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|149|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 5,500 rpm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1994/1666505/mazda_mx-5_miata.html|title=1994 Mazda MX-5 Miata|website=Automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>, which was then increased to {{convert|99|kW|bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|155|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,500 rpm for the 1996 model year <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1997/1640990/mazda_mx-5_miata.html|title=1997 Mazda MX-5 Miata|website=Automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>. The base weight increased to {{convert|990|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Performance was thus improved slightly, because the additional weight was more than offset by the extra power. In some markets such as Europe, the {{convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on}} engine continued to be available as a lower-cost option, but was detuned to {{convert|66|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}. This lower-powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}}. Japanese and U.S. models offered an optional Torsen LSD, which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential.\n\n[[File:red-na-nb.JPG|thumb|left|The retractable headlamps of the NA (front car) were replaced by fixed headlamps on the NB (rear car).]]\n\nThere were a number of trim levels and special editions available, determined by local Mazda marketing departments. In the US, the base model was offered for [[United States dollar|US$]]13,995 at launch and was very basic, with manual windows, steel wheels, and without air conditioning or power steering. The \"A Package\" offered power steering, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum alloy wheels and cassette stereo. The \"B Package\" added power windows, along with cruise control and headrest speakers, while the \"C Package\" included a tan interior and top and leather seats. The \"R Package\" was for racing, and the annual special editions were formalized as \"M Editions\". These included all of the luxury options from the \"C Package\" as well as special paint and, sometimes, special wheels. In the UK, to celebrate [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans|Mazda's 24 hours of Le Mans win]], Mazda brought out a special edition of the MX-5, with the winner's color scheme (see [[Mazda 787B]]) and came equipped with BBR (Brodie Brittain Racing) turbo conversion; the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of the MX-5s.\n\nThe first generation MX-5 was phased out after the 1997 model year (with the exception of 400 limited edition Berkeley models sold only in the UK in 1999 to mark the end of the NA), with the final 1,500 NAs produced for the US market being the \"STO\" (\"Special Touring Option\") versions.\n\n==Special editions==\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1992-1993 Mazda MX-5 (NA) roadster (2011-11-18) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1992-1993 Mazda MX-5 (NA) roadster (2011-11-18) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Mazda MX-5 (Australia)\n}}\n\n;1991 Special Edition\nLimited to 3,997 units, this edition of the MX-5 NA was offered only in [[British racing green]] with tan leather interior and tonneau cover and featured a wooden [[Nardi (carmaker)|Nardi]] shift knob and handbrake lever, stainless steel door sills, air conditioning, CD player, cruise control, and headrest speakers.<ref name=\"Special Editions\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-every-special-edition-mazda-miata-ever-so-1675339097 |title=Your Guide To Every Special Edition Mazda Miata Ever Sold In America |first=Travis |last=Okulski |website=Jalopnik |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date=2015-01-30 |access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>\n\n;1992 Sunburst\nA US$250 option for the exclusive Sunburst Yellow color, limited to 1,519 units.<ref name=\"Special Editions\"/>\n\n;1992 Black Miata\nLimited to 4,625 units, this edition was offered only in Brilliant Black with tan leather interior, Nardi shift knob and handbrake lever and special 14-inch BBS wheels.<ref name=\"Special Editions\"/>\n\n;1993 Limited Edition\nLimited to 1,505 units, this Limited Edition model was equipped similarly to the 1992 Black Miata, but with red leather interior, sport suspension, front and rear spoilers, rear skirt, air conditioning, headrest speakers and 14-inch BBS wheels.<ref name=\"Special Editions\"/>\n\n;1993 Energia Electric Vehicle\nIn 1993, Mazda partnered with the [[Chugoku Electric Power Company]] to produce an [[Electric car|electric]] prototype called the \"Energia Electric Vehicle.\" The prototype had a top speed of {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a range of {{convert|180|km|mile|abbr=on}}.

Founded in November 1991, M2, also known as \"Mazda Too\", was Mazda's new off-line planning / niche-house / Research & Development company back in the early '90s. The M2 Corp. employees had noble intentions \u2014 creating niche-mobiles derived from Mazda's volume products. Although M2's basic mission involved focusing on the \"soft\" aspects of vehicle design in an attempt to create more specifically targeted niche variants, the changes to the off-line cars would go well beyond mere cosmetics.\n\nHeading the M2 operation was Mr. Masakatsu Kato, original father of the Miata (Eunos Roadster) in Japan, as well as creator of several Mazda concept vehicles. Kato-san was assisted by Hirotaka Tachibana, development engineer responsible for the superb dynamics of the Mazda FC (second generation RX-7) and the NA Roadster. M2 Corp. was based out of Tokyo, Japan. M2-Corp was a 100% owned subsidiary of Mazda, and it was closed by Mazda in 1995. Mazda kept a similar program going with the Mazdaspeed vehicles, and then in the late '90s Mazdaspeed was absorbed into Mazda as a subsidiary company in Mazda Auto Tokyo. There were many types of M2 branded vehicles between 1991 and 1995, beginning with the 1001 up to the 1031 Cafe Racer (Dec-91).\n\n;M2-1001 Cafe Roadster (Limited 1/300)\nM2 Corp. released the M2-1001 Roadster in December 1991. It was a special \"Limited Production\" Roadster variant that was a short production run of only 300 units, in a special Blue/Black Mica Paint, with a sticker price of $26,000. Prospective buyers were required to show up in person at M2's Tokyo headquarters to register for a lottery to place an order for this extremely limited Roadster.\n\nThis upscale Roadster was M2's first turn-key, race-ready offering. A list of popular features, while not exhaustive, is as follows: functional front [[Spoiler (automotive)|airdam]] with integrated fog lamps, vintage aero mirrors, 4-point roll bar, vintage gauge cluster, fixed back bucket seats, polished 3-spoke steering wheel, stiffer suspension package with M2 specific rates, polished aluminum strut brace, upgraded exhaust by [[HKS (company)|HKS]], intake system, 1.6 L motor with new aggressive pistons, upgraded camshaft, lightweight flywheel, LSD cooling intake, manual steering, manual windows (A/C was optional), racing pedals, centerless console with matching shortened radio bezel, aluminum gas filler cap, a more aggressive wheel & tire package (15- x 6-inch Panasport rims), and a rear spoiler (which became standard for the R package). The performance changes made to the Roadster would bump the power to {{convert|98|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} at 7,000&nbsp;rpm, and {{convert|148|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,500&nbsp;rpm. Once released, it proved so popular that people were paying up to $35,000 for one.\n\n;M2-1002 Vintage Roadster (Limited 1/300)\nM2 Corp. released its second Roadster in November 1992, with a slightly different front bumper but all the same items as the previous 1001 Roadster. This one did not do as well as the 1001.\n\n;M2-1028 Street Competition Roadster (Limited 1/300)\nM2-Corp released its third Roadster in February 1994, based on the original \"Jinba Ittai\" concept made by Toshihiko Hirai. This was billed as a track-ready Roadster. (The US saw a cheaper version known as the R-Package.) Offered in Chaste White or Brilliant Black only, this Roadster used the new 1.8 L powerplant with upgraded pistons, camshafts, and other similar goodies as the previous 1001 and 1002. This Roadster had an output of close to {{convert|110|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}, and included 14-inch Eunos Factory Rims with a unique gunmetal paint with polished lip. The only real changes were a new set of lightweight side mirrors, [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] Steering Wheel, centerless console, racing seats, racing tow hook,  a set of lower lip spoilers (R-Package), and a newly designed \"Duck-Tail\" trunk lid with integrated spoiler. The M2-1028 trunk lid was made from aluminum and weighed only {{convert|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, a very light weight from the original lid of {{convert|7.0|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It also came with a 6-point roll cage, but no soft-top, instead featuring a tarp that stretched over the cage. With optional FRP Hardtop with [[plexiglass]] rear window for more weight savings coming in at only {{convert|8.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Turbo conversions ==\nBrodie Britain Racing (BBR) of [[Brackley]], England, have had a long history of involvement with NA models in the UK, having supplied parts and equipment for a dealer supplied BBR Turbo version of the car between 1990 and 1991. This raised power output to {{convert|110|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}, and produced {{convert|209|Nm|ftlb|abbr=on}} of torque. The kit consisted of 68 parts and was covered by a full dealer warranty. They were supplied and fitted to around 750 UK spec cars, including for the 1991 'Le Mans' special edition, with a further 150 kits being supplied overseas.<ref name=Liz_Turner>''You and Your MX5/Miata'', Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85960-847-7}}.</ref> Two decades later in 2011, BBR now offer a turn-key refurbishment package for old NA MX-5's, again including a turbo charger kit. This now increases power output to {{convert|160|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}, and produces {{convert|237|Nm|ftlb|abbr=on}} of torque. The estimated top speed is now {{convert|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with 0\u201397 (60 mph) approached in 5.5 seconds. The turbo charger used is a [[Garrett AiResearch]] GT25 ball bearing unit, and the package also includes an air-to-air intercooler, and a digital piggy-back ECU to control timing, fueling, and boost pressures. Subject to a satisfactory donor car, the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment, a paint respray, new seats, wheels, and other trim. As of January 2011 the cost for a 'refreshed' BBR MX-5 Turbo is \u00a37,500.<ref name=\"EVO\">EVO magazine, Issue 153, February 2011, pages 88\u201391</ref>\n\nIn the United States, NA (and later model) turbo conversions are available from companies like Flyin' Miata. The conversions use mainly Garrett turbochargers (GT2560R) and are available as a kit or fully installed. Flyin' Miata also offers a [[California Air Resources Board|CARB]]-legal kit as well.\n\n==Factory restoration program==\n[[File:Osaka Auto Messe 2018 (181) - the white body of Eunos ROADSTER (E-NA6CE).jpg|thumb|right|The MX-5 NA's unibody on display at the 2018 [[Osaka Auto Messe]].]]\nIn 2018, Mazda began a factory restoration program for Eunos Roadster owners in Japan.

An optional [[hardtop]] was made available at the same time, in [[sheet moulding compound]] (SMC). Demand initially outstripped production, fueled by enthusiastic press reviews.\n\nIn Japan, the car was not badged as a Mazda, as the company was experimenting with the creation of different [[marque]]s for deluxe models, similar to [[Nissan]]'s [[Infiniti]], [[Honda]]'s [[Acura]] and [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus]]. Instead, the Mazda MX-5 was sold as the '''[[Eunos (automobile)|Eunos]] Roadster''' in Japan, and was joined by the [[Mazda MX-3|MX-3/AZ-3/Eunos Presso]] (based on Japanese Mazda dealerships). The exterior dimensions and the engine displacement were also in compliance with Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|compact car regulation]].\n\n[[File:1990 Mazda MX-5 (NA) hardtop (2015-07-24).jpg|thumbnail|left|Mazda MX-5 with hardtop (Australia)]]\n\nThe body shell of the NA was all-steel with a lightweight aluminum [[hood (vehicle)|hood]].

Without options, the NA weighed only {{convert|980|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It had a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.38}}. Suspension was an independent double wishbone on all four wheels, with an [[anti-roll bar]] at the front and rear. Four-wheel disc brakes, ventilated at the front, were behind alloy wheels with 185/60HR14 [[radial tire]]s. The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then-current 323/Protege.\n\n[[File:1990 mazda mx5 1.6 DOHC 4 cylinder turbo.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Mazda MX-5 1600cc DOHC 4-cylinder engine.

This model featured red leather interior, upgraded stereo, Nardi shift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, limited-slip differential, power windows, power mirrors, power steering, air conditioning, BBS wheels, [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein shocks]], front and rear [[spoiler (car)|spoiler]]s, ABS brakes, stainless sill plates, and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim. All 1993 LE cars came in black.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, the first-generation MX-5 was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful {{convert|1839|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Mazda B engine#BP|BP-ZE]]'' engine, dual [[airbag]]s placed in a redesigned dashboard, the addition of a Mazda badge on the front fascia in the US and a limited-slip differential in some markets. The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side-impact standards, most visibly by adding a \"track bar\" between the seatbelt towers inside the car, but also to the front and rear subframes. Also, 1994&nbsp;and 1995&nbsp;were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint (Laguna Blue Mica), making these cars rare collectors cars to some. 1994 also saw the introduction of the \"R\" package, a sport-themed package with Bilstein shocks, stiffer sway bars, retuned springs, subtle front and rear underbody spoilers, and a [[Torsen]] LSD. Air conditioning was optional, but the \"R\" package was not available with power steering, leather, or an automatic transmission. It can also be identified by a red Miata badge on the rear instead of the usual black. No body style changes were made, however. Halfway through the 1997 model year the hazard light button was changed to a black button with red symbol as opposed to the earlier red button with white symbol.\n\nThe new {{convert|1839|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine produced {{convert|96|kW|bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|149|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 5,500 rpm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1994/1666505/mazda_mx-5_miata.html|title=1994 Mazda MX-5 Miata|website=Automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>, which was then increased to {{convert|99|kW|bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|155|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,500 rpm for the 1996 model year <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1997/1640990/mazda_mx-5_miata.html|title=1997 Mazda MX-5 Miata|website=Automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>. The base weight increased to {{convert|990|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Performance was thus improved slightly, because the additional weight was more than offset by the extra power. In some markets such as Europe, the {{convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on}} engine continued to be available as a lower-cost option, but was detuned to {{convert|66|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}. This lower-powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}}. Japanese and U.S. models offered an optional Torsen LSD, which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential.\n\n[[File:red-na-nb.JPG|thumb|left|The retractable headlamps of the NA (front car) were replaced by fixed headlamps on the NB (rear car).]]\n\nThere were a number of trim levels and special editions available, determined by local Mazda marketing departments. In the US, the base model was offered for [[United States dollar|US$]]13,995 at launch and was very basic, with manual windows, steel wheels, and without air conditioning or power steering. The \"A Package\" offered power steering, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum alloy wheels and cassette stereo. The \"B Package\" added power windows, along with cruise control and headrest speakers, while the \"C Package\" included a tan interior and top and leather seats. The \"R Package\" was for racing, and the annual special editions were formalized as \"M Editions\". These included all of the luxury options from the \"C Package\" as well as special paint and, sometimes, special wheels. In the UK, to celebrate [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans|Mazda's 24 hours of Le Mans win]], Mazda brought out a special edition of the MX-5, with the winner's color scheme (see [[Mazda 787B]]) and came equipped with BBR (Brodie Brittain Racing) turbo conversion; the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of the MX-5s.\n\nThe first generation MX-5 was phased out after the 1997 model year (with the exception of 400 limited edition Berkeley models sold only in the UK in 1999 to mark the end of the NA), with the final 1,500 NAs produced for the US market being the \"STO\" (\"Special Touring Option\") versions.\n\n==Special editions==\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1992-1993 Mazda MX-5 (NA) roadster (2011-11-18) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1992-1993 Mazda MX-5 (NA) roadster (2011-11-18) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Mazda MX-5 (Australia)\n}}\n\n;1991 Special Edition\nLimited to 3,997 units, this edition of the MX-5 NA was offered only in [[British racing green]] with tan leather interior and tonneau cover and featured a wooden [[Nardi (carmaker)|Nardi]] shift knob and handbrake lever, stainless steel door sills, air conditioning, CD player, cruise control, and headrest speakers.<ref name=\"Special Editions\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-every-special-edition-mazda-miata-ever-so-1675339097 |title=Your Guide To Every Special Edition Mazda Miata Ever Sold In America |first=Travis |last=Okulski |website=Jalopnik |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date=2015-01-30 |access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>\n\n;1992 Sunburst\nA US$250 option for the exclusive Sunburst Yellow color, limited to 1,519 units.<ref name=\"Special Editions\"/>\n\n;1992 Black Miata\nLimited to 4,625 units, this edition was offered only in Brilliant Black with tan leather interior, Nardi shift knob and handbrake lever and special 14-inch BBS wheels.<ref name=\"Special Editions\"/>\n\n;1993 Limited Edition\nLimited to 1,505 units, this Limited Edition model was equipped similarly to the 1992 Black Miata, but with red leather interior, sport suspension, front and rear spoilers, rear skirt, air conditioning, headrest speakers and 14-inch BBS wheels.<ref name=\"Special Editions\"/>\n\n;1993 Energia Electric Vehicle\nIn 1993, Mazda partnered with the [[Chugoku Electric Power Company]] to produce an [[Electric car|electric]] prototype called the \"Energia Electric Vehicle.\" The prototype had a top speed of {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a range of {{convert|180|km|mile|abbr=on}}.

Founded in November 1991, M2, also known as \"Mazda Too\", was Mazda's new off-line planning / niche-house / Research & Development company back in the early '90s. The M2 Corp. employees had noble intentions \u2014 creating niche-mobiles derived from Mazda's volume products. Although M2's basic mission involved focusing on the \"soft\" aspects of vehicle design in an attempt to create more specifically targeted niche variants, the changes to the off-line cars would go well beyond mere cosmetics.\n\nHeading the M2 operation was Mr. Masakatsu Kato, original father of the Miata (Eunos Roadster) in Japan, as well as creator of several Mazda concept vehicles. Kato-san was assisted by Hirotaka Tachibana, development engineer responsible for the superb dynamics of the Mazda FC (second generation RX-7) and the NA Roadster. M2 Corp. was based out of Tokyo, Japan. M2-Corp was a 100% owned subsidiary of Mazda, and it was closed by Mazda in 1995. Mazda kept a similar program going with the Mazdaspeed vehicles, and then in the late '90s Mazdaspeed was absorbed into Mazda as a subsidiary company in Mazda Auto Tokyo. There were many types of M2 branded vehicles between 1991 and 1995, beginning with the 1001 up to the 1031 Cafe Racer (Dec-91).\n\n;M2-1001 Cafe Roadster (Limited 1/300)\nM2 Corp. released the M2-1001 Roadster in December 1991. It was a special \"Limited Production\" Roadster variant that was a short production run of only 300 units, in a special Blue/Black Mica Paint, with a sticker price of $26,000. Prospective buyers were required to show up in person at M2's Tokyo headquarters to register for a lottery to place an order for this extremely limited Roadster.\n\nThis upscale Roadster was M2's first turn-key, race-ready offering. A list of popular features, while not exhaustive, is as follows: functional front [[Spoiler (automotive)|airdam]] with integrated fog lamps, vintage aero mirrors, 4-point roll bar, vintage gauge cluster, fixed back bucket seats, polished 3-spoke steering wheel, stiffer suspension package with M2 specific rates, polished aluminum strut brace, upgraded exhaust by [[HKS (company)|HKS]], intake system, 1.6 L motor with new aggressive pistons, upgraded camshaft, lightweight flywheel, LSD cooling intake, manual steering, manual windows (A/C was optional), racing pedals, centerless console with matching shortened radio bezel, aluminum gas filler cap, a more aggressive wheel & tire package (15- x 6-inch Panasport rims), and a rear spoiler (which became standard for the R package). The performance changes made to the Roadster would bump the power to {{convert|98|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} at 7,000&nbsp;rpm, and {{convert|148|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,500&nbsp;rpm. Once released, it proved so popular that people were paying up to $35,000 for one.\n\n;M2-1002 Vintage Roadster (Limited 1/300)\nM2 Corp. released its second Roadster in November 1992, with a slightly different front bumper but all the same items as the previous 1001 Roadster. This one did not do as well as the 1001.\n\n;M2-1028 Street Competition Roadster (Limited 1/300)\nM2-Corp released its third Roadster in February 1994, based on the original \"Jinba Ittai\" concept made by Toshihiko Hirai. This was billed as a track-ready Roadster. (The US saw a cheaper version known as the R-Package.) Offered in Chaste White or Brilliant Black only, this Roadster used the new 1.8 L powerplant with upgraded pistons, camshafts, and other similar goodies as the previous 1001 and 1002. This Roadster had an output of close to {{convert|110|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}, and included 14-inch Eunos Factory Rims with a unique gunmetal paint with polished lip. The only real changes were a new set of lightweight side mirrors, [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] Steering Wheel, centerless console, racing seats, racing tow hook,  a set of lower lip spoilers (R-Package), and a newly designed \"Duck-Tail\" trunk lid with integrated spoiler. The M2-1028 trunk lid was made from aluminum and weighed only {{convert|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, a very light weight from the original lid of {{convert|7.0|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It also came with a 6-point roll cage, but no soft-top, instead featuring a tarp that stretched over the cage. With optional FRP Hardtop with [[plexiglass]] rear window for more weight savings coming in at only {{convert|8.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Turbo conversions ==\nBrodie Britain Racing (BBR) of [[Brackley]], England, have had a long history of involvement with NA models in the UK, having supplied parts and equipment for a dealer supplied BBR Turbo version of the car between 1990 and 1991. This raised power output to {{convert|110|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}, and produced {{convert|209|Nm|ftlb|abbr=on}} of torque. The kit consisted of 68 parts and was covered by a full dealer warranty. They were supplied and fitted to around 750 UK spec cars, including for the 1991 'Le Mans' special edition, with a further 150 kits being supplied overseas.<ref name=Liz_Turner>''You and Your MX5/Miata'', Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85960-847-7}}.</ref> Two decades later in 2011, BBR now offer a turn-key refurbishment package for old NA MX-5's, again including a turbo charger kit. This now increases power output to {{convert|160|kW|bhp|abbr=on}}, and produces {{convert|237|Nm|ftlb|abbr=on}} of torque. The estimated top speed is now {{convert|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with 0\u201397 (60 mph) approached in 5.5 seconds. The turbo charger used is a [[Garrett AiResearch]] GT25 ball bearing unit, and the package also includes an air-to-air intercooler, and a digital piggy-back ECU to control timing, fueling, and boost pressures. Subject to a satisfactory donor car, the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment, a paint respray, new seats, wheels, and other trim. As of January 2011 the cost for a 'refreshed' BBR MX-5 Turbo is \u00a37,500.<ref name=\"EVO\">EVO magazine, Issue 153, February 2011, pages 88\u201391</ref>\n\nIn the United States, NA (and later model) turbo conversions are available from companies like Flyin' Miata. The conversions use mainly Garrett turbochargers (GT2560R) and are available as a kit or fully installed. Flyin' Miata also offers a [[California Air Resources Board|CARB]]-legal kit as well.\n\n==Factory restoration program==\n[[File:Osaka Auto Messe 2018 (181) - the white body of Eunos ROADSTER (E-NA6CE).jpg|thumb|right|The MX-5 NA's unibody on display at the 2018 [[Osaka Auto Messe]].]]\nIn 2018, Mazda began a factory restoration program for Eunos Roadster owners in Japan.

The model continued the MX-5's philosophy of being a lightweight, [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout#Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] while featuring numerous performance improvements, however lacking its predecessor's retractable headlamps. The NB is also the only generation to feature a factory-built [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] variant in the form of the [[#Mazdaspeed MX-5 (2004\u20132005)|Mazdaspeed MX-5]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Mazda MX5 rear 20070816.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pre\u2013facelift Mazda MX-5 (NB) convertible (Europe)]]\n\nThe redesigned MX-5 was previewed at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] in October 1997. In February 1998, Mazda released the second-generation MX-5, production code NB, for the 1999 model year. The NB featured a more powerful engine and external styling cues borrowed from the [[Mazda RX-7 (FD)|third generation Mazda RX-7]], designed in 1995 by [[Tom Matano]]. Prices in the United States, the main market for the MX-5, started at [[United States dollar|US$]]19,770.\n\nAlthough many parts of the interior and body were different, the most notable changes were the headlamps: the first generation's [[hidden headlamps|retractable headlamps]] no longer passed [[pedestrian safety through vehicle design|pedestrian safety]] tests and were replaced by fixed ones. The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model and was slightly more aerodynamic than the original, with a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.36}}. Other notable improvements include a glass rear window with defogger for the convertible top and a retractable wind deflector behind the seats.\n\nThe NB continued to employ four-wheel independent suspension, with enlarged anti-roll bars at the front and rear, but the wheels, tires and brakes were significantly upgraded: [[anti-lock braking system]] was offered as an option; alloy wheels were now 14\" (360 mm) or 15\" (380 mm) in diameter and 6\" (150 mm) in width, depending on the trim package; sports models were equipped with the larger wheels and 195/50VR15 tires.\n\nThe [[Mazda B engine#BP-4W|BP-4W]] engine remained at {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}} but received several minor updates. The engine compression ratio was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.5:1 by adding slightly domed pistons. The intake cam was changed to a solid lifter design with a stronger cam; the intake runners in the head were straightened and the intake manifold was mounted higher up. Mazda's [[Variable-length intake manifold|Variable Intake Control System]] was introduced, which effectively gave a long narrow intake manifold at low rpm for better swirl, changing to a short, free-flowing manifold at high rpm for maximum breathing. Power output of the new engine was quoted at {{convert|104.4|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|157|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe {{convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Mazda B engine#B6ZE(RS)|B6]] engine remained available in Europe and Japan. The base-model {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}} NB could reach {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 7.8&nbsp;s and had a top speed of {{convert|210|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n==MX-5 10th Anniversary Model (1999)==\nIn 1999, Mazda celebrated the 10th anniversary of the MX-5 with the '''10th Anniversary Model''', a limited edition featuring some until-then exclusive features, namely a 6-speed [[manual transmission]] and [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]] shock absorbers; 15 inch polished aluminum wheels with 195/50R15 tires and a very desirable [[Torsen]] [[limited-slip differential]].<ref name=\"Special Editions\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-every-special-edition-mazda-miata-ever-so-1675339097 |title=Your Guide To Every Special Edition Mazda Miata Ever Sold In America |first=Travis |last=Okulski |website=[[Jalopnik]] |date=2015-01-30 |access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> Performance figures were slightly different, with quicker acceleration and higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in \"10th Anniversary Edition\"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue [[alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] seats and floor mats, matching 3-spoke Nardi leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, BOSE audio system, bright gauge rings, carbon grained center console panel and stainless steel scuff plates. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0\u2013{{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 7.6 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the standard 5-speed model, according to ''[[Car and Driver]]'', and 0.4 seconds faster according to ''[[Motor Trend]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/mazda-mx-5-miata-10th-anniversary-edition-short-take-road-test |title=Mazda MX-5 Miata 10th-Anniversary Edition \u2013 Short Take Road Test |first=Fred |last=Gregory |magazine=[[Car and Driver]] |date=September 1999 |accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/mazda/112_9906_2000_mazda_miata/ |title=2000 Mazda Miata 10th Anniversary Edition |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |first=Matt |last=Stone |date=June 1999 |accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref> However, in spite of the 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed increased from {{convert|210|to|214|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Combined fuel consumption improved from {{convert|8.5|to|8.0|l/100 km|abbr=on}}.\n\nEach car was sequentially numbered on a badge on the driver-side front quarter panel. A \"Certificate of Authenticity\" with the same number came with each car, signed by Mazda President James E. Miller and dated 10 February 1999. On certain markets, a gift set was also included, consisting of a 1:43 scale diecast model, two [[Seiko]]-branded wristwatches (his and hers) with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo, and metal keychain in the form of the Miata logo, all encased in a luxury blue velvet box.<ref name=Liz_Turner/>\n\nDespite the publicity that Mazda gave to this model, it took more than a year to sell all units, drawing criticism that too many units had been produced (another factor was the high price with an MSRP of $26,875, about $6500 more than a base model).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} 7,500 units of the 10th Anniversary were produced,<ref name=Liz_Turner>''You and Your MX5/Miata'', Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85960-847-7}}.</ref> with 3,700 distributed to Europe (of which: 600 \u2013 UK, 20 \u2013 Portugal), 3,150 to North America (of which 3,000 to US and 150 to Canada), 500 to Japan and 150 to Australia, with car number 7,500 being sold in the UK.\n\nFor comparison, there were 3,500 units of the [[Mazda MX-5 (NC)#Special editions (2005\u20142008)|NC's 3rd Generation Limited]] launch model in 2005, and regular limited editions produced each year do not usually exceed 1,500 units per region. The polished aluminum wheels are notorious for corroding once the thin lacquer coating is damaged. Mazda replaced thousands of sets under warranty.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} There were minor differences in specification according to the market, such as no sports appearance package (front/side/back skirts, rear wing) or air conditioning for Europe.\n\n==Mono-Posto (2000)==\nIntroduced at the [[SEMA#2000|2000 SEMA Show]], the Mono-Posto concept was designed to be a single-seat sports car inspired by the [[Lotus Eleven]] and [[Jaguar D-Type]].<ref name=\"Mono-Posto\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motor1.com/news/267366/mazda-mono-posto-concept-we-forgot/ |title=2000 Mazda Mono-Posto: Concept We Forgot |first=Adrian |last=Padeanu |website=[[Motorsport Network]] |date=2018-09-26 |accessdate=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Facelift (2001)==\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Mazda MX-5 II Facelift 20090630 front.jpg\n| image2 = Mazda MX-5 II Facelift 20090630 rear.jpg\n| caption2 = 2001 facelift\n| image3 = 2002 Mazda MX5 1.8 Sport Black Interior.jpg\n| caption3 = Facelift interior. There are many improvements over the Mk1 Interior, but it still retains the original functional layout and feel\n}}\n\nFor the 2001 model year, a facelift to the second-generation MX-5 was released. There were some minor exterior changes, with a press-release of July 18, 2000, announcing the changes as \"resulting in an even sportier and more forceful look\". Fog lamps, previously an option, were made standard. The headlamps now featured projector style low beams and separate high beam lenses. The rear turn signals lamps were changed from amber to clear to make the car look more modern. Some cockpit elements were changed, the most notable being the redesigned center console, and the instrument panel gauges received a white face and red numbers from the previous black and blue. The seats were also upgraded, incorporating more support in the side bolsters and taller headrests. Added for top models (designated 'Sport' in the U.K) were {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels with 205/45VR16 low-profile tires, larger brakes at the front and rear, additional chassis stiffening braces, a limited-slip differential, a 6-speed manual transmission, Bilstein suspension and leather seats. The upgraded tires and suspension allowed the new model to pull 0.91 g in lateral grip in tests by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine. The body was strengthened, gaining 16% in [[bending|bending rigidity]] and 22% in [[torsion (mechanics)|torsional rigidity]]. With the minimum of options, the 2001 model weighed {{convert|1065|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2002 Mazda MX5 NB Mk2 Sport1,840cc 4-cylinder DOHC engine.jpg|thumb|right|2002 Mazda MX5 1,840cc DOHC 4-cylinder engine, with [[S-VT|variable valve timing]] on the intake camshaft]]\n\nThe {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Mazda B engine#BP6D|BP6D]] engine was slightly modified and now featured [[S-VT|variable valve timing]] on the intake camshaft. The intake and exhaust system also received a minor upgrade. These modifications resulted in a power output of {{convert|113|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} (Japan, UK and Australia) or {{convert|107|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} (US only). In the United States, Mazda erroneously quoted the power figure for the Japanese and Australian model in early catalogues. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine and numerous owners confirmed the missing power, and Mazda offered to buy back the 2001 cars due to those misleading power claims. Owners who did not take up the buy back offer were offered an apology and free servicing for the warranty period.\n\n2002 saw the launch of the MX-5 SP. The MX-5 SP was developed and sold in Australia and its turbocharged engine produced {{convert|157|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} at 6,800&nbsp;rpm. Only 100 of these cars were built. The SP was very expensive in comparison to a standard MX-5 at the time but offered blistering performance. It has fast become a cult classic and sought after model in Australia.\n\nIn 2003 Mazda launched a campaign to target a younger group of drivers with the introduction of the Shinsen Version (SV) Miata. The Shinsen (Japanese for \"Fresh and New\") provided an intermediate step between the base model and the pricier LS.

The model continued the MX-5's philosophy of being a lightweight, [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout#Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] while featuring numerous performance improvements, however lacking its predecessor's retractable headlamps. The NB is also the only generation to feature a factory-built [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] variant in the form of the [[#Mazdaspeed MX-5 (2004\u20132005)|Mazdaspeed MX-5]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Mazda MX5 rear 20070816.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pre\u2013facelift Mazda MX-5 (NB) convertible (Europe)]]\n\nThe redesigned MX-5 was previewed at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] in October 1997. In February 1998, Mazda released the second-generation MX-5, production code NB, for the 1999 model year. The NB featured a more powerful engine and external styling cues borrowed from the [[Mazda RX-7 (FD)|third generation Mazda RX-7]], designed in 1995 by [[Tom Matano]]. Prices in the United States, the main market for the MX-5, started at [[United States dollar|US$]]19,770.\n\nAlthough many parts of the interior and body were different, the most notable changes were the headlamps: the first generation's [[hidden headlamps|retractable headlamps]] no longer passed [[pedestrian safety through vehicle design|pedestrian safety]] tests and were replaced by fixed ones. The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model and was slightly more aerodynamic than the original, with a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.36}}. Other notable improvements include a glass rear window with defogger for the convertible top and a retractable wind deflector behind the seats.\n\nThe NB continued to employ four-wheel independent suspension, with enlarged anti-roll bars at the front and rear, but the wheels, tires and brakes were significantly upgraded: [[anti-lock braking system]] was offered as an option; alloy wheels were now 14\" (360 mm) or 15\" (380 mm) in diameter and 6\" (150 mm) in width, depending on the trim package; sports models were equipped with the larger wheels and 195/50VR15 tires.\n\nThe [[Mazda B engine#BP-4W|BP-4W]] engine remained at {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}} but received several minor updates. The engine compression ratio was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.5:1 by adding slightly domed pistons. The intake cam was changed to a solid lifter design with a stronger cam; the intake runners in the head were straightened and the intake manifold was mounted higher up. Mazda's [[Variable-length intake manifold|Variable Intake Control System]] was introduced, which effectively gave a long narrow intake manifold at low rpm for better swirl, changing to a short, free-flowing manifold at high rpm for maximum breathing. Power output of the new engine was quoted at {{convert|104.4|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|157|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe {{convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Mazda B engine#B6ZE(RS)|B6]] engine remained available in Europe and Japan. The base-model {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}} NB could reach {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 7.8&nbsp;s and had a top speed of {{convert|210|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n==MX-5 10th Anniversary Model (1999)==\nIn 1999, Mazda celebrated the 10th anniversary of the MX-5 with the '''10th Anniversary Model''', a limited edition featuring some until-then exclusive features, namely a 6-speed [[manual transmission]] and [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]] shock absorbers; 15 inch polished aluminum wheels with 195/50R15 tires and a very desirable [[Torsen]] [[limited-slip differential]].<ref name=\"Special Editions\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-every-special-edition-mazda-miata-ever-so-1675339097 |title=Your Guide To Every Special Edition Mazda Miata Ever Sold In America |first=Travis |last=Okulski |website=[[Jalopnik]] |date=2015-01-30 |access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> Performance figures were slightly different, with quicker acceleration and higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in \"10th Anniversary Edition\"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue [[alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] seats and floor mats, matching 3-spoke Nardi leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, BOSE audio system, bright gauge rings, carbon grained center console panel and stainless steel scuff plates. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0\u2013{{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 7.6 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the standard 5-speed model, according to ''[[Car and Driver]]'', and 0.4 seconds faster according to ''[[Motor Trend]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/mazda-mx-5-miata-10th-anniversary-edition-short-take-road-test |title=Mazda MX-5 Miata 10th-Anniversary Edition \u2013 Short Take Road Test |first=Fred |last=Gregory |magazine=[[Car and Driver]] |date=September 1999 |accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/mazda/112_9906_2000_mazda_miata/ |title=2000 Mazda Miata 10th Anniversary Edition |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |first=Matt |last=Stone |date=June 1999 |accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref> However, in spite of the 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed increased from {{convert|210|to|214|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Combined fuel consumption improved from {{convert|8.5|to|8.0|l/100 km|abbr=on}}.\n\nEach car was sequentially numbered on a badge on the driver-side front quarter panel. A \"Certificate of Authenticity\" with the same number came with each car, signed by Mazda President James E. Miller and dated 10 February 1999. On certain markets, a gift set was also included, consisting of a 1:43 scale diecast model, two [[Seiko]]-branded wristwatches (his and hers) with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo, and metal keychain in the form of the Miata logo, all encased in a luxury blue velvet box.<ref name=Liz_Turner/>\n\nDespite the publicity that Mazda gave to this model, it took more than a year to sell all units, drawing criticism that too many units had been produced (another factor was the high price with an MSRP of $26,875, about $6500 more than a base model).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} 7,500 units of the 10th Anniversary were produced,<ref name=Liz_Turner>''You and Your MX5/Miata'', Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85960-847-7}}.</ref> with 3,700 distributed to Europe (of which: 600 \u2013 UK, 20 \u2013 Portugal), 3,150 to North America (of which 3,000 to US and 150 to Canada), 500 to Japan and 150 to Australia, with car number 7,500 being sold in the UK.\n\nFor comparison, there were 3,500 units of the [[Mazda MX-5 (NC)#Special editions (2005\u20142008)|NC's 3rd Generation Limited]] launch model in 2005, and regular limited editions produced each year do not usually exceed 1,500 units per region. The polished aluminum wheels are notorious for corroding once the thin lacquer coating is damaged. Mazda replaced thousands of sets under warranty.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} There were minor differences in specification according to the market, such as no sports appearance package (front/side/back skirts, rear wing) or air conditioning for Europe.\n\n==Mono-Posto (2000)==\nIntroduced at the [[SEMA#2000|2000 SEMA Show]], the Mono-Posto concept was designed to be a single-seat sports car inspired by the [[Lotus Eleven]] and [[Jaguar D-Type]].<ref name=\"Mono-Posto\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motor1.com/news/267366/mazda-mono-posto-concept-we-forgot/ |title=2000 Mazda Mono-Posto: Concept We Forgot |first=Adrian |last=Padeanu |website=[[Motorsport Network]] |date=2018-09-26 |accessdate=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Facelift (2001)==\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Mazda MX-5 II Facelift 20090630 front.jpg\n| image2 = Mazda MX-5 II Facelift 20090630 rear.jpg\n| caption2 = 2001 facelift\n| image3 = 2002 Mazda MX5 1.8 Sport Black Interior.jpg\n| caption3 = Facelift interior.

There were some minor exterior changes, with a press-release of July 18, 2000, announcing the changes as \"resulting in an even sportier and more forceful look\". Fog lamps, previously an option, were made standard. The headlamps now featured projector style low beams and separate high beam lenses. The rear turn signals lamps were changed from amber to clear to make the car look more modern. Some cockpit elements were changed, the most notable being the redesigned center console, and the instrument panel gauges received a white face and red numbers from the previous black and blue. The seats were also upgraded, incorporating more support in the side bolsters and taller headrests. Added for top models (designated 'Sport' in the U.K) were {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels with 205/45VR16 low-profile tires, larger brakes at the front and rear, additional chassis stiffening braces, a limited-slip differential, a 6-speed manual transmission, Bilstein suspension and leather seats. The upgraded tires and suspension allowed the new model to pull 0.91 g in lateral grip in tests by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine. The body was strengthened, gaining 16% in [[bending|bending rigidity]] and 22% in [[torsion (mechanics)|torsional rigidity]]. With the minimum of options, the 2001 model weighed {{convert|1065|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2002 Mazda MX5 NB Mk2 Sport1,840cc 4-cylinder DOHC engine.jpg|thumb|right|2002 Mazda MX5 1,840cc DOHC 4-cylinder engine, with [[S-VT|variable valve timing]] on the intake camshaft]]\n\nThe {{convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Mazda B engine#BP6D|BP6D]] engine was slightly modified and now featured [[S-VT|variable valve timing]] on the intake camshaft. The intake and exhaust system also received a minor upgrade. These modifications resulted in a power output of {{convert|113|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} (Japan, UK and Australia) or {{convert|107|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} (US only). In the United States, Mazda erroneously quoted the power figure for the Japanese and Australian model in early catalogues. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine and numerous owners confirmed the missing power, and Mazda offered to buy back the 2001 cars due to those misleading power claims. Owners who did not take up the buy back offer were offered an apology and free servicing for the warranty period.\n\n2002 saw the launch of the MX-5 SP. The MX-5 SP was developed and sold in Australia and its turbocharged engine produced {{convert|157|kW|bhp|abbr=on}} at 6,800&nbsp;rpm. Only 100 of these cars were built. The SP was very expensive in comparison to a standard MX-5 at the time but offered blistering performance. It has fast become a cult classic and sought after model in Australia.\n\nIn 2003 Mazda launched a campaign to target a younger group of drivers with the introduction of the Shinsen Version (SV) Miata. The Shinsen (Japanese for \"Fresh and New\") provided an intermediate step between the base model and the pricier LS. Equipped with most standard features on the LS, such as cruise control and aluminum brush trim.
