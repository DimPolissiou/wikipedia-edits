In  the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 elections]], Labor joined a national unity government with [[Likud]], with the post of Prime Minister rotating between the two parties.\n\nMapam broke away again during the eleventh Knesset, angry at [[Shimon Peres]]'s decision to form a national unity government with Likud. Although the Independent Liberals merged into the Alignment in the 1980s, they had no Knesset representation at the time.\n\nOn 7 October 1991, the Alignment ceased to exist, with all factions formally merged into the Labor Party. At this time, the Likud Government faced numerous problems, such as economic problems, the challenge of assimilating a large influx of immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]], serious tensions with the American government led by President [[George H.W. Bush]]{{why|date=October 2011}} and internal division.

The [[Oslo Accords]] led to a vote of confidence, which the Government won with a margin of 61\u201350 (8 abstained). Several MKs from the Government parties declined to support the Government, but on the other hand, the Arab parties came to its rescue. Due to the lack of a constitution in Israel, the Government was able to implement the accords with a thin margin.\n\nRabin's decision to advance peace talks with the Palestinians to the point of signing the [[Oslo Accords]] led to his [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassination]] by [[Yigal Amir]] in 1995. Peres decided to call early elections in 1996 to give him a mandate for advancing the peace process. However, his ploy failed; although Labor won the most seats in the [[1996 Israeli legislative election|Knesset election]], he lost to the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|election for Prime Minister]] to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] following a wave of [[suicide bombing]]s by [[Hamas]]. Netanyahu and Likud were thus able to form the government.\n\nWith his coalition falling apart, Netanyahu decided to call early elections in 1999. [[Ehud Barak]] won the internal primaries, and was nominated as the Labor candidate for Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the party entered an electoral alliance with [[Meimad]] and [[Gesher (political party)|Gesher]] called [[One Israel]]. Barak won the [[1999 Israeli prime ministerial election|Prime Minister election]], whilst One Israel won the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]], albeit with only 26 seats.\n\nBarak started by forming a 75-member coalition together with [[Shas]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]], [[Yisrael BaAliyah]], the [[National Religious Party]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]. The coalition with religious parties (NRP, Shas and UTJ) caused tensions with the [[secularism|secularist]] Meretz, who quit the coalition after a disagreement with Shas over the authority of the Deputy Education Minister. The rest of the parties left before the [[Camp David 2000 summit]].\n\n===Decline since 2001===\nFollowing the [[October 2000 riots]] and the violence of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Barak resigned from office. He then lost a [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|special election for Prime Minister]] to [[Likud]]'s [[Ariel Sharon]]. However, Labor remained in Sharon's coalition as he formed a [[national unity government]] with Likud, Labor, Shas, Yisrael BaAliyah and United Torah Judaism, and were given two of the most important cabinet portfolios; Peres was appointed [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Benjamin Ben-Eliezer]] was made [[List of Defense Ministers of Israel|Defense Minister]]. Labor supported [[Operation Defensive Shield]], which was conducted in April 2002 against Palestinians in the [[West Bank]]. After harsh criticism that Peres and Ben-Elizer were \"puppets\" of Sharon and not promoting the peace process, Labor quit the government in 2003.\n\nPrior to the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]], [[Amram Mitzna]] won the party primaries, and led the party into the election with a platform that included unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The party was routed in the elections, winning only 19 seats (its lowest ever), whilst Sharon's Likud won 38 (40 after [[Yisrael BaAliyah]] merged into the party). Subsequently, due to internal opposition, Mitzna resigned from the party leadership,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-2608896,00.html |title=Mitzna's resignation speech |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> and soon afterwards was replaced by Shimon Peres. Despite being omitted from the original right-wing coalition, Sharon invited Labor into the coalition to shore up support for the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]] (effectively Mitzna's policy which he had earlier lambasted) after the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] and the [[National Religious Party]] had left the government.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Shimon Peres was replaced as the leader of the Labor party by the election of left-wing Histadrut union leader [[Amir Peretz]] in an internal Labor party ballot. Critics of Labor have argued that, over the years, the party had abandoned its [[socialism|socialist]] heritage in favor of economic and business elites, and had passed the mantle of custodian of the underprivileged to right-wing and religious parties.<ref name=persp>Efraim Inbar: \"[http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/perspectives70.html The Decline of the Israel Labor Party]\" Perspectives Papers on Current Affairs, ''Perspectives'' 70, 23 February 2009.</ref> Peretz stated his intention to reassert Labor's traditional socialist policies, and took the party out of the government. This prompted Sharon to resign and call for new [[2006 Israeli legislative election|elections in March 2006]]. Prior to the election, the political map had been redrawn, as Sharon and the majority of Likud's MKs, together with a number of Labor MKs, including Shimon Peres, and some from other parties, had formed the new political party [[Kadima]]. In the elections Labor won 19 seats, making it the second largest party after Kadima. It joined [[Ehud Olmert]]'s Kadima-led government, with Peretz appointed Defense Minister. Labor's main coalition demand and campaign promise was raising the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1143498864586|title=Kadima, Labor talks 'making progress'|publisher=|access-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121063539/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498864586&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archive-date=21 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 2007 a leadership election resulted in Ehud Barak and Ami Ayalon defeating Peretz who was pushed into third place. In the [[Two-round system|run-off election]] (required as neither Barak nor Ayalon received over 40% of the vote), Barak was re-elected as party chairman. Despite stating that he would withdraw the party from the government unless Olmert resigned,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6699993.stm Israel party votes to oust leader] BBC News, 29 May 2007</ref> Barak remained in government and took over as Defense Minister.\n\nPrior to the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 elections]] Labor and Meimad ended their alliance, with Meimad ultimately running a joint list with the [[Green Movement (Israel)|Green Movement]] (which did not pass the electoral threshold). Several prominent members left the party, including [[Ami Ayalon]], and [[Efraim Sneh]] (who formed [[Yisrael Hazaka]]). In the elections, Labor was reduced to just 13 seats, making it the fourth largest party behind Kadima, Likud and [[Yisrael Beiteinu]].\n\nAnalysing the downfall of the once dominant political party in Israel, Efraim Inbar of the [[Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] points to several factors. By forfeiting identification with the establishment and building of the State of Israel, symbolised by a predilection for military service and by the settling of the land of Israel, Labor lost its most important asset. Deserting the Zionist symbol of Jerusalem, by showing willingness to cede part of it to the Palestinians was an ill-fated move. When cosmopolitan and individualist values made inroads into the party, it distanced itself from the collectivist ethos that has been dominant and is still widespread in Israel. Their association with the [[Oslo Accords]] meant that they could not avoid being discredited by its failure. Demographic factors have worked against Labor, as the growing [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]] population, as well as the recent Russian-Jewish immigrants, have largely voted for other parties. Attempts to gain the support of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] voters have damaged the image of the party, and yielded no harvest.<ref name=persp/>\n\n[[File:Israeli Labor seat decline.png|thumb|Seats held by the Labor party since its founding.]]\n\nOn 17 January 2011, disillusionment with party leader Ehud Barak, over his support for coalition policies, especially regarding the peace process, led to Barak's resignation from the Labor Party with four other Knesset members to establish a new \"centrist, Zionist and democratic\" party, [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]]. Following this move, all Labor Party government ministers resigned.\n\nTwo days after the split, a group of prominent members of Israel's business, technology, and cultural communities including [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] founder [[Erel Margalit]] founded the \"Avoda Now\" movement calling for a revival of the Labor Party. The movement launched a public campaign calling the people to support the Labor party, with the aim of renewing its institutions, restore its social values, and choose new dynamic leadership.<ref>{{cite news<!--|title=PR Newswire-->|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/idUS272092+27-Apr-2011+PRN20110427|title=Erel Margalit Announces His Candidacy to Lead the Labor Party|agency=Reuters|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Shelly Yachimovich]] was elected leader in 2011 saying \"I promise that we will work together.

The [[Oslo Accords]] led to a vote of confidence, which the Government won with a margin of 61\u201350 (8 abstained). Several MKs from the Government parties declined to support the Government, but on the other hand, the Arab parties came to its rescue. Due to the lack of a constitution in Israel, the Government was able to implement the accords with a thin margin.\n\nRabin's decision to advance peace talks with the Palestinians to the point of signing the [[Oslo Accords]] led to his [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassination]] by [[Yigal Amir]] in 1995. Peres decided to call early elections in 1996 to give him a mandate for advancing the peace process. However, his ploy failed; although Labor won the most seats in the [[1996 Israeli legislative election|Knesset election]], he lost to the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|election for Prime Minister]] to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] following a wave of [[suicide bombing]]s by [[Hamas]]. Netanyahu and Likud were thus able to form the government.\n\nWith his coalition falling apart, Netanyahu decided to call early elections in 1999. [[Ehud Barak]] won the internal primaries, and was nominated as the Labor candidate for Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the party entered an electoral alliance with [[Meimad]] and [[Gesher (political party)|Gesher]] called [[One Israel]]. Barak won the [[1999 Israeli prime ministerial election|Prime Minister election]], whilst One Israel won the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]], albeit with only 26 seats.\n\nBarak started by forming a 75-member coalition together with [[Shas]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]], [[Yisrael BaAliyah]], the [[National Religious Party]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]. The coalition with religious parties (NRP, Shas and UTJ) caused tensions with the [[secularism|secularist]] Meretz, who quit the coalition after a disagreement with Shas over the authority of the Deputy Education Minister. The rest of the parties left before the [[Camp David 2000 summit]].\n\n===Decline since 2001===\nFollowing the [[October 2000 riots]] and the violence of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Barak resigned from office. He then lost a [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|special election for Prime Minister]] to [[Likud]]'s [[Ariel Sharon]]. However, Labor remained in Sharon's coalition as he formed a [[national unity government]] with Likud, Labor, Shas, Yisrael BaAliyah and United Torah Judaism, and were given two of the most important cabinet portfolios; Peres was appointed [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Benjamin Ben-Eliezer]] was made [[List of Defense Ministers of Israel|Defense Minister]]. Labor supported [[Operation Defensive Shield]], which was conducted in April 2002 against Palestinians in the [[West Bank]]. After harsh criticism that Peres and Ben-Elizer were \"puppets\" of Sharon and not promoting the peace process, Labor quit the government in 2003.\n\nPrior to the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]], [[Amram Mitzna]] won the party primaries, and led the party into the election with a platform that included unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The party was routed in the elections, winning only 19 seats (its lowest ever), whilst Sharon's Likud won 38 (40 after [[Yisrael BaAliyah]] merged into the party). Subsequently, due to internal opposition, Mitzna resigned from the party leadership,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-2608896,00.html |title=Mitzna's resignation speech |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> and soon afterwards was replaced by Shimon Peres. Despite being omitted from the original right-wing coalition, Sharon invited Labor into the coalition to shore up support for the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]] (effectively Mitzna's policy which he had earlier lambasted) after the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] and the [[National Religious Party]] had left the government.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Shimon Peres was replaced as the leader of the Labor party by the election of left-wing Histadrut union leader [[Amir Peretz]] in an internal Labor party ballot. Critics of Labor have argued that, over the years, the party had abandoned its [[socialism|socialist]] heritage in favor of economic and business elites, and had passed the mantle of custodian of the underprivileged to right-wing and religious parties.<ref name=persp>Efraim Inbar: \"[http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/perspectives70.html The Decline of the Israel Labor Party]\" Perspectives Papers on Current Affairs, ''Perspectives'' 70, 23 February 2009.</ref> Peretz stated his intention to reassert Labor's traditional socialist policies, and took the party out of the government. This prompted Sharon to resign and call for new [[2006 Israeli legislative election|elections in March 2006]]. Prior to the election, the political map had been redrawn, as Sharon and the majority of Likud's MKs, together with a number of Labor MKs, including Shimon Peres, and some from other parties, had formed the new political party [[Kadima]]. In the elections Labor won 19 seats, making it the second largest party after Kadima. It joined [[Ehud Olmert]]'s Kadima-led government, with Peretz appointed Defense Minister. Labor's main coalition demand and campaign promise was raising the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1143498864586|title=Kadima, Labor talks 'making progress'|publisher=|access-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121063539/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498864586&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archive-date=21 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 2007 a leadership election resulted in Ehud Barak and Ami Ayalon defeating Peretz who was pushed into third place. In the [[Two-round system|run-off election]] (required as neither Barak nor Ayalon received over 40% of the vote), Barak was re-elected as party chairman. Despite stating that he would withdraw the party from the government unless Olmert resigned,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6699993.stm Israel party votes to oust leader] BBC News, 29 May 2007</ref> Barak remained in government and took over as Defense Minister.\n\nPrior to the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 elections]] Labor and Meimad ended their alliance, with Meimad ultimately running a joint list with the [[Green Movement (Israel)|Green Movement]] (which did not pass the electoral threshold). Several prominent members left the party, including [[Ami Ayalon]], and [[Efraim Sneh]] (who formed [[Yisrael Hazaka]]). In the elections, Labor was reduced to just 13 seats, making it the fourth largest party behind Kadima, Likud and [[Yisrael Beiteinu]].\n\nAnalysing the downfall of the once dominant political party in Israel, Efraim Inbar of the [[Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] points to several factors. By forfeiting identification with the establishment and building of the State of Israel, symbolised by a predilection for military service and by the settling of the land of Israel, Labor lost its most important asset. Deserting the Zionist symbol of Jerusalem, by showing willingness to cede part of it to the Palestinians was an ill-fated move. When cosmopolitan and individualist values made inroads into the party, it distanced itself from the collectivist ethos that has been dominant and is still widespread in Israel. Their association with the [[Oslo Accords]] meant that they could not avoid being discredited by its failure. Demographic factors have worked against Labor, as the growing [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]] population, as well as the recent Russian-Jewish immigrants, have largely voted for other parties. Attempts to gain the support of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] voters have damaged the image of the party, and yielded no harvest.<ref name=persp/>\n\n[[File:Israeli Labor seat decline.png|thumb|Seats held by the Labor party since its founding.]]\n\nOn 17 January 2011, disillusionment with party leader Ehud Barak, over his support for coalition policies, especially regarding the peace process, led to Barak's resignation from the Labor Party with four other Knesset members to establish a new \"centrist, Zionist and democratic\" party, [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]]. Following this move, all Labor Party government ministers resigned.\n\nTwo days after the split, a group of prominent members of Israel's business, technology, and cultural communities including [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] founder [[Erel Margalit]] founded the \"Avoda Now\" movement calling for a revival of the Labor Party.
