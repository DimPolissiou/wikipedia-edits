Those numbers changed in 1994 to 110, 112 and 113 respectively.<ref>[[Telephone numbers in Norway]]</ref>\n\nFor calls to the [[State Emergency Service]] about non\u2013life-threatening situations, the Australia-wide number 132 500 can be used (except in the Northern Territory).\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1969, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require the \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\" and their location if calling from a mobile phone or nomadic service. The caller is then connected to the relevant emergency service answer point as requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially important in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a mobile telephone, callers should always attempt to provide accurate location details. This will assist emergency call takers, and will expedite emergency service dispatch, as this information is not always readily available during the call.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening.  Calls for SES should be made to 132 500, however if you have already called police or another service they will have notified SES if appropriate.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered and the majority of calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stay on the line and you will be answered by the next available operator\". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/component/content/article/22-html/867-2009-victorian-bushfires-royal-commission |title=Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission |website=Victoria Department of Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 overload in Melbourne ===\nOn 3 December 2003, floods and storms in [[Melbourne]] caused a large influx of 000 calls, which prevented some calls from being answered immediately. This caused some users interviewed by authorities to believe that they may have accidentally dialled the wrong number. A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary recorded announcement be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/Document-data/Exhibits/WIT-5003-001-0151 |title=Telstra's handling of calls to 000 on the morning of 3 December 2003 |website=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |date=February 2004 |page=28}}</ref> This is not to be confused with the standard \"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" RVA, which was introduced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF |page=288}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nEmergency services and Australia's communications regulator prefer the phrase \"triple zero\" over \"triple oh\" because of potential confusion and misunderstanding over keying the number when using alpha-numeric keypads, on which the letter \"O\" is typically located on the same key as the number \"6\".\n\n=== Remote locations ===\nOne major obstacle in earlier 2009<ref name=overington2009>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/biker-mates-rue-calling-triple-0/story-e6frg6no-1225703296424 |title=Biker mates rue calling Triple-0 |date=25 April 2009 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> is that operators of triple-0 could not use GPS within GSM or CDMA systems to accurately locate distressed or injured persons using mobile phones visibly away from roads. Presently, operators must ask the caller exactly where they are. The answer to this may need to correspond to an existing road name (which may be practically impossible for distressed person(s) some kilometres away from a road) until the Emergency Service Organisation operator can dispatch an emergency service vehicle.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) began researching options that may provide improved location information for mobile services when dialing 000. \n\nIn 2013, an emergency service smartphone app was  produced and developed by [[Fire and Rescue NSW]] and the Triple Zero Awareness Working Group.<ref>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threesixtyentertainment.nesn</ref> Australians in remote locations are encouraged to use this app to contact emergency services as it uses phones GPS data to display the caller's location on the screen.

Those numbers changed in 1994 to 110, 112 and 113 respectively.<ref>[[Telephone numbers in Norway]]</ref>\n\nFor calls to the [[State Emergency Service]] about non\u2013life-threatening situations, the Australia-wide number 132 500 can be used (except in the Northern Territory).\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1969, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM Card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require the \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\" and their location if calling from a mobile phone or nomadic service. The caller is then connected to the relevant emergency service answer point as requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially important in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a mobile telephone, callers should always attempt to provide accurate location details. This will assist emergency call takers, and will expedite emergency service dispatch, as this information is not always readily available during the call.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening.  Calls for SES should be made to 132 500, however if you have already called police or another service they will have notified SES if appropriate.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered and the majority of calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stay on the line and you will be answered by the next available operator\". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/component/content/article/22-html/867-2009-victorian-bushfires-royal-commission |title=Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission |website=Victoria Department of Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 overload in Melbourne ===\nOn 3 December 2003, floods and storms in [[Melbourne]] caused a large influx of 000 calls, which prevented some calls from being answered immediately.

A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary recorded announcement be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/Document-data/Exhibits/WIT-5003-001-0151 |title=Telstra's handling of calls to 000 on the morning of 3 December 2003 |website=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |date=February 2004 |page=28}}</ref> This is not to be confused with the standard \"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" RVA, which was introduced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF |page=288}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nEmergency services and Australia's communications regulator prefer the phrase \"triple zero\" over \"triple oh\" because of potential confusion and misunderstanding over keying the number when using alpha-numeric keypads, on which the letter \"O\" is typically located on the same key as the number \"6\".\n\n=== Remote locations ===\nOne major obstacle in earlier 2009<ref name=overington2009>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/biker-mates-rue-calling-triple-0/story-e6frg6no-1225703296424 |title=Biker mates rue calling Triple-0 |date=25 April 2009 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> is that operators of triple-0 could not use GPS within GSM or CDMA systems to accurately locate distressed or injured persons using mobile phones visibly away from roads. Presently, operators must ask the caller exactly where they are.
