It was introduced into service with the [[US Navy SEALs]] in 1995.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=Patrol-Boat-Mark-V-SOC | title = Patrol Boat Mark V Special Operations Craft (SOC) High-Speed Insertion / Extraction Vessel | last = Staff Writer | first = | date = September 30, 2011 | website = MilitaryFactory.com | publisher = | access-date = 2017-05-20 | quote = The Mark V series of boats is utilized primarily by the United States Navy SEALs for high-speed insertion and extraction.}}</ref> \n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nThe development of the Mark V SOC was very fast-paced, taking only 18 months from the initiation of the program to actual delivery of the first boat on 4 September 1995. The [[United States Special Operations Command]] ( Contracting Directorate and a dedicated Program Management team executed this effort in record time, specifically because USSOCOM was given Agency level contracting authority. The contract was fulfilled when full operational capability was met in 1999. In all, 20 Mk V SOC units were delivered to [[USSOCOM]] at a unit cost of $3.7&nbsp;million. The Mark V SOC deployment, on the other hand, was less smooth.  Problems included instances of the windshield and entire pilothouse assembly collapsing upon wave impact. However, these issues have been resolved and the Mark V SOC has markedly improved maritime special operations capabilities.\n\nThe original Mk V SOC was designed to address the lack of any specifically conceived SEAL insertion craft. Prior to the Mk V SOC, SEALs traveled on any form of surface transport available, often resorting to taping lawn furniture to the deck of the available craft. The original Mk V competition included three different designs, one Kevlar composite monohull, one aluminum monohull and one aluminum catamaran hull; the aluminum monohull won. The Mk V SOC specifically incorporated a modular shock mitigation seating design to minimize injury. Experience gained during training and operational usage showed the aluminum monohull transmitted the impact with the water to the craft's occupants more readily than a composite hull. Even after modifications such as the addition of shock-absorbing seats, the boats are capable of generating up to 20 Gs of force while slamming across waves. This led to many cases of bruises, sprained ankles, chipped teeth, and back, neck and joint injuries. These injuries necessitated a replacement.\n\n===Redesign===\nOn 11 January 2008 the [[U.S. Navy]] unveiled an experimental version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft, designated the Mk V.1, designed to reduce the number of injuries sustained by sailors and [[SEAL]]s during the operation of the aluminum version of the vessel. Nicknamed the MAKO, the vessel was developed by a subsidiary of Hodgdon Shipbuilding, in collaboration with the [[University of Maine]]'s Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center. It features a hull made of layers of carbon fiber, a foam core and an outer layer of Kevlar for additional strength. It was constructed and launched at the Hodgdon Yachts East Boothbay facility. The MAKO is lighter than the current Mk V.<ref name=Mako>{{cite news | last = Hanson | first = John K., Jr. | title = Just Launched - Mako - Hodgdon Yachts, Patrol Craft MK V.1 | newspaper = Maine Boats, Homes & Harbors | location = [[Rockland, Maine]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 12, 2008 | url = http://www.maineboats.com/boat-launchings/mako-mkv1 | accessdate = 2015-11-21 }}</ref> The [[Office of Naval Research]] funded the prototype \u201cto compare the properties of composite construction with aluminum\u201d<ref name=Soundings>\n{{cite news\n| last = Editors\n| first =\n| title = Maine Builder Launches 98-Foot Ketch\n| newspaper = Soundings\n| location =\n| pages =\n| language =\n| publisher = Cruz Bay Publishing Inc.\n| date = November 8, 2006\n| url = http://www.soundingsonline.com/component/content/article/211462\n| accessdate = 2015-11-20}}\n</ref> versions of the same craft.<ref> {{cite news | last = Babb | first = Colin | title = Office of Naval Research Spearheads Development of New All-Composite Mark V.1 Patrol Boat | newspaper = News and Media Center | location = [[Arlington, Virginia]] | pages = | language = | publisher = Office of Naval Research | date = 2008 | url = http://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2008/Development-Patrol-Boat.aspx | accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> \n\n==Missions==\nThe primary mission of the Mark V is medium range insertion and extraction platform for Special Operations Forces (primarily SEAL combat swimmers) in a low to medium threat environment. The secondary mission is limited Coastal Patrol and Interdiction, specifically limited duration patrol and low to medium threat coastal interdiction. The typical Mark V SOC mission duration is 12 hours.\n\nFor example, in 2003, in one of the first actions of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Mark V SOCs operating out of Kuwait disembarked at least two platoons of Navy SEALs to capture Iraqi offshore oil terminals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dao|first=James|title=A NATION AT WAR: THE COMMANDOS; Navy Seals Easily Seize 2 Oil Sites|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/22/world/a-nation-at-war-the-commandos-navy-seals-easily-seize-2-oil-sites.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 April 2012|date=22 March 2003|quote=To protect the Seals, four Mark-5 jet-powered patrol boats, each armed with four twin-barreled 50-caliber machine guns, were stationed around the oil terminals like sentries. Navy snipers were also placed inside helicopters overhead.}}</ref>\n\n===Capabilities===\n[[File:MK V SOC launching ScanEagle.jpg|thumb|A Mark V SOC launching a [[ScanEagle]] UAV]]\nThe Mark V has the capacity to carry sixteen fully equipped SEALs to missions {{convert|500|mi|km|-2}} away from where they are based. They ride on seats that are designed for maximum comfort and shock mitigation in high seas or heavy maneuvering, and allows occupants to either stand or sit. With a beam of 17\u00bd feet, the craft has enough room to carry four [[Combat Rubber Raiding Craft]]s with six outboard motors (2 spares) and fuel, to deploy forces from a clandestine distance. The ramp on the stern allows [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] teams to ride their CRRCs right up the stern of the boat, for fast extraction and insertion.\n\nTo support the SOF missions in a medium to low threat environment, the Mk Vs are outfitted with five gun mounts for small caliber weapons supporting any combination of: [[M2 Browning machine gun|M-2 .50 cal heavy machine guns]], [[M240 machine gun|M240]] or the [[M60 machine gun|M60]] 7.62&nbsp;mm machine guns or [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|Mk19 40 mm automatic grenade launchers]]. Together these provide 360 degrees of firing coverage. To defend against aircraft, the craft has a station for firing the [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] Man-portable Air Defense System ([[MANPADS]]). Later improvements include mounting stations for GAU-17 [[Minigun]]s, MK 95 Twin .50 cal machine gun, MK 38 chain gun and [[M242|Mk48]] 25&nbsp;mm guns. Personal small arms of the crew and passengers can also be used to defend the craft.\n\nThe Mark V has many special features, besides its weapons, that make it more survivable while delivering sailors to their missions. Its angular design and low silhouette reduces its [[radar signature]] making it harder to spot and detect. Its V-hull design gives it good handling qualities in rough water as well as speed and shallow draft (four feet when cruising on-step). Its twin MTU 12-cylinder TE94 Diesel engines give it power and reliability and, coupled with the two K50S water jets, provides fast acceleration for operations near shore or in shallow waters as well as cutting down on the rooster tail effect that can make fast boats easier to see and track.\n[[File:Mark V SOC and C5.jpg|thumb|right|Transportable by C-5, 2011]]\n\n===Mark V SOC Detachment===\nThe Mark V SOC will normally operate in a two craft detachment with a Mobile Support Team. The operational detachment, also referred to as the basic Mark V SOC operating system, consists of:\n* two Mark V special operations craft, each with a crew of five special warfare combatant-craft crewmen (also known as [[SWCCs]]);\n* two Mark V SOC transporters, each with an M916A1E1 prime mover\n* four M1097 [[HMMWV]]s with S250 shelters,\n* two M1083 5-ton trucks for the 90-day containerized deployment support package (spare part, repair parts, consumables, etc.)\n* one five-ton forklift;\n* an eight-man maintenance support team, that provides technical assistance and maintenance support during mission turnaround.\n\nA Mark V SOC detachment is deployable on two USAF [[C-5 Galaxy]] aircraft to a theater of operations within 48 hours of notification and is prepared to commence operations within 24 hours after arriving at a forward staging location. The detachment can also be delivered in-theater by well or flight deck equipped surface ships with appropriate crane and deck space capabilities, and, if appropriate, under their own power. A detachment is also transportable by road.\n[[File:MKV N75.JPG|250px|thumb|right|MK V during a helicopter insertion]]\n\nThe Mark V SOC is operated by [[Naval Special Warfare Group THREE]] (formerly known as Special Boat Squadron ONE) and [[Naval Special Warfare Group FOUR]] (formerly known as Special Boat Squadron TWO) on the east and west coasts. Twelve Mark Vs are assigned to NSWG-3, Coronado, California, and eight to NSWG-4, Little Creek, Virginia.\n\n==Mark V Waterfront Operations Support Facility==\nLocated at [[Naval Air Station North Island]], [[San Diego]], California is a new facility to house operational maintenance, training and administrative functions for 12 Mark V SOC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boats.dt.navy.mil/pg2/MK5.htm |title=Military Facilities |publisher=Cash & Associates\n |accessdate=30 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410222314/http://www.boats.dt.navy.mil/pg2/MK5.htm |archivedate=10 April 2005 }}</ref> The North Island location was designed to allow rapid mobilization and transport of these vessel worldwide. The facility provides non-depot level maintenance of rolling stock and depot level maintenance of the Mark V SOC. In addition to maintenance and supply/spare parts warehousing facilities, on-site administration and training facilities with classrooms and briefing areas were provided. Final design includes a new 115' by 37' U-shaped, reinforced concrete pier, 60' long concrete floating docks to berth five vessels, and a gangway. The pier was designed to support the combined load of a 50-ton Mark V and a 70-ton marine travel lift used to lift the vessels out of the water and transport them to the maintenance facility.\n\n==Foreign use==\nIn 2009, the [[Kuwait Naval Force]] signed a $61.6-million contract with United States Marine, Inc. of [[Gulfport, MS]] for the design and construction of ten Mark V patrol boats under the [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) program for coastal interdiction, and special operations for delivery by June 2013.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/616M-to-United-States-Marine-for-10-Kuwaiti-Patrol-Boats-05447/\n | title = $61.6M to United States Marine for 10 Kuwaiti Patrol Boats\n | last = Staff\n | first =\n | date = May 26, 2009\n | website = defenseindustrydaily.com\n | publisher = Defense Industry Daily\n | access-date = 2017-03-28\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 2013, Congress was notified of a request from the [[Royal Saudi Navy|Royal Saudi Naval Forces]] to purchase 30 Mark V patrol boats, along with associated equipment, parts, training, and logistical support for $1.2 billion.

His college career for the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Cougars]] included three trips to the [[Final Four]]. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the [[1984 NBA draft]], a draft that included [[Michael Jordan]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[John Stockton]]. He combined with the 7&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (2.24&nbsp;m) [[Ralph Sampson]] to form a duo dubbed the \"Twin Towers\". The two led the Rockets to the [[1986 NBA Finals]], where they lost in six games to the [[Boston Celtics]]. After Sampson was traded to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader. He led the league in [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] twice (1989, 1990) and [[Block (basketball)|blocks]] three times (1990, 1991, 1993).\n\nDespite very nearly being traded during a bitter contract dispute before the 1992\u201393 season, he remained in Houston where in 1993\u201394, he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], and [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]] awards in the same season. His Rockets won back-to-back championships against the [[New York Knicks]] (avenging his college championship loss to [[Patrick Ewing]]), and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s Orlando Magic. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold-medal-winning [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]], and was selected as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]]. He ended his career as [[List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders|the league's all-time leader]] in [[block (basketball)|blocks]] (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a [[quadruple-double]].\n\n==Early life==\nHakeem Olajuwon was born to Salim and Abike Olajuwon, working class [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] owners of a cement business in Lagos.<ref name=\"nbabio\">[http://www.nba.com/history/players/olajuwon_bio.html Hakeem Olajuwon], nba.com/history, accessed January 3, 2007.</ref><ref>Olajuwon and Knobler.

Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's [[1981\u201382 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], played games every off season with several NBA players at the [[Fonde|Fonde Recreation Center]]. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: \"The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.\"<ref name=\"Kunta\"/>\n\nOlajuwon returned from that summer a different player. He and his teammates (including [[Clyde Drexler]]) formed what was dubbed \"Phi Slama Jama\", the first slam-dunking \"fraternity\", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive [[NCAA Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA championship games]], where they lost to [[1982\u201383 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|North Carolina State]] on a last second tip-in in 1983 and a [[Patrick Ewing]]-led [[1983\u201384 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] team in 1984.

Drexler departed for the NBA in 1983, leaving Olajuwon the lone star on the team.\n\nAfter the 1983\u201384 season, Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the [[NBA Draft Lottery]] was introduced in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: \"I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).\"<ref name=\"nbatv\"/> His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars [[Michael Jordan]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[John Stockton]], and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the [[1984 NBA draft]].\n\nIn his autobiography, ''Living the Dream'', Olajuwon mentions an intriguing draft trade offered to the Rockets that would have sent Clyde Drexler and the number two pick in the 1984 NBA draft from Portland in exchange for [[Ralph Sampson]].<ref name=\"smith\">Smith, Sam.

But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I'm gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don't know that where I'm going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can't react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a [[pivot foot]]. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake.

His college career for the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Cougars]] included three trips to the [[Final Four]]. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the [[1984 NBA draft]], a draft that included [[Michael Jordan]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[John Stockton]]. He combined with the 7&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (2.24&nbsp;m) [[Ralph Sampson]] to form a duo dubbed the \"Twin Towers\". The two led the Rockets to the [[1986 NBA Finals]], where they lost in six games to the [[Boston Celtics]]. After Sampson was traded to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader. He led the league in [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] twice (1989, 1990) and [[Block (basketball)|blocks]] three times (1990, 1991, 1993).\n\nDespite very nearly being traded during a bitter contract dispute before the 1992\u201393 season, he remained in Houston where in 1993\u201394, he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], and [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]] awards in the same season. His Rockets won back-to-back championships against the [[New York Knicks]] (avenging his college championship loss to [[Patrick Ewing]]), and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s Orlando Magic. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold-medal-winning [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]], and was selected as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]]. He ended his career as [[List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders|the league's all-time leader]] in [[block (basketball)|blocks]] (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a [[quadruple-double]].\n\n==Early life==\nHakeem Olajuwon was born to Salim and Abike Olajuwon, working class [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] owners of a cement business in Lagos.<ref name=\"nbabio\">[http://www.nba.com/history/players/olajuwon_bio.html Hakeem Olajuwon], nba.com/history, accessed January 3, 2007.</ref><ref>Olajuwon and Knobler.

Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot.

But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I'm gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don't know that where I'm going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can't react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a [[pivot foot]]. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake.

Initially assigned to flight software verification in the [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory]] (SAIL), Lindsey also served as the Astronaut Office representative working on the [[Multifunction Electronic Display System]] (MEDS) program, a glass cockpit Space Shuttle upgrade program, as well as a number of other advanced upgrade projects. In between his first two flights, he worked as the Shuttle Landing and Rollout representative responsible for training flight crews and testing orbiter landing techniques and flying qualities. After his second flight, Lindsey served as Deputy for Shuttle Operations and Co-Chairman of the Space Shuttle Cockpit Council, responsible for designing, testing, and implementing crew interfaces and displays for the $400 million Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade. More recently, he served as the Chief of International Space Station Operations for the astronaut office, responsible for integrating astronaut, civil service, and contractor activities in providing support to all aspects of the development, testing, crew training and operations of the [[International Space Station]]. After the completion of STS-121, he became [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]]. In this position, Steven also flew weather reconnaissance in the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] during the launch or landing of a Space Shuttle. Lindsey ceded his position as Chief of the Astronaut Office to astronaut [[Peggy Whitson]] when he was selected for STS-133.\n\n==Spaceflight experience==\n[[File:STS-133 Steve Lindsey exercises using the aRED.jpg|thumb|left|Lindsey exercises aboard the [[International Space Station]] during STS-133]]\nLindsey has flown five missions in space for NASA. He served as Pilot of STS-87 (1997) and STS-95 (1998) and Commander of STS-104 (2001), STS-121 (2006) and STS-133 (2011).\n\n[[STS-87]] (November 19 to December 5, 1997) was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments designed to study how the [[weightlessness|weightless]] environment of [[outer space|space]] affects various physical processes, and on observations of the [[Sun]]\u2019s outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] ([[spacewalk]]) that featured the manual capture of a [[Spartan satellite]], and tested EVA tools and procedures for future [[Space Station]] assembly. During the EVA, Lindsey piloted the first flight of the [[AERCam Sprint]], a free-flying robotic camera. The mission was accomplished in 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.\n\n[[STS-95]] (October 29 to November 7, 1998) was a 9-day mission during which the crew supported a variety of research [[Payload (air and space craft)|payloads]] including deployment and retrieval of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] Orbital Systems Test Platform, and investigations on space flight and the aging process. The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, traveling 3.6 million miles in 213 hours and 44 minutes.\n\n[[STS-104]] (July 12 to July 24, 2001), designated assembly mission 7A, was the 10th mission to the International Space Station (ISS). During the 13-day flight the crew conducted joint operations with the [[Expedition 2]] crew and performed three spacewalks to install the ISS [[Joint Airlock]] Quest and to outfit it with four [[high-pressure gas tank]]s. In addition to installing and activating the Joint Airlock, the crew also performed the first spacewalk from Quest. The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits.\n\n[[STS-121]] (July 4 to July 17, 2006) was an ISS visit and space shuttle checkout mission. It was the second flight after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] ([[STS-107]]) and was considered one of the two Return to Flight test missions before resumption of normal shuttle operations.  Lindsey served as mission commander on the flight.\n\n[[STS-133]] (February 24 to March 9, 2011) was the last flight for [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']].\n\nA veteran of five space flights, Lindsey has logged over 1,500 hours in space.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nLindsey is a distinguished graduate of the [[Undergraduate Pilot Training|Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training]] (1983).

Originally invented and used by the [[Norsemen]] (commonly known as the [[Vikings]]) for commerce, exploration, and warfare during the [[Viking Age]], many of the longship's characteristics were adopted by other cultures, like [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxons]] and continued to influence shipbuilding for centuries. The longship's design evolved over many centuries, and continuing up until the 6th century with [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built ships like [[Nydam Mose#Nydam Boat|Nydam]] and Kvalsund. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth sails (woven wool) and had numerous details and carvings on the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe longships were characterized as a graceful, long, wide and light, with a shallow-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted arbitrary beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over [[portage]]s or used bottom-up for shelter in camps. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without a turn around; this trait proved particularly useful at northern latitudes, where [[iceberg]]s and [[sea ice]] posed hazards to navigation. Longships were fitted with [[oar]]s along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions had a rectangular sail on a single mast, which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys.<ref name=\"Heath2005\">{{cite book|author=Byron Heath|title=Discovering the Great South Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOWLaNm6c7sC&pg=PA26|accessdate=2 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Rosenberg Publishing|isbn=978-1-877058-31-8|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship, but lay in the range of {{convert|5|-|10|knots|km/h|lk=in|abbr=out}} and the maximum speed of a longship under favourable conditions was around {{convert|15|kn|km/h|abbr=out}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/index.php?id=1404&L=1 |title=The Viking Ship Museum, The five Skuldelev ships |access-date=2009-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231844/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/index.php?id=1404&L=1 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>   One longship in particular can be seen in Oslo, Norway <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khm.uio.no/english/visit-us/viking-ship-museum/index.html|title=The Viking Ship Museum - Museum of Cultural History|last=Phone|first=Visiting address Museum of Cultural HistoryFrederiks gate 2 0164 Oslo Mail address P.

Archaeological finds show that the Viking ships were by no means a standard type vessel. It demonstrated true individual designs with its designers' footprints and often had regional characteristics. For example, the choice of material was mostly dictated by the regional forests, that is pine from Norway and Sweden, and oak from Denmark. Moreover, \u00a0each and every one of these Viking longships had particular features adjusted to the natural conditions, which they were exposed to.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Viking Ship|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=1282\u20131289|language=en|jstor = 4298737|last1 = Bruun|first1 = Per|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nThey were often communally owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by kings in times of conflict, in order to quickly assemble a large and powerful naval force. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were mostly used as troop transports, not warships. In the tenth century, longships would sometimes be tied together in offshore battles to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. During the 9th century peak of the Viking expansion, large fleets set out to attack the degrading Frankish empire by attacking up navigable rivers such as the Seine. Rouen was sacked in 841, the year after the death of Louis the Pious, a son of Charlemagne. Quentovic, near modern Etables, was attacked in 842 and 600 Danish ships attacked Hamburg in 845. In the same year, 129 ships returned to attack up the Seine.<ref>M Magnusson. The Vikings.

The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board.\n\n===Karvi===\nThe [[Karve (ship)|Karvi]] (or ''karve'') is the smallest vessel that is considered a longship. According to the 10th-century [[Gulating|Gulating Law]], a ship with 13 rowing benches is the smallest ship suitable for military use. A ship with 6 to 16 benches would be classified as a Karvi. These ships were considered to be \"general purpose\" ships, mainly used for fishing and trade, but occasionally commissioned for military use. While most longships held a length to width ratio of 7:1, the Karvi ships were closer to 4.5:1. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\nThe [[Gokstad Ship]] is a famous Karvi ship, built around the end of the 9th century, excavated in 1880 by Nicolay Nicolaysen. It was approximately {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=in}} long with 16 rowing positions.\n\n===Snekkja===\n[[Image:Moragsoorm.jpg|thumb|Full-scale replica of a Viking snekkja based in [[Mor\u0105g]], Poland]]\nThe ''{{lang|non|snekkja}}'' (or ''snekke'') was typically the smallest longship used in warfare and was classified as a ship with at least 20 rowing benches. A typical snekkja might have a length of {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=in}}, a width of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=in}}, and a draught of only {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=in}}. It would carry a crew of around 41 men (40 oarsmen and one cox).\n\nSnekkjas were one of the most common types of ship. According to Viking lore, [[Canute the Great]] used 1,200 in [[Norway]] in 1028,.<ref name=\"Nyerup1803\">{{cite book|author=Rasmus Nyerup|title=Historisk-statistisk Skildring af Tilstanden i Danmark og Norge, i \u00e6ldre og nyere tider|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdNAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71|accessdate=2 July 2013|year=1803|publisher=Soldin|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian snekkjas, designed for deep [[fjord]]s and Atlantic weather, typically had more draught than the Danish model designed for low coasts and beaches. Snekkjas were so light that they had no need of ports \u2014 they could simply be beached, and even carried across a portage.\n\nThe snekkjas continued to evolve after the end of the Viking age, with later Norwegian examples becoming larger and heavier than Viking age ships. A modern version is still being used in Norway, and are now called ''[[:no:snekke|snekke]]''.\n\n[[File:DRAKEN HARALD H\u00c5RFAGRE. 9.

These ships were larger warships, consisting of more than 30 rowing benches. Ships of this classification are some of the largest (see Busse) longships ever discovered. A group of these ships were discovered by Danish archaeologists in [[Roskilde]] during development in the harbour-area in 1962 and 1996\u201397. The ship discovered in 1962, ''Skuldelev 2'' is an oak-built Skeid longship. It is believed to have been built in the [[Dublin]] area around 1042. ''Skuldelev 2'' could carry a crew of some 70\u201380 and measures just less than {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=in}} in length. They had around 30 rowing chairs.

The first drakkar ship whose size was mentioned in the source was Olav Tryggvason's thirty-room Tranin, built at Nidaros in apex. 995.

It had rounded cross sections and although {{convert|65|ft|m|0|abbr=in|order=flip}} long was only {{convert|6|ft|m|0|abbr=in|order=flip}} wide. The rounded sections gave maximum displacement for the lowest wetted surface area, similar to a modern narrow rowing skiff, so were very fast but had little carrying capacity. The shape suggests mainly river use. Unlike later boats, it had a low bow and stern. A distinctive feature is the two-prong cutaway bow section.\n[[Image:Hammars (I).JPG|upright|thumb|The [[Stora Hammars stones|Stora Hammars I stone]], [[Sweden]] showing armed warriors in a longship]]\n\nThe first true longship that was rowed was the [[Nydam Mose#Nydam Boat|Nydam ship]], built in Denmark around 350&nbsp;AD. It also had very rounded underwater sections but had more pronounced flare in the topsides, giving it more stability as well as keeping more water out of the boat at speed or in waves. It had no sail. It was of lapstrake construction fastened with iron nails. The bow and stern had slight elevation. The keel was a flattened plank about twice as thick as a normal strake plank but still not strong enough to withstand the downwards thrust of a mast.\n\nThe Sutton Hoo longship, sometimes referred to as the ghost ship of the Wulflings, is about {{convert|27|x|4.5|m|ft|abbr=in}} maximum beam and built about 625&nbsp;AD. It is associated with the Saxons. The ship was crushed by the weight of soil when buried but most details have been reconstructed. The ship was similar in hull section to the Nydam ship with flared topsides. Compared to later longships, the oak planks are wide\u2014about {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=in}} including laps, with less taper at bow and stern. Planks were {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=in}} thick. The 26 heavy frames are spaced at {{convert|850|mm|in|abbr=in}} in the centre. Each frame tapers from the turn of the bilge to the inwale. This suggests that knees were used to brace the upper two or three topside planks but have rotted away. The hull had a distinctive leaf shape with the bow sections much narrower than the stern quarters. There were nine wide planks per side. The ship had a light keel plank but pronounced stem and stern deadwood. The reconstruction suggests the stern was much lower than the bow. It had a steering oar to starboard braced by an extra frame. The raised prow extended about {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=in}} above the keel and the hull was estimated to draw {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=in}} when lightly laden. Between each futtock the planks were lapped in normal clinker style and fastened with six iron rivets per plank. There is no evidence of a mast, sail, or strengthening of the keel amidships but a half-sized replica, the Soe Wylfing, sailed very well with a modest sail area.\n\nSails started to be used from possibly the 8th century. The earliest had either plaited or chequered pattern, with narrow strips sewn together.<ref>M.Magnusson.P90.Tempus.2003</ref>\n\nAbout 700&nbsp;AD the [[Kvalsund ship]] was built. It is the first with a true keel. Its cross sectional shape was flatter on the bottom with less flare to the topsides. This shape is far more stable and able to handle rougher seas. It had the high prow of the later longships. After several centuries of evolution, the fully developed longship emerged some time in the middle of the ninth century. Its long, graceful, menacing head figure carved in the stern, such as the Oseburg ship, echoed the designs of its predecessors. The mast was now square in section and located toward the middle of the ship, and could be lowered and raised. The hull's sides were fastened together to allow it to flex with the waves, combining lightness and ease of handling on land. The ships were large enough to carry cargo and passengers on long ocean voyages, but still maintained speed and agility, making the longship a versatile warship and cargo carrier.\n\n===Keel, stems and hull===\n\n[[File:Sebbe Als 2.jpg|thumb|Schematic drawing of a longship construction representing the [[Sebbe Als]] ship. It is a reconstructed ''snekke'' from Denmark.]]\n[[File:Immegram kyst.jpg|thumb|The ships' design gave both strength, agility and versatility. They could navigate the open ocean, coastal waters, fjords and many rivers and could be landed on a beach. The pictured ship is the reconstructed ''Imme Gram''.]]\nThe Viking shipbuilders had no written diagrams or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder pictured the longship before its construction, based on previous builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel was made up of several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes\u2014the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]] (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=in}} thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=in}}. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles to the surface of the plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the ''meginhufr'', was about {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=in}} thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about {{convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. Amidships, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about {{convert|170|mm|in|abbr=in}} apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.\n\nAs the planks reached the desired height, the interior frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, which is an enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about {{convert|850|mm|in|abbr=in}}. Part of the reason for this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about {{convert|700|kg|lb|abbr=in}} of iron nails in a {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=in}} long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=in}} long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard ({{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=in|disp=or}}) of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=in}} wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.\n\nThe longship's narrow deep keel provided strength beneath the waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was {{convert|100|x|300|mm|in|abbr=in}} amidships, tapering in width at the bow and stern. Sometimes there was a false outer keel to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to {{convert|560|cm|ft|abbr=in}} wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about a {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=in}} high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened to the top of the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. Evidence of small scale domestic tar production dates from between 100 AD and 400 AD. Larger industrial scale tar pits, estimated to be capable of producing up to 300 litres of tar in a single firing have been dated to between 680 AD and 900 AD.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/04/viking-longboat-industrial-tar-pits-dominance-seas|title=The secret of Viking success?

To keep seawater out, these oar holes were sealed with wooden disks from the inside, when the oars were not in use. The holes were also used for belaying mooring lines and sail sheets. At the bow the forward upper futtock protruded about {{convert|400|mm|in|abbr=in}} above the sheerline and was carved to retain anchor or mooring lines.\n\n===Timber===\nAnalysis of timber samples from Viking long boats shows that a variety of timbers were used, but there was strong preference for oak, a tree associated with [[Thor]] in Viking mythology. Oak is a heavy, durable timber that can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (wet/unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Other timber used were ash, elm, pine, spruce and larch. Spruce is light and seems to have been more common in later designs for internal hull battens (stringers). Although it is used for spars in modern times there is as yet no evidence the Vikings used spruce for masts. All timber was used unseasoned. The bark was removed by a bark spade. This consisted of a {{convert|1.2|m|ft|adj=mid|long}} wooden handle with a T crossbar at the upper end, fitted with a broad chisel-like cutting edge of iron. The cutting edge was {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=in}} wide and {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=in}} long with a {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=mid|long}} neck where the handle was inserted. It appears that in cold winters wood work stopped and partly completed timber work was buried in mud to prevent it drying out. Timber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a side axe. Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, drawknives, planes and saws. Iron saws were probably very rare. The [[Domesday Book]] in England (1086&nbsp;AD) records only 13 saws. Possibly these were pit saws and it is uncertain if they were used in longship construction.\n\n===Sail and mast===\nEven though no longship sail has been found, accounts and depictions verify that longships had square sails. Sails measured perhaps {{convert|35|to|40|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} across, and were made of [[wadmal|rough wool cloth]]. Unlike in [[knarr]]s, a longship sail was not stitched.\n\nThe sail was held in place by the mast which was up to {{convert|16|m|abbr=in}} tall. Its base was about {{convert|250|x|180|mm|abbr=in}}. The mast was supported by a large wooden maststep called a ''kerling'' (\"old woman\" in Old Norse) that was semicircular in shape. (Trent) The kerling was made of oak, and about {{convert|700|mm|abbr=in}} wide and up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=in}} long in the larger ships. It usually heavily tapered into a joint with the internal [[Kelson|keelson]], although keelsons were by no means universal. The kerling lay across two strong frames that ran width-wise above the keel in the centre of the boat. The kerling also had a companion: the \"mast fish,\" a wooden timber above the kerling just below deck height that provided extra help in keeping the mast erect. It was a large wooden baulk of timber about {{convert|3|m|abbr=in}} long with a {{convert|1.4|m|ft|adj=mid|long}} slot, facing aft to accommodate the mast as it was raised. This acted as a mechanism to catch and secure the mast before the stays were secured. It was an early form of mast partner but was aligned fore and aft. In later longships there is no mast fish-the mast partner is an athwartwise beam similar to more modern construction. Most masts were about half the length of the ship so that it did not project beyond the hull when unstepped. When lowered the mast foot was kept in the base of the mast step and the top of the mast secured in a natural wooden crook about {{convert|1.5|-|2.5|m|abbr=in}} high, on the port side, so that it did not interfere with steering on the starboard side.\n\nThere is a suggestion that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped at an angle to aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side stays and possibly fore and aft stays. Each side stay was fitted at it lower end with a {{convert|150|mm|in|adj=mid|long}} toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the side stay consisted of ropes looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about {{convert|500|-|800|mm|ft|abbr=in}} long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About four turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v-shape at the bottom of the angels \"wings\" jambed the stay preventing slippage and movement.\n\n===Rudder===\nEarly long boats used some form of steering oar but by the 10th century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word [[Port and starboard|starboard]] itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=in}} long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about {{convert|150|mm|abbr=in}}. The lower blade was about {{convert|1.8|x|0.4|m|abbr=in}}. The steerboard on the [[Gokstad ship]] in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=in|order=flip}} wide, completely flat inboard and with about a {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=in|order=flip}} maximum width at the center of the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about {{convert|200|-|300|mm|abbr=in}} apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced athwartwise. The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about {{convert|150|mm|abbr=in}} in diameter and {{convert|100|mm|abbr=in}} high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the rudder blade. From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was fastened inside the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.\n\n===Anchors===\nLongships for the most part used two different kinds of anchors. The most common was a natural wood yoke formed from a tree branch. The weight was supplied by a stone passing laterally through the U of the yoke. The top of the yoke was closed by either a length of hardwood or a curved iron head, which kept the stone in place. One side of the head stuck out so it could dig into mud or sand. In the Ladby ship burial in Denmark, a unique iron anchor has been found, resembling the modern fisherman's anchor but without the crossbar. The cross bar may have rusted away. This anchor\u2014made of Norwegian iron\u2014has a long iron chain to which the hemp warp was attached. This construction has several advantages when anchored in deep waters or in rough seas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/method/the-archaeological-sources/ladby/?T=&S=8|title=Ladby |publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Ship builders' toolkit===\n\nAt the height of Viking expansion into Dublin and Jorvik 875\u2013954 AD the longship reached a peak of development such as the Gokstad ship 890. Archaeological discoveries from this period at Coppergate, York, show the shipwright had a large range of sophisticated woodwork tools. As well as the heavy adze, broad axe, wooden mallets and wedges, the craftsman had steel tools such as anvils, files, snips, awls, augers, gouges, draw knife, knives, including folding knives, chisels and small {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=in}} long bow saws with antler handles. Edged tools were kept sharp with sharpening stones from Norway. One of the most sophisticated tools was a {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=in}} diameter twist drill bit, perfect for drilling holes for treenails. Simple mechanical pole wood lathes were used to make cups and bowls.\n\n===Replica longships===\n{{ main|Viking ship replica}}\nSince the discovery of the original longships in the 1800s, many boat builders have built [[Viking ship replica]]s. However, most have not been able to resist the temptation to use more modern techniques and tools in the construction process. In 1892\u201393, a full-size near-replica of the Gokstad ship, the Viking, was built by the Norwegian Magnus Andersen in Bergen. It was used to sail the Atlantic. It had a deeper keel with a {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=in}} draught to stiffen the hull, a range of non-authentic triangular sails to help performance, and big fenders on each gunwale filled with reindeer hair to give extra buoyancy in case of swamping. The skipper recorded that the keel bowed upwards as much as {{convert|20|mm|abbr=in}} and the gunwale flexed inwards as much as {{convert|150|mm|abbr=in}} in heavy seas.<ref>.M Andersen. Vikingfoerden, 1895</ref> A half-size replica of the Sutton Hoo longship has been equipped with a substantial sail, despite the original having oar power only.

Viking navigational techniques are not well understood, but historians postulate that the Vikings probably had some sort of primitive [[astrolabe]] and used the stars to plot their course.\n\n'''Viking Sundial'''\n\nDuring an excavation of a [[Viking Age]] farm in southern [[Greenland]] part of a circular disk with carvings was recovered. The discovery of the so-called Viking Sundial suggested a hypothesis that it was used as a compass. Archaeologists found a piece of stone and a fragment of wooden disk both featuring straight and hyperbolic carvings. It turned out that the two items had been parts of [[sundial]]s used by the Vikings as a compass during their sea-crossings along latitude 61 degrees North.<ref name=\"Philosophical Transactions 2010\"/>\n\nArchaeologists have found two devices which they interpret as navigation instruments. Both appear to be [[sundial]]s with [[gnomon]] curves etched on a flat surface. The devices are small enough to be held flat in the hand at {{convert|70|mm|abbr=in}} diameter. A wooden version dated to about 1000&nbsp;AD was found in Greenland. A stone version was also found at [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]], Greenland. By looking at the place where the shadow from the rod falls on a carved curve, a navigator is able to sail along a line of latitude. Both gnomon curve devices show the curve for 61\u00b0 north very prominently. This was the approximate latitude that the Vikings would have sailed along to get to Greenland from Scandinavia. The wooden device also has north marked and had 32 arrow heads around the edge that may be the points of a compass. Other lines are interpreted as the solstice and equinox curves. The device was tested successfully, as a [[Solar compass|sun compass]], during a 1984 reenactment when a longship sailed across the North Atlantic. It was accurate to within \u00b1 5\u00b0.<ref>Cultural Atlas of the Viking World. Ed. [[James Graham-Campbell|J Graham Campbell]] et al. Andromeda. 1994.</ref>\n\n'''Hypothesis'''\n\nThe Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou suggested in 1967 that the \"[[Sunstone (medieval)|sun-stones]]\" referred to in some sagas might have been natural crystals capable of polarizing skylight. The mineral [[cordierite]] occurring in Norway has the local name \"Viking's Compass.\" Its changes in colour would allow determining the sun's position (azimuth) even through an overcast or foggy horizon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polarization.com/viking/viking.html |title=The Viking Sunstone |publisher=Polarization.net}}</ref> The sunstones are [[birefringence|doubly refracting]], meaning that objects viewed through them can be seen as double because of positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged carbonate ions. When looking at the sun the stone, it will project two overlapping shadows on the crystal. The opacities of these shadows will vary depending on the sunstone's direction to the sun. When the two projected shapes have exactly the same opacity, it means the stone's long side is facing directly toward the sun. Since the stone uses light polarization, it works the best when the sun is at lower altitudes, or closer to the horizon. It makes sense that Norsemen were able to make use of sunstones, since much of the area they travelled and explored was near polar,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A depolarizer as a possible precise sunstone for Viking navigation by polarized skylight|journal = Proc.

Karlsen.<ref>[http://www.oneearthpress.com/pdf/nav_notes.pdf One Earth Press]</ref> To derive a course to steer relative to the sun direction, he uses a sun-stone (solarsteinn) made of [[Iceland spar]] (optical calcite or silfurberg), and a \"horizon-board.\" The author constructed the latter from an Icelandic saga source, and describes an experiment performed to determine its accuracy. Karlsen also discusses why on North Atlantic trips the Vikings might have preferred to navigate by the sun rather than by stars, as at high latitudes in summer the days are long and the nights short.\n\nA Viking named Stjerner Oddi compiled a chart showing the direction of sunrise and sunset, which enabled navigators to sail longships from place to place with ease. Almgren, an earlier Viking, told of another method: \"All the measurements of angles were made with what was called a 'half wheel' (a kind of half sun-diameter which corresponds to about sixteen minutes of arc). This was something that was known to every skipper at that time, or to the long-voyage pilot or ''kendtmand'' ('man who knows the way') who sometimes went along on voyages&nbsp;... When the sun was in the sky, it was not, therefore, difficult to find the four points of the compass, and determining latitude did not cause any problems either.\" (Almgrem){{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBirds provided a helpful guide to finding land. A Viking legend states that Vikings used to take caged crows aboard ships and let them loose if they got lost. The crows would instinctively head for land, giving the sailors a course to steer.\n\n===Propulsion===\n\nThe longships had two methods of propulsion: oars and sail. At sea, the sail enabled longships to travel faster than by oar and to cover long distances overseas with far less manual effort. Sails could be raised or lowered quickly. In a modern facsimile the mast can be lowered in 90 seconds. Oars were used when near the coast or in a river, to gain speed quickly, and when there was an adverse (or insufficient) wind. In combat, the variability of wind power made rowing the chief means of propulsion. The ship was steered by a vertical flat blade with a short round handle, at right angles, mounted over the starboard side of the aft gunwale.\n\nLongships were not fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on sea chests (chests containing their personal possessions) that would otherwise take up space. The chests were made the same size and were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as oarlocks. If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.\n\nAn innovation that improved the sail's performance was the [[beitass]], or stretching pole\u2014a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward performance of the ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking the beitass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached to the luff and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about {{convert|500|to|700|mm|ft|abbr=in}} long on the outside of the hull.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Tapisserie bato1.jpg|thumb|Image from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing [[Harold Godwinson]]'s ship approaching a beach, probably in the Somme Estuary<ref>Wolfgang Grape, The Bayeux Tapestry, Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1365-7}}. p. 95.</ref>]]\nThe Vikings were major contributors to the shipbuilding technology of their day. Their shipbuilding methods spread through extensive contact with other cultures, and ships from the 11th and 12th centuries are known to borrow many of the longships' design features, despite the passing of many centuries. The [[Poveiro (boat)|Lancha Poveira]], a boat from [[P\u00f3voa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]] is one of the last remnants from the longship, keeping all the longboat features but without a long [[stern]] and bow, and with a [[Lateen|lateen sail]]. It was used until the 1950s. Today there is just one boat: ''F\u00e9 em Deus''.\n\nMany historians, archaeologists and adventurers have reconstructed longships in an attempt to understand how they worked.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.havhingsten.dk Sea Stallion from Glendalough 2007]</ref> These re-creators have been able to identify many of the advances that the Vikings implemented in order to make the longship a superior vessel.\n\nThe longship was a master of all trades. It was wide and stable, yet light, fast, and nimble. With all these qualities combined in one ship, the longship was unrivalled for centuries, until the arrival of the great [[Cog (ship)|cog]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the longship was the usual vessel for war even with the introduction of cogs in the 12th\u201313th centuries. [[Leidang]] fleet-levy laws remained in place for most of the Middle Ages, demanding that the freemen should build, man and furnish ships for war if demanded by the king\u2014ships with at least 20 or 25 oar-pairs (40\u201350+ rowers). However, by the late 14th century, these low-boarded vessels were at a disadvantage against newer, taller vessels\u2014when the [[Victual Brothers]], in the employ of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], attacked [[Bergen]] in the autumn of 1393, the \"great ships\" of the pirates could not be boarded by the Norwegian levy ships called out by [[Margaret I of Denmark]], and the raiders were able to sack the town with impunity. While earlier times had seen larger and taller longships in service, by this time the authorities had also gone over to other types of ships for warfare. The last Viking longship was defeated in 1429.\n\n== Notable longships ==\n\n=== Preserved originals ===\nSeveral of the original longships built in the Viking Age have been excavated by archaeologists. A selection of vessels that has been particularly important to our understanding of the longships design and construction, comprise the following:\n\n* The [[Nydam Mose#Nydam Boat|Nydam ship]] (c. 310\u2013320 AD) is a burial ship from Denmark. This oaken vessel is {{convert|80|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} long and was propelled by oars only. No mast is attached, as it was a later addition to the longship design. The Nydam ship shows a combination of building styles and is important to our understanding of the evolution of the early Viking ships.\n* \"''[[Puck 2]]''\" is the name given to a longship found in the [[Bay of Gdansk]] in Poland in 1977. It has been dated to the first half of the 10th century and was 19\u201320 metres long in its day. It is peculiar and important because it was constructed by [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] craftsmen, not Scandinavian. The design only differs very slightly from the Scandinavian built longships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/method/the-archaeological-sources/puck-2-a-slavic-longship/|title=Puck 2 - a Slavic longship |publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n* \"''[[Hedeby 1]]''\" is the name given to a longship found in the harbour of [[Hedeby]] in 1953. At nearly 31 metres long, it is of the Skeid type, built around 985 AD. With a maximum width of just 2.7 metres it has a width-to-length ratio of more than 11, making it the slimmest longship ever discovered. It is made of oaken wood and its construction would have required a very high level of craftsmanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/method/the-archaeological-sources/the-longship-from-haithabu-harbour/|title=The longship from Haithabu Harbour |publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n* The [[Oseberg ship]] and the [[Gokstad ship]] \u2013 both from Vestfold in Norway. They both represent the longship design of the later Viking Age.\n* \"''[[Skuldelev 2]]''\" is the name given to the longest longship ever found at approximately 30 metres. It was discovered in 1996\u201397 at the [[Viking Ship Museum (Roskilde)|Viking Ship Museum]] in Roskilde, Denmark. The ship was built near Dublin around 1042. Longships were constructed progressively longer near the end of the Viking Age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/the-five-viking-ships/skuldelev-2/|title=Skuldelev 2|publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical examples ===\nA selection of important longships known only from written sources includes:\n\n* The [[Ormen Lange (longship)|Ormen Lange]] (\"''The Long Serpent''\") was the most famous longship of Norwegian king [[Olaf Tryggvason]].\n* The [[Mora (ship)|Mora]] was the ship given to [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] by his wife, [[Matilda of Flanders|Matilda]], and used as the flagship in the [[Norman conquest of England]]. It is said to be of the ''drakar'' type.\n* The Mariasuda, flagship of Norwegian king [[King Sverre|Sverre]] at the [[Battle of Fimreite]], the largest recorded longship.\n\n=== Replicas ===\n[[Image:Viking, replica of the Gokstad Viking ship, at the Chicago World Fair 1893.jpg|thumb|A replica of the Gokstad ship, named [[Viking (replica Viking longship)|''Viking'']], was sailed across the Atlantic to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893.]]There are many replicas of Viking ships - including longships - in existence. Some are just inspired by the longship design in general, while others are intricate works of experimental archaeology, trying to replicate the originals as accurately as possible. Replicas important to our understanding of the original longships design and construction include:\n* ''[[Viking (replica Viking longship)|Viking]]'', the very first Viking ship replica, was built by the [[Framn\u00e6s Mekaniske V\u00e6rksted|R\u00f8dsverven shipyard]] in [[Sandefjord, Norway]], modelled after the Gokstad ship. In 1893, it sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Chicago]] in The [[United States]] for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].\n* The Skuldelev replicas. All the five [[Skuldelev ships]] have been replicated, some of them several times. They are each of a different design and only Skuldelev 1, 2 and 5 are longships.\n* The [[Sea Stallion (longship)|Sea Stallion]] is a replica of the Skuldelev 2 ship, constructed by authentic methods. At {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=in}}, it is the second longest Viking ship replica ever made. Skuldelev 2 was originally built near Dublin around 1042, and was rediscovered in Roskilde, Denmark in 1962. The Sea Stallion sailed from Roskilde to Dublin in summer 2007, to commemorate the voyage of the original.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In the winter 2007\u20132008, The Sea Stallion was exhibited outside the National Museum in Dublin. In the summer of 2008, the Sea Stallion returned to Roskilde on a searoute south of England.\n* [[Dragon Harald Fairhair (ship)|Dragon Harald Fairhair]] is the largest longship built in modern times at {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=in}}. The ship is not a replica of any specific original longship, but was built by authentic construction methods. It was constructed in [[Haugesund, Norway]] and launched in 2012.\n* The [[\u00cdslendingur|\u00cdslendingur (Icelander)]] is a {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=in}} replica of the Gokstad ship that was built using traditional building techniques.

Originally invented and used by the [[Norsemen]] (commonly known as the [[Vikings]]) for commerce, exploration, and warfare during the [[Viking Age]], many of the longship's characteristics were adopted by other cultures, like [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxons]] and continued to influence shipbuilding for centuries. The longship's design evolved over many centuries, and continuing up until the 6th century with [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built ships like [[Nydam Mose#Nydam Boat|Nydam]] and Kvalsund. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth sails (woven wool) and had numerous details and carvings on the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe longships were characterized as a graceful, long, wide and light, with a shallow-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted arbitrary beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over [[portage]]s or used bottom-up for shelter in camps. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without a turn around; this trait proved particularly useful at northern latitudes, where [[iceberg]]s and [[sea ice]] posed hazards to navigation. Longships were fitted with [[oar]]s along almost the entire length of the boat itself.

Archaeological finds show that the Viking ships were by no means a standard type vessel. It demonstrated true individual designs with its designers' footprints and often had regional characteristics. For example, the choice of material was mostly dictated by the regional forests, that is pine from Norway and Sweden, and oak from Denmark. Moreover, \u00a0each and every one of these Viking longships had particular features adjusted to the natural conditions, which they were exposed to.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Viking Ship|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=1282\u20131289|language=en|jstor = 4298737|last1 = Bruun|first1 = Per|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nThey were often communally owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by kings in times of conflict, in order to quickly assemble a large and powerful naval force. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were mostly used as troop transports, not warships. In the tenth century, longships would sometimes be tied together in offshore battles to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. During the 9th century peak of the Viking expansion, large fleets set out to attack the degrading Frankish empire by attacking up navigable rivers such as the Seine. Rouen was sacked in 841, the year after the death of Louis the Pious, a son of Charlemagne. Quentovic, near modern Etables, was attacked in 842 and 600 Danish ships attacked Hamburg in 845. In the same year, 129 ships returned to attack up the Seine.<ref>M Magnusson. The Vikings.

The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board.\n\n===Karvi===\nThe [[Karve (ship)|Karvi]] (or ''karve'') is the smallest vessel that is considered a longship. According to the 10th-century [[Gulating|Gulating Law]], a ship with 13 rowing benches is the smallest ship suitable for military use. A ship with 6 to 16 benches would be classified as a Karvi. These ships were considered to be \"general purpose\" ships, mainly used for fishing and trade, but occasionally commissioned for military use. While most longships held a length to width ratio of 7:1, the Karvi ships were closer to 4.5:1. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\nThe [[Gokstad Ship]] is a famous Karvi ship, built around the end of the 9th century, excavated in 1880 by Nicolay Nicolaysen. It was approximately {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=in}} long with 16 rowing positions.\n\n===Snekkja===\n[[Image:Moragsoorm.jpg|thumb|Full-scale replica of a Viking snekkja based in [[Mor\u0105g]], Poland]]\nThe ''{{lang|non|snekkja}}'' (or ''snekke'') was typically the smallest longship used in warfare and was classified as a ship with at least 20 rowing benches. A typical snekkja might have a length of {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=in}}, a width of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=in}}, and a draught of only {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=in}}. It would carry a crew of around 41 men (40 oarsmen and one cox).\n\nSnekkjas were one of the most common types of ship. According to Viking lore, [[Canute the Great]] used 1,200 in [[Norway]] in 1028,.<ref name=\"Nyerup1803\">{{cite book|author=Rasmus Nyerup|title=Historisk-statistisk Skildring af Tilstanden i Danmark og Norge, i \u00e6ldre og nyere tider|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdNAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71|accessdate=2 July 2013|year=1803|publisher=Soldin|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian snekkjas, designed for deep [[fjord]]s and Atlantic weather, typically had more draught than the Danish model designed for low coasts and beaches. Snekkjas were so light that they had no need of ports \u2014 they could simply be beached, and even carried across a portage.\n\nThe snekkjas continued to evolve after the end of the Viking age, with later Norwegian examples becoming larger and heavier than Viking age ships. A modern version is still being used in Norway, and are now called ''[[:no:snekke|snekke]]''.\n\n[[File:DRAKEN HARALD H\u00c5RFAGRE. 9.

These ships were larger warships, consisting of more than 30 rowing benches. Ships of this classification are some of the largest (see Busse) longships ever discovered.

The ship discovered in 1962, ''Skuldelev 2'' is an oak-built Skeid longship. It is believed to have been built in the [[Dublin]] area around 1042. ''Skuldelev 2'' could carry a crew of some 70\u201380 and measures just less than {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=in}} in length. They had around 30 rowing chairs.

The first drakkar ship whose size was mentioned in the source was Olav Tryggvason's thirty-room Tranin, built at Nidaros in apex. 995.

It had rounded cross sections and although {{convert|65|ft|m|0|abbr=in|order=flip}} long was only {{convert|6|ft|m|0|abbr=in|order=flip}} wide. The rounded sections gave maximum displacement for the lowest wetted surface area, similar to a modern narrow rowing skiff, so were very fast but had little carrying capacity. The shape suggests mainly river use. Unlike later boats, it had a low bow and stern. A distinctive feature is the two-prong cutaway bow section.\n[[Image:Hammars (I).JPG|upright|thumb|The [[Stora Hammars stones|Stora Hammars I stone]], [[Sweden]] showing armed warriors in a longship]]\n\nThe first true longship that was rowed was the [[Nydam Mose#Nydam Boat|Nydam ship]], built in Denmark around 350&nbsp;AD. It also had very rounded underwater sections but had more pronounced flare in the topsides, giving it more stability as well as keeping more water out of the boat at speed or in waves. It had no sail. It was of lapstrake construction fastened with iron nails. The bow and stern had slight elevation. The keel was a flattened plank about twice as thick as a normal strake plank but still not strong enough to withstand the downwards thrust of a mast.\n\nThe Sutton Hoo longship, sometimes referred to as the ghost ship of the Wulflings, is about {{convert|27|x|4.5|m|ft|abbr=in}} maximum beam and built about 625&nbsp;AD. It is associated with the Saxons. The ship was crushed by the weight of soil when buried but most details have been reconstructed. The ship was similar in hull section to the Nydam ship with flared topsides. Compared to later longships, the oak planks are wide\u2014about {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=in}} including laps, with less taper at bow and stern. Planks were {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=in}} thick. The 26 heavy frames are spaced at {{convert|850|mm|in|abbr=in}} in the centre. Each frame tapers from the turn of the bilge to the inwale. This suggests that knees were used to brace the upper two or three topside planks but have rotted away. The hull had a distinctive leaf shape with the bow sections much narrower than the stern quarters. There were nine wide planks per side. The ship had a light keel plank but pronounced stem and stern deadwood. The reconstruction suggests the stern was much lower than the bow. It had a steering oar to starboard braced by an extra frame. The raised prow extended about {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=in}} above the keel and the hull was estimated to draw {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=in}} when lightly laden. Between each futtock the planks were lapped in normal clinker style and fastened with six iron rivets per plank. There is no evidence of a mast, sail, or strengthening of the keel amidships but a half-sized replica, the Soe Wylfing, sailed very well with a modest sail area.\n\nSails started to be used from possibly the 8th century. The earliest had either plaited or chequered pattern, with narrow strips sewn together.<ref>M.Magnusson.P90.Tempus.2003</ref>\n\nAbout 700&nbsp;AD the [[Kvalsund ship]] was built. It is the first with a true keel. Its cross sectional shape was flatter on the bottom with less flare to the topsides. This shape is far more stable and able to handle rougher seas. It had the high prow of the later longships. After several centuries of evolution, the fully developed longship emerged some time in the middle of the ninth century. Its long, graceful, menacing head figure carved in the stern, such as the Oseburg ship, echoed the designs of its predecessors. The mast was now square in section and located toward the middle of the ship, and could be lowered and raised. The hull's sides were fastened together to allow it to flex with the waves, combining lightness and ease of handling on land. The ships were large enough to carry cargo and passengers on long ocean voyages, but still maintained speed and agility, making the longship a versatile warship and cargo carrier.\n\n===Keel, stems and hull===\n\n[[File:Sebbe Als 2.jpg|thumb|Schematic drawing of a longship construction representing the [[Sebbe Als]] ship. It is a reconstructed ''snekke'' from Denmark.]]\n[[File:Immegram kyst.jpg|thumb|The ships' design gave both strength, agility and versatility. They could navigate the open ocean, coastal waters, fjords and many rivers and could be landed on a beach. The pictured ship is the reconstructed ''Imme Gram''.]]\nThe Viking shipbuilders had no written diagrams or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder pictured the longship before its construction, based on previous builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel was made up of several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes\u2014the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]] (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=in}} thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=in}}. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles to the surface of the plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the ''meginhufr'', was about {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=in}} thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about {{convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. Amidships, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about {{convert|170|mm|in|abbr=in}} apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.\n\nAs the planks reached the desired height, the interior frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, which is an enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about {{convert|850|mm|in|abbr=in}}. Part of the reason for this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about {{convert|700|kg|lb|abbr=in}} of iron nails in a {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=in}} long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=in}} long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard ({{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=in|disp=or}}) of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=in}} wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.\n\nThe longship's narrow deep keel provided strength beneath the waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was {{convert|100|x|300|mm|in|abbr=in}} amidships, tapering in width at the bow and stern. Sometimes there was a false outer keel to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to {{convert|560|cm|ft|abbr=in}} wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about a {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=in}} high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened to the top of the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. Evidence of small scale domestic tar production dates from between 100 AD and 400 AD. Larger industrial scale tar pits, estimated to be capable of producing up to 300 litres of tar in a single firing have been dated to between 680 AD and 900 AD.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/04/viking-longboat-industrial-tar-pits-dominance-seas|title=The secret of Viking success?

To keep seawater out, these oar holes were sealed with wooden disks from the inside, when the oars were not in use. The holes were also used for belaying mooring lines and sail sheets. At the bow the forward upper futtock protruded about {{convert|400|mm|in|abbr=in}} above the sheerline and was carved to retain anchor or mooring lines.\n\n===Timber===\nAnalysis of timber samples from Viking long boats shows that a variety of timbers were used, but there was strong preference for oak, a tree associated with [[Thor]] in Viking mythology. Oak is a heavy, durable timber that can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (wet/unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Other timber used were ash, elm, pine, spruce and larch. Spruce is light and seems to have been more common in later designs for internal hull battens (stringers). Although it is used for spars in modern times there is as yet no evidence the Vikings used spruce for masts. All timber was used unseasoned. The bark was removed by a bark spade. This consisted of a {{convert|1.2|m|ft|adj=mid|long}} wooden handle with a T crossbar at the upper end, fitted with a broad chisel-like cutting edge of iron. The cutting edge was {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=in}} wide and {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=in}} long with a {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=mid|long}} neck where the handle was inserted. It appears that in cold winters wood work stopped and partly completed timber work was buried in mud to prevent it drying out. Timber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a side axe. Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, drawknives, planes and saws. Iron saws were probably very rare. The [[Domesday Book]] in England (1086&nbsp;AD) records only 13 saws. Possibly these were pit saws and it is uncertain if they were used in longship construction.\n\n===Sail and mast===\nEven though no longship sail has been found, accounts and depictions verify that longships had square sails. Sails measured perhaps {{convert|35|to|40|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} across, and were made of [[wadmal|rough wool cloth]]. Unlike in [[knarr]]s, a longship sail was not stitched.\n\nThe sail was held in place by the mast which was up to {{convert|16|m|abbr=in}} tall. Its base was about {{convert|250|x|180|mm|abbr=in}}. The mast was supported by a large wooden maststep called a ''kerling'' (\"old woman\" in Old Norse) that was semicircular in shape. (Trent) The kerling was made of oak, and about {{convert|700|mm|abbr=in}} wide and up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=in}} long in the larger ships. It usually heavily tapered into a joint with the internal [[Kelson|keelson]], although keelsons were by no means universal. The kerling lay across two strong frames that ran width-wise above the keel in the centre of the boat. The kerling also had a companion: the \"mast fish,\" a wooden timber above the kerling just below deck height that provided extra help in keeping the mast erect. It was a large wooden baulk of timber about {{convert|3|m|abbr=in}} long with a {{convert|1.4|m|ft|adj=mid|long}} slot, facing aft to accommodate the mast as it was raised. This acted as a mechanism to catch and secure the mast before the stays were secured. It was an early form of mast partner but was aligned fore and aft. In later longships there is no mast fish-the mast partner is an athwartwise beam similar to more modern construction. Most masts were about half the length of the ship so that it did not project beyond the hull when unstepped. When lowered the mast foot was kept in the base of the mast step and the top of the mast secured in a natural wooden crook about {{convert|1.5|-|2.5|m|abbr=in}} high, on the port side, so that it did not interfere with steering on the starboard side.\n\nThere is a suggestion that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped at an angle to aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side stays and possibly fore and aft stays. Each side stay was fitted at it lower end with a {{convert|150|mm|in|adj=mid|long}} toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the side stay consisted of ropes looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about {{convert|500|-|800|mm|ft|abbr=in}} long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About four turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v-shape at the bottom of the angels \"wings\" jambed the stay preventing slippage and movement.\n\n===Rudder===\nEarly long boats used some form of steering oar but by the 10th century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word [[Port and starboard|starboard]] itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=in}} long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about {{convert|150|mm|abbr=in}}. The lower blade was about {{convert|1.8|x|0.4|m|abbr=in}}. The steerboard on the [[Gokstad ship]] in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=in|order=flip}} wide, completely flat inboard and with about a {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=in|order=flip}} maximum width at the center of the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about {{convert|200|-|300|mm|abbr=in}} apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced athwartwise. The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about {{convert|150|mm|abbr=in}} in diameter and {{convert|100|mm|abbr=in}} high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the rudder blade. From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was fastened inside the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.\n\n===Anchors===\nLongships for the most part used two different kinds of anchors. The most common was a natural wood yoke formed from a tree branch. The weight was supplied by a stone passing laterally through the U of the yoke. The top of the yoke was closed by either a length of hardwood or a curved iron head, which kept the stone in place. One side of the head stuck out so it could dig into mud or sand. In the Ladby ship burial in Denmark, a unique iron anchor has been found, resembling the modern fisherman's anchor but without the crossbar. The cross bar may have rusted away. This anchor\u2014made of Norwegian iron\u2014has a long iron chain to which the hemp warp was attached. This construction has several advantages when anchored in deep waters or in rough seas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/method/the-archaeological-sources/ladby/?T=&S=8|title=Ladby |publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Ship builders' toolkit===\n\nAt the height of Viking expansion into Dublin and Jorvik 875\u2013954 AD the longship reached a peak of development such as the Gokstad ship 890. Archaeological discoveries from this period at Coppergate, York, show the shipwright had a large range of sophisticated woodwork tools. As well as the heavy adze, broad axe, wooden mallets and wedges, the craftsman had steel tools such as anvils, files, snips, awls, augers, gouges, draw knife, knives, including folding knives, chisels and small {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=in}} long bow saws with antler handles. Edged tools were kept sharp with sharpening stones from Norway. One of the most sophisticated tools was a {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=in}} diameter twist drill bit, perfect for drilling holes for treenails. Simple mechanical pole wood lathes were used to make cups and bowls.\n\n===Replica longships===\n{{ main|Viking ship replica}}\nSince the discovery of the original longships in the 1800s, many boat builders have built [[Viking ship replica]]s. However, most have not been able to resist the temptation to use more modern techniques and tools in the construction process. In 1892\u201393, a full-size near-replica of the Gokstad ship, the Viking, was built by the Norwegian Magnus Andersen in Bergen. It was used to sail the Atlantic. It had a deeper keel with {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=in}} draught to stiffen the hull and a range of non-authentic triangular sails to help performance and big fenders on each gunwale filled with reindeer hair to give extra buoyancy in case of swamping. The skipper recorded that the keel bowed upwards as much as {{convert|20|mm|abbr=in}} and the gunwale flexed inwards as much as {{convert|150|mm|abbr=in}} in heavy seas.<ref>.M Andersen.

One of the keys to their success was the ability to navigate skillfully across the open waters.<ref name=\"Philosophical Transactions 2010\">{{Cite journal|title=On the trail of Vikings with polarized skylight: experimental study of the atmospheric optical prerequisites allowing polarimetric navigation by Viking seafarers|journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences|volume=366|issue=1565|pages=772\u2013782|language=en|jstor = 41061780|last1 = Horv\u00e1th|first1 = G\u00e1bor|last2=Barta|first2=Andr\u00e1s|last3=Pomozi|first3=Istv\u00e1n|last4=Suhai|first4=Bence|last5=Heged\u00fcs|first5=Ram\u00f3n|last6=\u00c5kesson|first6=Susanne|last7=Meyer-Rochow|first7=Benno|last8=Wehner|first8=R\u00fcdiger|year=2011|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0194|pmid=21282181|pmc=3049005}}</ref> The Vikings were experts in judging speed and wind direction, and in knowing the current and when to expect high and low tides. Viking navigational techniques are not well understood, but historians postulate that the Vikings probably had some sort of primitive [[astrolabe]] and used the stars to plot their course.\n\n'''Viking Sundial'''\n\nDuring an excavation of a [[Viking Age]] farm in southern [[Greenland]] part of a circular disk with carvings was recovered. The discovery of the so-called Viking Sundial suggested a hypothesis that it was used as a compass. Archaeologists found a piece of stone and a fragment of wooden disk both featuring straight and hyperbolic carvings. It turned out that the two items had been parts of [[sundial]]s used by the Vikings as a compass during their sea-crossings along latitude 61 degrees North.<ref name=\"Philosophical Transactions 2010\"/>\n\nArchaeologists have found two devices which they interpret as navigation instruments. Both appear to be [[sundial]]s with [[gnomon]] curves etched on a flat surface. The devices are small enough to be held flat in the hand at {{convert|70|mm|abbr=in}} diameter. A wooden version dated to about 1000&nbsp;AD was found in Greenland. A stone version was also found at [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]], Greenland. By looking at the place where the shadow from the rod falls on a carved curve, a navigator is able to sail along a line of latitude. Both gnomon curve devices show the curve for 61\u00b0 north very prominently. This was the approximate latitude that the Vikings would have sailed along to get to Greenland from Scandinavia. The wooden device also has north marked and had 32 arrow heads around the edge that may be the points of a compass. Other lines are interpreted as the solstice and equinox curves. The device was tested successfully, as a [[Solar compass|sun compass]], during a 1984 reenactment when a longship sailed across the North Atlantic. It was accurate to within \u00b1 5\u00b0.<ref>Cultural Atlas of the Viking World. Ed. [[James Graham-Campbell|J Graham Campbell]] et al. Andromeda. 1994.</ref>\n\n'''Hypothesis'''\n\nThe Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou suggested in 1967 that the \"[[Sunstone (medieval)|sun-stones]]\" referred to in some sagas might have been natural crystals capable of polarizing skylight. The mineral [[cordierite]] occurring in Norway has the local name \"Viking's Compass.\" Its changes in colour would allow determining the sun's position (azimuth) even through an overcast or foggy horizon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polarization.com/viking/viking.html |title=The Viking Sunstone |publisher=Polarization.net}}</ref> The sunstones are [[birefringence|doubly refracting]], meaning that objects viewed through them can be seen as double because of positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged carbonate ions. When looking at the sun the stone, it will project two overlapping shadows on the crystal. The opacities of these shadows will vary depending on the sunstone's direction to the sun. When the two projected shapes have exactly the same opacity, it means the stone's long side is facing directly toward the sun. Since the stone uses light polarization, it works the best when the sun is at lower altitudes, or closer to the horizon. It makes sense that Norsemen were able to make use of sunstones, since much of the area they travelled and explored was near polar,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A depolarizer as a possible precise sunstone for Viking navigation by polarized skylight|journal = Proc.

Karlsen.<ref>[http://www.oneearthpress.com/pdf/nav_notes.pdf One Earth Press]</ref> To derive a course to steer relative to the sun direction, he uses a sun-stone (solarsteinn) made of [[Iceland spar]] (optical calcite or silfurberg), and a \"horizon-board.\" The author constructed the latter from an Icelandic saga source, and describes an experiment performed to determine its accuracy. Karlsen also discusses why on North Atlantic trips the Vikings might have preferred to navigate by the sun rather than by stars, as at high latitudes in summer the days are long and the nights short.\n\nA Viking named Stjerner Oddi compiled a chart showing the direction of sunrise and sunset, which enabled navigators to sail longships from place to place with ease. Almgren, an earlier Viking, told of another method: \"All the measurements of angles were made with what was called a 'half wheel' (a kind of half sun-diameter which corresponds to about sixteen minutes of arc). This was something that was known to every skipper at that time, or to the long-voyage pilot or ''kendtmand'' ('man who knows the way') who sometimes went along on voyages&nbsp;... When the sun was in the sky, it was not, therefore, difficult to find the four points of the compass, and determining latitude did not cause any problems either.\" (Almgrem){{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBirds provided a helpful guide to finding land. A Viking legend states that Vikings used to take caged crows aboard ships and let them loose if they got lost. The crows would instinctively head for land, giving the sailors a course to steer.\n\n===Propulsion===\n\nThe longships had two methods of propulsion: oars and sail. At sea, the sail enabled longships to travel faster than by oar and to cover long distances overseas with far less manual effort. Sails could be raised or lowered quickly. In a modern facsimile the mast can be lowered in 90 seconds. Oars were used when near the coast or in a river, to gain speed quickly, and when there was an adverse (or insufficient) wind. In combat, the variability of wind power made rowing the chief means of propulsion. The ship was steered by a vertical flat blade with a short round handle, at right angles, mounted over the starboard side of the aft gunwale.\n\nLongships were not fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on sea chests (chests containing their personal possessions) that would otherwise take up space. The chests were made the same size and were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as oarlocks. If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.\n\nAn innovation that improved the sail's performance was the [[beitass]], or stretching pole\u2014a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward performance of the ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking the beitass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached to the luff and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about {{convert|500|to|700|mm|ft|abbr=in}} long on the outside of the hull.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Tapisserie bato1.jpg|thumb|Image from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing [[Harold Godwinson]]'s ship approaching a beach, probably in the Somme Estuary<ref>Wolfgang Grape, The Bayeux Tapestry, Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1365-7}}. p. 95.</ref>]]\nThe Vikings were major contributors to the shipbuilding technology of their day. Their shipbuilding methods spread through extensive contact with other cultures, and ships from the 11th and 12th centuries are known to borrow many of the longships' design features, despite the passing of many centuries. The [[Poveiro (boat)|Lancha Poveira]], a boat from [[P\u00f3voa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]] is one of the last remnants from the longship, keeping all the longboat features but without a long [[stern]] and bow, and with a [[Lateen|lateen sail]]. It was used until the 1950s. Today there is just one boat: ''F\u00e9 em Deus''.\n\nMany historians, archaeologists and adventurers have reconstructed longships in an attempt to understand how they worked.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.havhingsten.dk Sea Stallion from Glendalough 2007]</ref> These re-creators have been able to identify many of the advances that the Vikings implemented in order to make the longship a superior vessel.\n\nThe longship was a master of all trades. It was wide and stable, yet light, fast, and nimble. With all these qualities combined in one ship, the longship was unrivalled for centuries, until the arrival of the great [[Cog (ship)|cog]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the longship was the usual vessel for war even with the introduction of cogs in the 12th\u201313th centuries. [[Leidang]] fleet-levy laws remained in place for most of the Middle Ages, demanding that the freemen should build, man and furnish ships for war if demanded by the king\u2014ships with at least 20 or 25 oar-pairs (40\u201350+ rowers). However, by the late 14th century, these low-boarded vessels were at a disadvantage against newer, taller vessels\u2014when the [[Victual Brothers]], in the employ of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], attacked [[Bergen]] in the autumn of 1393, the \"great ships\" of the pirates could not be boarded by the Norwegian levy ships called out by [[Margaret I of Denmark]], and the raiders were able to sack the town with impunity. While earlier times had seen larger and taller longships in service, by this time the authorities had also gone over to other types of ships for warfare. The last Viking longship was defeated in 1429.\n\n== Notable longships ==\n\n=== Preserved originals ===\nSeveral of the original longships built in the Viking Age have been excavated by archaeologists. A selection of vessels that has been particularly important to our understanding of the longships design and construction, comprise the following:\n\n* The [[Nydam Mose#Nydam Boat|Nydam ship]] (c. 310\u2013320 AD) is a burial ship from Denmark. This oaken vessel is {{convert|80|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} long and was propelled by oars only. No mast is attached, as it was a later addition to the longship design. The Nydam ship shows a combination of building styles and is important to our understanding of the evolution of the early Viking ships.\n* \"''[[Puck 2]]''\" is the name given to a longship found in the [[Bay of Gdansk]] in Poland in 1977. It has been dated to the first half of the 10th century and was 19\u201320 metres long in its day. It is peculiar and important because it was constructed by [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] craftsmen, not Scandinavian. The design only differs very slightly from the Scandinavian built longships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/method/the-archaeological-sources/puck-2-a-slavic-longship/|title=Puck 2 - a Slavic longship |publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n* \"''[[Hedeby 1]]''\" is the name given to a longship found in the harbour of [[Hedeby]] in 1953. At nearly 31 metres long, it is of the Skeid type, built around 985 AD. With a maximum width of just 2.7 metres it has a width-to-length ratio of more than 11, making it the slimmest longship ever discovered. It is made of oaken wood and its construction would have required a very high level of craftsmanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/method/the-archaeological-sources/the-longship-from-haithabu-harbour/|title=The longship from Haithabu Harbour |publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n* The [[Oseberg ship]] and the [[Gokstad ship]] \u2013 both from Vestfold in Norway. They both represent the longship design of the later Viking Age.\n* \"''[[Skuldelev 2]]''\" is the name given to the longest longship ever found at approximately 30 metres. It was discovered in 1996\u201397 at the [[Viking Ship Museum (Roskilde)|Viking Ship Museum]] in Roskilde, Denmark. The ship was built near Dublin around 1042. Longships were constructed progressively longer near the end of the Viking Age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/the-five-viking-ships/skuldelev-2/|title=Skuldelev 2|publisher=Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde |accessdate=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical examples ===\nA selection of important longships known only from written sources includes:\n\n* The [[Ormen Lange (longship)|Ormen Lange]] (\"''The Long Serpent''\") was the most famous longship of Norwegian king [[Olaf Tryggvason]].\n* The [[Mora (ship)|Mora]] was the ship given to [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] by his wife, [[Matilda of Flanders|Matilda]], and used as the flagship in the [[Norman conquest of England]]. It is said to be of the ''drakar'' type.\n* The Mariasuda, flagship of Norwegian king [[King Sverre|Sverre]] at the [[Battle of Fimreite]], the largest recorded longship.\n\n=== Replicas ===\n[[Image:Viking, replica of the Gokstad Viking ship, at the Chicago World Fair 1893.jpg|thumb|A replica of the Gokstad ship, named [[Viking (replica Viking longship)|''Viking'']], was sailed across the Atlantic to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893.]]There are many replicas of Viking ships - including longships - in existence. Some are just inspired by the longship design in general, while others are intricate works of experimental archaeology, trying to replicate the originals as accurately as possible. Replicas important to our understanding of the original longships design and construction include:\n* ''[[Viking (replica Viking longship)|Viking]]'', the very first Viking ship replica, was built by the [[Framn\u00e6s Mekaniske V\u00e6rksted|R\u00f8dsverven shipyard]] in [[Sandefjord, Norway]], modelled after the Gokstad ship. In 1893, it sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Chicago]] in The [[United States]] for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].\n* The Skuldelev replicas. All the five [[Skuldelev ships]] have been replicated, some of them several times. They are each of a different design and only Skuldelev 1, 2 and 5 are longships.\n* The [[Sea Stallion (longship)|Sea Stallion]] is a replica of the Skuldelev 2 ship, constructed by authentic methods. At {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=in}}, it is the second longest Viking ship replica ever made. Skuldelev 2 was originally built near Dublin around 1042, and was rediscovered in Roskilde, Denmark in 1962. The Sea Stallion sailed from Roskilde to Dublin in summer 2007, to commemorate the voyage of the original.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In the winter 2007\u20132008, The Sea Stallion was exhibited outside the National Museum in Dublin. In the summer of 2008, the Sea Stallion returned to Roskilde on a searoute south of England.\n* [[Dragon Harald Fairhair (ship)|Dragon Harald Fairhair]] is the largest longship built in modern times at {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=in}}. The ship is not a replica of any specific original longship, but was built by authentic construction methods. It was constructed in [[Haugesund, Norway]] and launched in 2012.\n* The [[\u00cdslendingur|\u00cdslendingur (Icelander)]] is a {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=in}} replica of the Gokstad ship that was built using traditional building techniques.

While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]], including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann. In 2013, the actor reprised the role in the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", which depicts the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]] (played by [[John Hurt]]).\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien (a [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]]) who [[time travel in fiction|travels in time and space]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]].  At the end of life, the Doctor's body can [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]], but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.\n\nMcGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only companion in the television film is [[Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]), a medical doctor whose surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including self-styled \"Edwardian Adventuress\" [[Charley Pollard|Charley]], the alien [[Destrii]] and present-day humans [[Lucie Miller|Lucie]] and [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Sam]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|thumb|left|A deadly confrontation between the Doctor and the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]].]]\n\nThe Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television film]], the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a [[Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] for a new television series on the [[Fox Network]], the film drew 5.5% of the US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.tv/msg/d12b3e9f2de93c3e?dmode=source|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, it was received well, attracting over 9&nbsp;million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well received in Australia.<ref>''Data Extract'', 121, July/August 1996, and see [[Doctor Who in Australia]].</ref>\n\nAlthough the film failed to spark a new television series, the Eighth Doctor's adventures continued in various licensed [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media, notably [[BBC Books]]' ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' novels, audio plays from [[Big Finish Productions]], and the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip. These stories spanned the nine years between 1996 and the debut of the new television series in 2005. He is the longest-serving Doctor in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip. In the wake of the positive reaction to the revived television series in 2005, several of the Eighth Doctor's Big Finish audio dramas were also broadcast on [[BBC7]] radio in an edited form. The trailers for these broadcasts explained that these adventures took place before the destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the Doctor's homeworld, as described in the revived TV series. In 2007, BBC7 aired a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures, created specifically for radio broadcast. Paul McGann has continued to portray the Eighth Doctor in the various audio spinoffs.\n\nThe [[Whoniverse#Inclusion and continuity|continuity]] of the spin-off media with respect to the television series and to each other is open to interpretation. (The \"Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who\" on the BBC's classic ''Doctor Who'' website suggests this may be due to the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/guide.shtml |title=Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who |accessdate=8 February 2007 |format=[[Adobe Flash|Flash]] required |work=Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC}}</ref> It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama ''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |title=Zagreus |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |work=Doctor Who Reference Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129000300/http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In response, it has become increasingly common to consider the three ranges separately. The final ''Eighth Doctor Adventures'' novel, ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005&nbsp;novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'', obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that the split results in the three alternative forms of the [[Ninth Doctor]] (a reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared in various media). ''Mary's Story'', a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with book companions before audio companions. In \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Doctor \"salutes\" five of his companions by name, all from the Big Finish audio productions.\n\n[[File:Past Doctors section.jpg|thumb|left|The Eighth Doctor appears as a sketch in \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\".]]\n\nDespite the fact the Eighth Doctor appeared on television only twice, he is the most prolific of all the Doctors (to date) in terms of number of individual stories published in novel, novella, short story and audio form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm |title=Doctor Who Reference Guide |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |date=30 January 2007}}</ref> In 2007, the Eighth Doctor finally made a second appearance (of sorts) within the television series' continuity. In the episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" he appears on-screen as a sketch (alongside other incarnations) in the book ''[[List of Doctor Who items#J|A Journal of Impossible Things]]'' by John Smith. In 2008 and 2010 he appeared again as a brief image in \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\" along with every other incarnation up to that time. In 2010's \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\", he is shown in a flashback with his first, second, third, fourth, ninth and tenth incarnations. In 2013's \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\", he is shown in a flashback along with the Doctor's other incarnations; he is also fleetingly seen running past companion [[Clara Oswald]] in the following episode, \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", though his face is not shown. Later that year, McGann reprised the role for the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", a prelude to the show's [[The Day of the Doctor|50th anniversary special]]. This appearance marked the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/video/mini-episode-the-night-of-the-doctor/ | title=The Night of the Doctor | accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> \"The Night of the Doctor\" proved popular with fans of the series, some of whom petitioned the BBC to make a spin-off series starring the Eighth Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/online-petition-new-doctor-who-657189|title=Online Petition for New 'Doctor Who' Spin-Off Tops 9,000 Names|date=18 November 2013|author=Graeme McMillan|publisher=HollywoodReporter.com|work=Heat-vision|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231237/doctor-who-8-reasons-paul-mcganns-eighth-doctor-deserves-a-series|title=Doctor Who: 8 Reasons Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor Deserves a Series|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Ethan Lewis|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231124/doctor-who-petition-for-paul-mcgann-spinoff-passes-15000-signatures|title=Doctor Who: Petition For Paul McGann Spinoff Passes 15,000 Signatures!|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Bridget LaMonica|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nThe BBC's official website calls the Eighth Doctor an \"effortlessly charming, romantic figure\". The site states that he is both unguarded about his own background and candid about the future of those he meets, noting the irony in an \"open Doctor\" remaining such a closed book.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4GLP0JZNhRl46DS6jDX4fMr/the-eighth-doctor|title=The Eighth Doctor|publisher=BBC One|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Big Finish Productions]] website describes the Eighth Doctor as \"an enthusiastic figure who explores the universe for the sheer love of it\", always surviving on the strength of his excellent improvisational skills rather than preparing elaborate plans. The site states that he is \"passionate, direct, sympathetic and emotionally accessible\", but notes that these traits are \"balanced by occasional feelings of self-doubt and weariness of his endless battles against evil.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/released/eighth-doctor-adventures|title=DOCTOR WHO \u2013 EIGHTH DOCTOR ADVENTURES \u2013 RELEASED ITEMS|publisher=Big Finish|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nDiscussing \"The Night of the Doctor\", McGann said, \"[Moffat's] instinctive take on the Eighth Doctor was exactly how I'd imagined this character to be, even way back, back in the 90s. You know, this... like a bruised nobility. I know it sounds wanky now, but... he's decent, but he's compromised. He's not a warrior, really, at all. There's a pacifist side to him, but he's a realist as well.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Benjamin | date=May 2014 |title=Physician, Heal Thyself... |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=472 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Television appearances==\n===TV movie===\nThe Eighth Doctor debuts in the TV film ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]''. While transporting the remains of his longtime nemesis [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] to Gallifrey, the [[Seventh Doctor]] ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) is caught in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out in 1999 [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown, USA]]. He is taken to a hospital where surgeons, confused by his double heartbeat, attempt to correct a non-existent [[fibrillation]]. These efforts instead \"kill\" the Doctor, and he is taken to a morgue where after several hours\u2014due to the effect of anaesthetic on his alien biology\u2014he finally regenerates into his eighth incarnation (McGann). The Master manages to cheat death, and while the Doctor is on Earth his spirit takes over the body of a paramedic named Bruce ([[Eric Roberts]]). The Master (Roberts) then attempts to steal the Doctor's remaining lives by opening the [[Eye of Harmony]] inside the Doctor's time machine, the [[TARDIS]], nearly destroying the Earth in the process. However, the Doctor and his companion [[Grace Holloway|Dr Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]) are able to prevent the Earth's destruction, and the Master is sucked into the Eye.\n\nThe TV film did not lead to the commissioning of a revived television series, and while Eighth Doctor stories continued in other media, ''Doctor Who'' did not air again on television until 2005. After this, footage and stills from the TV film would be used in later episodes \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" (2008), \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\" (both 2010) and \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\" (2013). Edited archive footage in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" very briefly shows the Eighth Doctor sharing an adventure with the [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/ |title=The Name of the Doctor Past References |publisher=The Doctor Who Site News |date= |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Night of the Doctor\"/\"The Day of the Doctor\"===\nMcGann reprised the role for a [[webcast]] mini-episode, \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", in 2013, which precedes the 50th anniversary special, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\". The episode begins during the raging [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] between [[Dalek]]s and Time Lords when he is killed when attempting to save a young woman who rejects salvation at the hands of a Time Lord causing them both to die in a spaceship crash. He awakens in the company of the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#Sisterhood of Karn|Sisterhood of Karn]], who explain that he has died and been temporarily resurrected. They urge him to bring the war to an end, and give him a choice of elixirs to trigger his regeneration. Saluting his various companions from the Big Finish audio range, he drinks an elixir designed to produce a warrior, regenerating into the [[War Doctor]] ([[John Hurt]]) who declares himself to be the Doctor \"no more.\" In \"The Day of the Doctor,\" the Eighth Doctor joins all of the other incarnations of the Doctor in saving Gallifrey at the end of the Time War. He can be briefly seen on a screen in the War Room, though like the other past incarnations of the Doctor, this is achieved through archive footage.\n\n==Costumes==\n\n=== Original TV Movie costume ===\n\nThe Eighth Doctor initially wore a [[Wild Bill Hickok]] costume including a battleship grey [[cravat]] tie intended for a New Year's fancy dress party, which he liberated from the lockers at the San Francisco hospital he regenerated in. He completed it with a pair of black leather shoes taken from Grace Holloway's ex-boyfriend Brian to give him the appearance somewhere between a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] dandy and [[wild west]] gambler.\n\n=== Costume during the Time War ===\n\nBy the time of \"The Night of the Doctor\" he sported a worn and bottle green [[moleskin]] [[overcoat]], a ruffled and midnight-blue [[ascot tie]], a bronze grey [[paisley (design)|paisley]] [[waistcoat]], [[leather]] [[gaiters]], and caramel brown [[US Cavalry|US Army Cavalry]] boots...corresponding with his overall weary appearance, presumably as a result of many experiences during the Time War.\n\n=== Big Finish costume ===\nIn 2010, Paul McGann revealed a new costume and [[sonic screwdriver]] for the Eighth Doctor which he indicated would be the new costume going forward. The cover and promotional photographs for the 2012 Big Finish story, ''Dark Eyes'' is, however, the first story to officially feature the new costume. The new outfit was originally premiered in 2010 at the [[Armageddon (convention)|Armageddon Pop Culture Expo]], along with a redesigned Sonic Screwdriver, courtesy of [[Weta Workshop]]. These changes were independently produced and were not affiliated with Big Finish Productions or the BBC, but were accepted as suitable for official use after the fact.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url= http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2010/10/new-eighth-doctor-costume-revealed.html\n | title= New Eighth Doctor costume revealed\n | first= Doctor Who\n | last= News\n | publisher=\n}}\n</ref>\nThe costume consists of a royal blue leather [[pea coat]], a white [[T-shirt]], navy blue [[jeans]] and brown shoes. In this outfit the Doctor also carries a brown [[messenger bag]].\n\n==Spin-off appearances==\n\n===Novels===\nAlmost as soon as he'd left San Francisco, the Doctor had another brief attack of amnesia, caused by a final trap of the Master's. To regain his memories, the Doctor was forced to visit all seven of his past selves and help them out with some crisis or another, at the same time acknowledging the responsibility his role gave him. Having regained his memories, the Doctor met a late twentieth-century [[Coal Hill School]] student named [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Samantha Jones]]; shortly after their encounter, the Doctor left her alone at a [[Greenpeace]] rally.\n\nFor a time, the Doctor adventured with an [[Ice Warrior]] named [[Ssard]] and a human woman named [[Stacy Townsend]], who fell in love with each other; some while after they parted ways with the Doctor, the two invited him to serve as best man at their wedding (''[[Placebo Effect (novel)|Placebo Effect]]''). He also, at some point, teamed up with his old companion [[Bernice Summerfield]], [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] and [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] to combat [[The Dying Days|an Ice Warrior occupation of Great Britain]].\n\n====Faction Paradox====\nEventually, three years after his departure and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great war, looming in the future of Gallifrey, [[Time War (Doctor Who)#Eighth Doctor Adventures|between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy]], with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the issue of the war, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (''[[Alien Bodies]]''). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could make more of a difference with him.\n\nThe close dynamic between the pair was shifted with the introduction of [[Fitz Kreiner]], a sixties bar singer incorrectly suspected of matricide. Fitz took on the role of a sort of younger brother to the Doctor, placing the Time Lord on as high a pedestal as Fitz had ever known. Eventually Fitz found himself abducted by [[Faction Paradox]], a \"time-travelling voodoo cult\", and brainwashed into their legions. When the Doctor realised that a Faction member he had encountered was a biomass copy of Fitz- a 'clone' created and shaped based on others' memories and perceptions of Fitz-, he used the TARDIS's telepathic circuits to restore Fitz's memories and identity to the clone, believing that the original Fitz was dead and reasoning that the clone would essentially be the real Fitz in every way that mattered.\n\nWith both Sam and Fitz gone \u2013 Sam's origins established as a temporal paradox caused by exposure to a scar in reality created when the Doctor regenerated, which the 'original' Sam was only exposed to because the Doctor met blonde Sam \u2013 the Doctor continued his travels with the clone Fitz (although he was treated as the real one and generally thought of himself as such) and [[Compassion (Doctor Who)|Compassion]], an ex-Faction agent implanted with an interface that the Doctor found compatible with his TARDIS. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, the Faction \u2013 with the aid of the original Fitz \u2013 had changed his history, drawing the [[Third Doctor]] to a planet he should never have visited and causing a chain of events that culminated in the Third Doctor regenerating ahead of schedule, allowing them to infect him with the Faction Paradox biodata virus. While his immune system would allow him to resist the virus for a time, it would gain a greater hold on him with each subsequent regeneration, until it would finally transform him into a faction member in his eighth incarnation (''[[Interference: Book One]] and [[Interference: Book Two|Two]]'').\n\nEventually, Compassion's implant, linked to the Doctor's TARDIS to prevent her being influenced by random local signals, triggered her unexpected mutation into a sentient Type 102 TARDIS, specifically the \"mother\" of the TARDISes that would be used in the pending War. With this knowledge, the Time Lords \u2013 led by [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]], now in her third incarnation \u2013 attempted to capture Compassion, intending to use her as breeding stock in preparation for the war. In response, and in light of the apparent destruction of his old TARDIS in a dimensional rift, the Doctor and Fitz retreated into Compassion and fled, the Doctor refusing to let his people enslave his friend in such a manner and resolving to keep on the run until he could find another way to deal with the issue of the War (''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]'').\n\nThe Doctor and Fitz travelled in Compassion for some time, until the machinations of Faction Paradox came to a head back on Gallifrey. As it turned out, in the new timeline triggered by the Doctor's infection, the Doctor was destined to become \"[[Grandfather Paradox (Doctor Who)|Grandfather Paradox]]\", the mythical founder of Faction Paradox. The only factor keeping the original sequence of events in play was the Doctor's TARDIS, which had rebuilt itself after its apparent destruction on Avalon, and had now materialised in a twisted form above Gallifrey, holding within itself the Doctor's original reality where he had regenerated on Metebelis III and never been infected ever since it sensed that something was wrong when the Third Doctor regenerated ahead of schedule.\n\nIn a final confrontation with his future self, the Doctor resolved the timeline conflict by channelling the TARDIS's built-up energies through its weapon systems, thereby destroying both the Faction Paradox fleet and Gallifrey itself. In so doing, the TARDIS was able to rewrite the altered timeline with the original one that it \"remembered\"; no longer able to contain both timelines as a result of its energy drain, one reality had to become 'real'. As a side effect, however, the Doctor's entire memory was erased, apparently from the trauma of the event (''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'').\n\n====Amnesia on Earth====\nTo give the Doctor time to recover and the TARDIS time to regenerate from the extensive damage it had suffered, Compassion dropped the Doctor off on Earth in the year 1889; she then delivered Fitz to 2001, with the intent that he wait for the Doctor to catch up to him. With that, Compassion departed for parts unknown. Back in 1889, meanwhile, the Doctor awoke in a railway carriage to discover no memory as to his real identity, and no possessions save a small, shapeless box\u2013 what was left of the TARDIS after its power loss\u2014 and a note, simply stating \"Meet me in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]', 8 February 2001. Fitz\".\n\nDespite his amnesia, the Doctor retained a wide general knowledge. However, he also showed an uncharacteristic callous streak, easily allowing others to die if he felt that they 'deserved' to perish (''[[The Burning (Doctor Who)|The Burning]]''). To contrast, he was capable of feeling unusually poignant warmth, even dating a woman in the 1980s, and adopting a young girl named [[Miranda (Doctor Who)|Miranda]], a Time Lady from the future (''[[Father Time (Doctor Who)|Father Time]]''). During this time, he often became involved in strange problems outside the norm, such as confronting an entity that was essentially sentient fire (''[[The Burning (novel)|The Burning]]''). He experienced a particular funk in the 1950s, feeling that his efforts to learn about his past were pointless, but his interest in life was re-inspired when he was recruited to defeat his old enemies the Players as they sought to escalate the Cold War (''[[Endgame (Doctor Who)|Endgame]]'').\n\nUnsure what \"St Louis\" was intended by the note, the Doctor created his own in London: the St Louis Bar and Restaurant. As 2001 rolled around, Fitz indeed turned up there to meet him. With the aid of new companion [[Anji Kapoor]], the Doctor and Fitz completed the TARDIS's regeneration, dealt with a race of invading aliens, then set back again to exploring time and space (''[[Escape Velocity (Doctor Who)|Escape Velocity]]'').\n\nWith his freedom restored, the Doctor chose to counteract his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered all manner of unusual beings \u2013 from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (''[[The Year of Intelligent Tigers]]''), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold \u2013 as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (''[[Eater of Wasps]]'') \u2013 he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever had happened to him had happened for a reason, and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered.\n\n====Sabbath and parallel times====\nOnly a few months after resuming his old lifestyle, the Doctor faced another radical change: the loss of his second heart.  As it happened, the heart served as a bond with Gallifrey; with the planet gone, the heart had begun to fester within the Doctor's body, pumping it with poison.\n\nA man named [[Sabbath (Doctor Who)|Sabbath]], an eighteenth-century secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor of some of his higher Time Lord abilities, including his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins. It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers, including allowing Sabbath to travel further from Earth in his own time machine than he had previously been capable of. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm, returning to life after up to a day in a death-like state even after sustaining normally regeneration-inducing injuries such as getting his chest crushed by sandbags (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath).\n\nEventually, after a woman Sabbath loved sacrificed herself to save the Doctor from a malfunctioning time machine, Sabbath tore out the Doctor's second heart, allowing the Doctor to begin growing a new one.\n\nShortly after the restoration of his heart, the Doctor found himself locked in a desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show up, and that the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One \u2013 the [[Big Bang]] \u2013 that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating a plan that would effectively wipe out free will itself, with the Doctor proving that Sabbath's perception was wrong when they found themselves in a situation that could only have occurred due to time travel in a single timeline.\n\nThe explosion at Event One was averted when the Doctor diverted the black light that would have triggered the explosion to 1898, but instead of reality collapsing into a single controllable timeline, what occurred was reality starting to 'slide' between histories, multiple parallel realities fighting to become the dominant one. Along with new companion [[Trix MacMillan|Trix]], the Doctor, Fitz and Anji travelled through the realities, including a world where the computer was never invented, a world where Earth was devastated by a strange even as all life aged forty years in 1843, and a world where humanity had time-travelling tours, with the Doctor being forced to erase at least two of these realities as he sought to restore the original timeline. During this adventure, the Doctor appeared to become a bit more cold and calculating, sacrificing an innocent man to escape a pocket universe and even leaving alternate versions of Fitz and Anji to die to preserve continuity. However, in the end, their sacrifices paid off, the Doctor managing to stabilise reality by resolving a paradox that had been hanging over them since the beginning of the crisis, and then, with Sabbath's help, they confronted his masters; the Council of Eight, mysterious beings who gained power by foreseeing likely future events and then ensuring that they came to pass. The Doctor, as a rogue element existing outside of Time, was the only unpredictable factor in their universe, and was thus the only person who could stop them. Ironically, it was Sabbath himself who gave the Doctor the edge needed to stop the Council; realising that one of the Council members expected Sabbath to shoot the Council member with a weapon designed to send the subject into the Time Vortex, Sabbath instead shot himself, condemning himself to eternal agony in the Time Vortex, but completely undoing the Council's plan and destroying their space station, simultaneously restoring the possibility of parallel worlds to the universe.\n\n====''The Gallifrey Chronicles''====\nSome while after this, the Doctor was captured by Marnal, one of the few surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005 novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.\n\n===Audio dramas===\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|date=June 2017|\n {{Cleanup-tense|section|present|date=April 2014}}\n}}\nPaul McGann first returned to his role as the Eighth Doctor in ''[[Storm Warning (audio drama)|Storm Warning]]'', the first in a series of audio plays, in which the Doctor lands on Earth in October 1930 aboard the doomed [[R101]] airship. Aboard the vessel, the Doctor meets a young adventuress called [[Charley Pollard]] (played by [[India Fisher]]). In the course of his adventure, the Doctor saves Charley's life and takes her aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. This was done in good faith, but the Doctor soon learns that Charley's rescue greatly and negatively effected the timestream.\n\nDespite established in-universe history partly relying upon her death on the R101, the Doctor is unable to return her to preserve the timeline, with Charley's continued existence forming a rough plot arc over two \"seasons\" of audio adventures as the Doctor discovers a series of minor historical anomalies caused by the damage to the timeline, such as the CIA existing in 1933 or [[Benjamin Franklin]] being president. The Doctor eventually learns that, due to Charley's survival, the universe has become infected with \"anti-time,\" leading to a conflict with the wraith-like Never People- individuals who were erased from history for crimes against reality and now seek to unleash the destructive anti-time against the universe- with the resolution of this conflict depicting the Doctor choosing to sacrifice himself and his TARDIS by absorbing anti-time energy, which seals the rift and preserves Charley's life but transforms him into the bogeyman Zagreus. Later restored to sanity but still infected with anti-time through the actions of Charley, his old companions Leela and Romana, and recreations of his immediate three preceding incarnations, the Doctor chooses again to sacrifice himself for the sake of Charley and the universe by removing himself from space and time. He enters a divergent universe for which he has no prior knowledge or frame of reference and in which there is no concept of linear time (''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''). Meanwhile, Charley stows away on his TARDIS, in a sense nullifying the Doctor's sacrifice by again placing herself in danger; for a time, this fact causes great friction between the characters and personal angst for the Doctor.\n\nFor another two seasons, the Doctor, Charley, and a new companion by the name of [[C'rizz]], explore the divergent universe, gradually unravelling a deep plot designed around the Doctor by [[Rassilon]], founder of Time Lord society, who had previously been trapped in anti-time by the Doctor for his role in the creation of Zagreus. Eventually, with the aid of his companions, the Doctor escapes the trap built for him, overcomes his emotional burden, learns that he has been purged of Zagreus, and returns to his normal universe with Charley and C'rizz (''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]'').\n\nFollowing that point, which coincided with the end of the official Big Finish \"seasons\" in light of the return of ''Doctor Who'' to television in 2005, the trio wanders freely. The only continuing plot element involved C'rizz, whose character exhibits unusual and potentially destructive psychological development. This development culminates in C'rizz's death (''[[Absolution (Doctor Who)|Absolution]]''), which inspires in Charley a desire to leave the Doctor's company. Due to amnesia brought on by a healing coma induced by a cyber-planner, the Eighth Doctor believes Charley has left him in 2008 [[Singapore]] (''[[The Girl Who Never Was]]''), when she is in fact displaced into the year 500,002, whence she is rescued by the [[Sixth Doctor]] (''[[The Condemned (Doctor Who audio)|The Condemned]]''). Believing that the Eighth Doctor died before their parting, Charley thus spends some time travelling with the Sixth Doctor, but their time together ends when an alien race called the Viyrans replace his memories of Charley with another woman, Mila, to preserve the timeline.\n\nStarting New Year's Eve 2006, a new audio series titled ''[[The Eighth Doctor Adventures (audio drama series)|The Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' featuring the Doctor and new companion [[Lucie Miller]] (played by [[Sheridan Smith]]) was broadcast on BBC7. A second series followed in 2007. A third season was streamed from the Big Finish website, and was available on CD. A fourth and final season started in 2009 with the Christmas episode ''[[Death in Blackpool]]'' which dealt with Lucie's departure. Also in December 2009, the standalone episode ''[[An Earthly Child]]'' was released, in which the Doctor visits his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] on Earth (following up on the events of the [[First Doctor]] adventure ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'') and meets his great-grandson Alex Campbell. In ''[[Situation Vacant]]'' the Doctor gains a new companion, [[Tamsin Drew]] \u2013 drawn from four prospective companions. This season puts the Eighth Doctor up against a new incarnation of [[The Monk (Doctor Who)|the Meddling Monk]], now travelling with Lucie Miller, but in the course of the season Tamsin is seduced to the Meddling Monk's way of thinking while Lucie finds the Monk's violence distasteful and re-joins the Doctor. When the Monk helps the Daleks launch an invasion of Earth, Tamsin, Lucie, and Alex are killed driving them off, although at the last minute the Monk betrays the Daleks to help save the Doctor and Susan.\n\nIn November 2012 Big Finish released a boxed set of four audio dramas called ''[[Dark Eyes (audio drama)|Dark Eyes]]'', whose stories take place after ''[[To the Death (audio drama)|To the Death]]''. The set also introduced a new companion, [[Molly O'Sullivan]] (played by [[Ruth Bradley]]), an Irish [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] nursing assistant in [[World War I]]. Here the Eighth Doctor changes his appearance, cutting his hair and changing into a WWI navy trench coat after his Victorian clothing is ruined.\n\nAn [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]] version of the Eighth Doctor, from a timeline where the Seventh Doctor regenerates after being shot by the Nazis in the 1950s, was first mentioned in the audio drama ''[[Colditz (audio drama)|Colditz]]'', and appears (played by McGann) in ''[[Survival of the Fittest & Klein\u2019s Story#Klein\u2019s Story|Klein's Story]]''. Under the alias \"Schmidt,\" the Doctor teaches [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Klein|Klein]] how to pilot the TARDIS, thereby putting her in a position to inadvertently assist the Seventh Doctor in preventing this timeline from occurring (unable to go back himself as the TARDIS security protocols would prevent him from going somewhere where he was already).\n\nIn a trilogy of adventures, released in October through December 2011 as part of Big Finish's continuing monthly range, The Doctor travels with [[Mary Shelley (Doctor Who)|Mary Shelley]] (as played by [[Julie Cox]]), first acknowledged as a friend of the Eighth Doctor's in ''[[The Company of Friends]]''. The first story, ''[[The Silver Turk]]'', features the early breed of the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as seen in ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[The Witch from the Well]]'' tests the pair's relationship, and the trilogy concludes with ''[[Army of Death]]''.\n\nIn 2013, Big Finish released a special 50th Anniversary story, ''The Light at the End'', in which the Master ([[Geoffrey Beevers]]) implements a plot to trap and destroy all eight incarnations of the Doctor by keeping him on Gallifrey. The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor ([[Tom Baker]]) and Leela ([[Louise Jameson]]), the Fifth Doctor ([[Peter Davison]]) and Nyssa ([[Sarah Sutton]]), the Sixth Doctor ([[Colin Baker]]) and Peri, and the Seventh Doctor ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) and Ace ([[Sophie Aldred]]). Working together with the First Doctor ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), Second Doctor ([[Frazer Hines]]), and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), they manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions [[Susan Foreman|Susan]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]), [[Steven Taylor (Doctor Who)|Steven Taylor]] ([[Peter Purves]]), [[Sara Kingdom]] ([[Jean Marsh]]), [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] ([[Anneke Wills]]), [[Jamie McCrimmon]] ([[Frazer Hines]]), [[Zoe Heriot]] ([[Wendy Padbury]]), [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]), [[Tegan Jovanka]] ([[Janet Fielding]]), and [[Vislor Turlough|Turlough]] ([[Mark Strickson]]) also made appearances in the audio drama.\n\nIn the 2013 live action mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\", the Eighth Doctor saluted Charley, C'rizz, Lucie, Tamsin and Molly from the Big Finish range prior to his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first ''Dark Eyes'' boxed set, Big Finish released three more sets, continuing Molly's story and introducing [[Liv Chenka]] as a new companion (Chenka having previously met the Seventh Doctor in the audio ''Robophobia''). The Eighth Doctor goes on to appear in a four-CD, four-part miniseries, ''Doom Coalition'', which sees him, Liv, and new companion Helen Sinclair on the hunt for the insane Time Lord known as the Eleven, who suffers from a unique mental defect where all of his past personalities are active in his mind at once. In the course of the series, the Doctor peripherally interacts with the [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s future wife [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] (although she takes care to avoid directly interacting with the Eighth Doctor unless disguised) and at one point confronts an alliance between the Monk and the [[Weeping Angels]]. ''Doom Coalition'' concludes with the Doctor thwarting the plans of the titular Coalition, who are revealed to be a group of Time Lords led by the Doctor's old schoolfriend Padrac, with Padrac's latest consultations with the Matrix having driven him to the conclusion that the only way to save Gallifrey from 'prophecies' of its own destruction is to destroy the rest of the universe.\n\nBeginning in 2017, Big Finish began releasing two separate Eighth Doctor series of box sets in the form of ''Ravenous'' and ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War''. ''Ravenous'' is a series of four four-part box sets that serve as a direct sequel to ''Doom Coalition'', initially depicting the Doctor and Liv's efforts to find Helen after she is trapped with the Eleven, but subsequently progresses to depict their efforts to oppose the Ravenous, an ancient race who are essentially the natural predator of the Time Lords as they evolved to feed on the energy released when Time Lords regenerate (the Ravenous are described as being the reason humans fear clowns, as they essentially resemble clowns in their natural state). The series concludes with the Doctor indirectly working with three different incarnations of the Master- including the Master of the TV movie, the War Master and Missy, the latter two of whom do not meet the Doctor face-to-face- to essentially restore the Ravenous to their original state, having determined that they drain energy from Time Lords after an ancient Gallifreyan scientist accidentally stole much of their natural energy millennia ago. ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War'' is another series of four four-part box sets, set later in the Eighth Doctor's life during the early days of the Time War, depicting his efforts to protect those caught in the crossfire with the aid of his new companion Bliss, whose planet's history was undone when a Time Lord agent turned her planet into a weapons depot while her own history is in chaos due to the side-effects of the Time War. The third volume of ''Time War'' also sees the Doctor forced to face the [[Valeyard]] once again when his other self is recreated due to the Doctor being exposed to biology-manipulating technology while using a transmat, the two technologies somehow manifesting a new version of the Valeyard from the transmat after the Doctor departs.\n\n===Comic strips===\n\n====Unfinished business====\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strips, at an unstated time after his regeneration (and after an adventure in the 1930s involving [[Fey Truscott-Sade]] and psychic weasels), the Doctor revisited the town of Stockbridge. After being caught up in the games of the [[Celestial Toymaker]], he picked up a new companion in lively sci-fi fan [[Izzy Sinclair]]. The two of them were soon caught up in the machinations of the Doctor's old enemies the Threshold, a mercenary organisation. The Threshold attempted to manipulate the Doctor into stopping the Daleks gaining access to the multiverse (which would kill an artificial solar system as a side effect) and dying in the attempt, but were outmaneuvered. Unknown to him, they implanted a device in Fey Truscott-Sade so that they could use her as an unwilling spy when she next encountered the Doctor. She did so in 1939, assisting him and Izzy against the vampiric Varney; the Doctor was left infected with a deadly bacillus, and he had to be taken to Gallifrey to be cured, luring him into a battle against a Time Lord cult called the Final Chapter.\n\nWorking out that the Threshold were using Fey as a spy, the Doctor and his old comrade [[Shayde]] faked a regeneration. The Threshold was conned into believing they were facing a vulnerable new Doctor (Shayde in disguise), allowing the real Doctor to infiltrate their base. While he and his friends were too late to stop the Threshold from destroying every single spacecraft in the universe, they were able to bring about the organisation's destruction before it could profit. Fey returned to her time, having also bonded with Shayde to save his life.\n\nUnknowingly, the TARDIS had been taken over by the Master, who was manipulating events to gain the power of the omniversal Glory. The Doctor was specifically sent to times and places that would undermine him \u2013 discovering he had upset the course of Grace Holloway's life in 2001, encountering an alien race with motivations uncomfortably similar to his which caused death and horror in 17th Century Japan, and almost killing the benevolent [[Kroton (Cyberman)|Kroton]] by mistake. (A slight diversion between events saw the Doctor and Izzy team up with the actor [[Tom Baker]] and other 1970s television actors against [[Beep the Meep]] in 1979.)\n\nIn 17th Century Japan, the Doctor's attempt to save the life of samurai Katsura Sato, a friend of Izzy, left the man inadvertently immortal and thus robbed of both an honourable death and any sense of empathy. The Master later came for Sato, when he was mentally vulnerable, and gave him a fake religion to focus his mind on; Earth's history was altered as Sato, renamed Lord Morningstar, and his Church of the Glorious Dead conquered the planet, creating a technological advanced, highly brutal planet of jihadists. The Doctor, Izzy and Kroton wandered into their invasion of the museum planet Paradost; while the Doctor faced the Master over the Glory, Izzy and Kroton spent weeks on the occupied world. The Doctor was defeated, only for the Master discover he was not able to access the Glory, as instead Kroton and Sato had been the ones prophesied to battle for it. Kroton won the Glory, the Master was purged from the TARDIS and history was reverted, and the Doctor and Izzy took a well-earned break.\n\n====Destrii====\n\nDuring a battle against the body-stealing Ophidians and their gigantic snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called [[Destrii]]. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in coming to terms with the change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. [[Frida Kahlo]] helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the humanised Daleks he had created in his [[Evil of the Daleks|second incarnation]]. Unable to prevent their tragic end \u2013 self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, the two of them were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy-beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii.\n\nThe Doctor went on a relentless search to rescue his friend, with the help of Fey/Shayde and by forcing co-operation from Destrii, still alive in her stolen body. His quest led him to the planet Oblivion, a surreal and brutal world ruled by Destrii's mother, the Matriax. Izzy was rescued and returned to her original form, while Oblivion's court system and the menace of the Horde were both destroyed, leaving Destrii free to leave her world and explore the universe with her roguish uncle Jodafra. However, Izzy had decided she wanted to return home to her family, and the Doctor was left alone.\n\nFeeling slightly morose, the Doctor was cheered up by an unknowing encounter with his old companion [[Frobisher (Doctor Who)|Frobisher]] and went on several 'holiday' adventures on his own. He eventually re-encountered Destrii and Jodafra in America during the 19th Century, where the upcoming clash between [[General Custer]] and [[Chief Sitting Bull]] was interrupted by Jodafra's machinations involving the monstrous [[wendigo]]. Jodafra had made a deal with the creature: power in exchange for being fed children. Unable to stomach this and with the Doctor urging her to listen to the spark of decency in her, Destrii helped the Doctor stop her uncle. In revenge, she was left beaten and abandoned, and the Doctor took her in as a probationary companion. Together, the two of them teamed up with [[MI6]] and faced an invasion of early 21st Century Earth by time-travelling [[Cybermen]]; they were preparing to chemically overload the emotions of humans and thus make them willingly surrender to have their emotions removed by conversion. The Doctor destroyed them through use of the Time Vortex (similar to the later \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\"), almost surrendering to it but giving up its power to save Destrii.\n\nIn 2007, [[Panini Books]] published ''Doctor Who: The Flood'', the final collection of comic strips featuring the Eighth Doctor in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. The book includes the essay \"Flood Barriers\" by strip editor Clayton Hickman in which he reveals that [[Russell T Davies]] had authorised the comic strip to depict the regeneration of the Eighth Doctor into the [[Ninth Doctor]] at the end of the 2004\u20132005 arc, ''The Flood''. The cause of the regeneration would have been the Doctor's exposure to the Time Vortex in his efforts to destroy the Cybermen (the same cause that triggered the later Ninth to [[Tenth Doctor]] regeneration in ''Parting of the Ways''). Destrii would have witnessed the regeneration and would have continued to travel with the Ninth Doctor in a proposed ''Year One'' arc. However [[BBC Wales]] vetoed the ''Year One'' arc and indicated the Ninth Doctor could only be shown travelling with [[Rose Tyler]], Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually decided not to depict the regeneration as they would have been unable to give Destrii a proper departure. The Panini collection includes the original script for the regeneration sequence, as well as never before published art showing the regeneration itself.<ref>{{Cite book\n\n|last=\n|first=\n|author2=\n|year=2007\n|title=Doctor Who: The Flood \u2013 The Complete Eighth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 4\n|location=London\n|publisher=[[Panini Books]]\n|isbn=978-1-905239-65-8\n|pages=216\u2013223\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor''===\nIn the ''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor'' comic series, the Eighth Doctor \u2013 from a point shortly before the Time War, as he is shown in the clothing and hairstyle he wore in \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" \u2013 is visiting an old holiday house of his where he encounters a young painter named Josie Day.

He is portrayed by [[Paul McGann]].\n\nThe character was introduced in the 1996 TV film ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]'', a [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|back-door pilot]] produced in an unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the series following its 1989 cancellation. While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]], including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann. In 2013, the actor reprised the role in the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", which depicts the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]] (played by [[John Hurt]]).\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien (a [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]]) who [[time travel in fiction|travels in time and space]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]].  At the end of life, the Doctor's body can [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]], but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.\n\nMcGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only companion in the television film is [[Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]), a medical doctor whose surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including self-styled \"Edwardian Adventuress\" [[Charley Pollard|Charley]], the alien [[Destrii]] and present-day humans [[Lucie Miller|Lucie]] and [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Sam]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|thumb|left|A deadly confrontation between the Doctor and the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]].]]\n\nThe Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television film]], the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a [[Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] for a new television series on the [[Fox Network]], the film drew 5.5% of the US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.tv/msg/d12b3e9f2de93c3e?dmode=source|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, it was received well, attracting over 9&nbsp;million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well received in Australia.<ref>''Data Extract'', 121, July/August 1996, and see [[Doctor Who in Australia]].</ref>\n\nAlthough the film failed to spark a new television series, the Eighth Doctor's adventures continued in various licensed [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media, notably [[BBC Books]]' ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' novels, audio plays from [[Big Finish Productions]], and the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip. These stories spanned the nine years between 1996 and the debut of the new television series in 2005. He is the longest-serving Doctor in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip. In the wake of the positive reaction to the revived television series in 2005, several of the Eighth Doctor's Big Finish audio dramas were also broadcast on [[BBC7]] radio in an edited form. The trailers for these broadcasts explained that these adventures took place before the destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the Doctor's homeworld, as described in the revived TV series. In 2007, BBC7 aired a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures, created specifically for radio broadcast. Paul McGann has continued to portray the Eighth Doctor in the various audio spinoffs.\n\nThe [[Whoniverse#Inclusion and continuity|continuity]] of the spin-off media with respect to the television series and to each other is open to interpretation. (The \"Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who\" on the BBC's classic ''Doctor Who'' website suggests this may be due to the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/guide.shtml |title=Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who |accessdate=8 February 2007 |format=[[Adobe Flash|Flash]] required |work=Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC}}</ref> It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama ''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |title=Zagreus |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |work=Doctor Who Reference Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129000300/http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In response, it has become increasingly common to consider the three ranges separately. The final ''Eighth Doctor Adventures'' novel, ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005&nbsp;novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'', obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that the split results in the three alternative forms of the [[Ninth Doctor]] (a reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared in various media). ''Mary's Story'', a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with book companions before audio companions. In \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Doctor \"salutes\" five of his companions by name, all from the Big Finish audio productions.\n\n[[File:Past Doctors section.jpg|thumb|left|The Eighth Doctor appears as a sketch in \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\".]]\n\nDespite the fact the Eighth Doctor appeared on television only twice, he is the most prolific of all the Doctors (to date) in terms of number of individual stories published in novel, novella, short story and audio form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm |title=Doctor Who Reference Guide |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |date=30 January 2007}}</ref> In 2007, the Eighth Doctor finally made a second appearance (of sorts) within the television series' continuity. In the episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" he appears on-screen as a sketch (alongside other incarnations) in the book ''[[List of Doctor Who items#J|A Journal of Impossible Things]]'' by John Smith. In 2008 and 2010 he appeared again as a brief image in \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\" along with every other incarnation up to that time. In 2010's \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\", he is shown in a flashback with his first, second, third, fourth, ninth and tenth incarnations. In 2013's \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\", he is shown in a flashback along with the Doctor's other incarnations; he is also fleetingly seen running past companion [[Clara Oswald]] in the following episode, \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", though his face is not shown. Later that year, McGann reprised the role for the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", a prelude to the show's [[The Day of the Doctor|50th anniversary special]]. This appearance marked the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/video/mini-episode-the-night-of-the-doctor/ | title=The Night of the Doctor | accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> \"The Night of the Doctor\" proved popular with fans of the series, some of whom petitioned the BBC to make a spin-off series starring the Eighth Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/online-petition-new-doctor-who-657189|title=Online Petition for New 'Doctor Who' Spin-Off Tops 9,000 Names|date=18 November 2013|author=Graeme McMillan|publisher=HollywoodReporter.com|work=Heat-vision|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231237/doctor-who-8-reasons-paul-mcganns-eighth-doctor-deserves-a-series|title=Doctor Who: 8 Reasons Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor Deserves a Series|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Ethan Lewis|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231124/doctor-who-petition-for-paul-mcgann-spinoff-passes-15000-signatures|title=Doctor Who: Petition For Paul McGann Spinoff Passes 15,000 Signatures!|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Bridget LaMonica|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nThe BBC's official website calls the Eighth Doctor an \"effortlessly charming, romantic figure\".

He is taken to a hospital where surgeons, confused by his double heartbeat, attempt to correct a non-existent [[fibrillation]]. These efforts instead \"kill\" the Doctor, and he is taken to a morgue where after several hours\u2014due to the effect of anaesthetic on his alien biology\u2014he finally regenerates into his eighth incarnation (McGann). The Master manages to cheat death, and while the Doctor is on Earth his spirit takes over the body of a paramedic named Bruce ([[Eric Roberts]]). The Master (Roberts) then attempts to steal the Doctor's remaining lives by opening the [[Eye of Harmony]] inside the Doctor's time machine, the [[TARDIS]], nearly destroying the Earth in the process. However, the Doctor and his companion [[Grace Holloway|Dr Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]) are able to prevent the Earth's destruction, and the Master is sucked into the Eye.\n\nThe TV film did not lead to the commissioning of a revived television series, and while Eighth Doctor stories continued in other media, ''Doctor Who'' did not air again on television until 2005. After this, footage and stills from the TV film would be used in later episodes \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" (2008), \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\" (both 2010) and \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\" (2013). Edited archive footage in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" very briefly shows the Eighth Doctor sharing an adventure with the [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/ |title=The Name of the Doctor Past References |publisher=The Doctor Who Site News |date= |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Night of the Doctor\"/\"The Day of the Doctor\"===\nMcGann reprised the role for a [[webcast]] mini-episode, \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", in 2013, which precedes the 50th anniversary special, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\". The episode begins during the raging [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] between [[Dalek]]s and Time Lords when he is killed when attempting to save a young woman who rejects salvation at the hands of a Time Lord causing them both to die in a spaceship crash. He awakens in the company of the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#Sisterhood of Karn|Sisterhood of Karn]], who explain that he has died and been temporarily resurrected. They urge him to bring the war to an end, and give him a choice of elixirs to trigger his regeneration. Saluting his various companions from the Big Finish audio range, he drinks an elixir designed to produce a warrior, regenerating into the [[War Doctor]] ([[John Hurt]]) who declares himself to be the Doctor \"no more.\" In \"The Day of the Doctor,\" the Eighth Doctor joins all of the other incarnations of the Doctor in saving Gallifrey at the end of the Time War. He can be briefly seen on a screen in the War Room, though like the other past incarnations of the Doctor, this is achieved through archive footage.\n\n==Costume==\nThe Eighth Doctor initially wore a [[Wild Bill Hickok]] costume including a battleship grey [[cravat]] tie intended for a New Year's fancy dress party, which he liberated from the lockers at the San Francisco hospital he regenerated in. He completed it with a pair of black leather shoes taken from Grace Holloway's ex-boyfriend Brian to give him the appearance somewhere between a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] dandy and [[wild west]] gambler. By the time of \"The Night of the Doctor\" he sported a worn and bottle green [[moleskin]] [[overcoat]], a ruffled and midnight-blue [[ascot tie]], a bronze grey [[paisley (design)|paisley]] [[waistcoat]], [[leather]] [[gaiters]], and caramel brown [[US Cavalry|US Army Cavalry]] boots...corresponding with his overall weary appearance, presumably as a result of many experiences during the Time War.\n\n=== Big Finish costume ===\nIn 2010, Paul McGann revealed a new costume and [[sonic screwdriver]] for the Eighth Doctor which he indicated would be the new costume going forward. The cover and promotional photographs for the 2012 Big Finish story, ''Dark Eyes'' is, however, the first story to officially feature the new costume. The new outfit was originally premiered in 2010 at the [[Armageddon (convention)|Armageddon Pop Culture Expo]], along with a redesigned Sonic Screwdriver, courtesy of [[Weta Workshop]]. These changes were independently produced and were not affiliated with Big Finish Productions or the BBC, but were accepted as suitable for official use after the fact.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url= http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2010/10/new-eighth-doctor-costume-revealed.html\n | title= New Eighth Doctor costume revealed\n | first= Doctor Who\n | last= News\n | publisher=\n}}\n</ref>\nThe costume consists of a royal blue leather [[pea coat]], a white [[T-shirt]], navy blue [[jeans]] and brown shoes. In this outfit the Doctor also carries a brown [[messenger bag]].\n\n==Spin-off appearances==\n\n===Novels===\nAlmost as soon as he'd left San Francisco, the Doctor had another brief attack of amnesia, caused by a final trap of the Master's. To regain his memories, the Doctor was forced to visit all seven of his past selves and help them out with some crisis or another, at the same time acknowledging the responsibility his role gave him. Having regained his memories, the Doctor met a late twentieth-century [[Coal Hill School]] student named [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Samantha Jones]]; shortly after their encounter, the Doctor left her alone at a [[Greenpeace]] rally.\n\nFor a time, the Doctor adventured with an [[Ice Warrior]] named [[Ssard]] and a human woman named [[Stacy Townsend]], who fell in love with each other; some while after they parted ways with the Doctor, the two invited him to serve as best man at their wedding (''[[Placebo Effect (novel)|Placebo Effect]]''). He also, at some point, teamed up with his old companion [[Bernice Summerfield]], [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] and [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] to combat [[The Dying Days|an Ice Warrior occupation of Great Britain]].\n\n====Faction Paradox====\nEventually, three years after his departure and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great war, looming in the future of Gallifrey, [[Time War (Doctor Who)#Eighth Doctor Adventures|between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy]], with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the issue of the war, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (''[[Alien Bodies]]''). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could make more of a difference with him.\n\nThe close dynamic between the pair was shifted with the introduction of [[Fitz Kreiner]], a sixties bar singer incorrectly suspected of matricide. Fitz took on the role of a sort of younger brother to the Doctor, placing the Time Lord on as high a pedestal as Fitz had ever known. Eventually Fitz found himself abducted by [[Faction Paradox]], a \"time-travelling voodoo cult\", and brainwashed into their legions. When the Doctor realised that a Faction member he had encountered was a biomass copy of Fitz- a 'clone' created and shaped based on others' memories and perceptions of Fitz-, he used the TARDIS's telepathic circuits to restore Fitz's memories and identity to the clone, believing that the original Fitz was dead and reasoning that the clone would essentially be the real Fitz in every way that mattered.\n\nWith both Sam and Fitz gone \u2013 Sam's origins established as a temporal paradox caused by exposure to a scar in reality created when the Doctor regenerated, which the 'original' Sam was only exposed to because the Doctor met blonde Sam \u2013 the Doctor continued his travels with the clone Fitz (although he was treated as the real one and generally thought of himself as such) and [[Compassion (Doctor Who)|Compassion]], an ex-Faction agent implanted with an interface that the Doctor found compatible with his TARDIS. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, the Faction \u2013 with the aid of the original Fitz \u2013 had changed his history, drawing the [[Third Doctor]] to a planet he should never have visited and causing a chain of events that culminated in the Third Doctor regenerating ahead of schedule, allowing them to infect him with the Faction Paradox biodata virus. While his immune system would allow him to resist the virus for a time, it would gain a greater hold on him with each subsequent regeneration, until it would finally transform him into a faction member in his eighth incarnation (''[[Interference: Book One]] and [[Interference: Book Two|Two]]'').\n\nEventually, Compassion's implant, linked to the Doctor's TARDIS to prevent her being influenced by random local signals, triggered her unexpected mutation into a sentient Type 102 TARDIS, specifically the \"mother\" of the TARDISes that would be used in the pending War. With this knowledge, the Time Lords \u2013 led by [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]], now in her third incarnation \u2013 attempted to capture Compassion, intending to use her as breeding stock in preparation for the war. In response, and in light of the apparent destruction of his old TARDIS in a dimensional rift, the Doctor and Fitz retreated into Compassion and fled, the Doctor refusing to let his people enslave his friend in such a manner and resolving to keep on the run until he could find another way to deal with the issue of the War (''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]'').\n\nThe Doctor and Fitz travelled in Compassion for some time, until the machinations of Faction Paradox came to a head back on Gallifrey. As it turned out, in the new timeline triggered by the Doctor's infection, the Doctor was destined to become \"[[Grandfather Paradox (Doctor Who)|Grandfather Paradox]]\", the mythical founder of Faction Paradox. The only factor keeping the original sequence of events in play was the Doctor's TARDIS, which had rebuilt itself after its apparent destruction on Avalon, and had now materialised in a twisted form above Gallifrey, holding within itself the Doctor's original reality where he had regenerated on Metebelis III and never been infected ever since it sensed that something was wrong when the Third Doctor regenerated ahead of schedule.\n\nIn a final confrontation with his future self, the Doctor resolved the timeline conflict by channelling the TARDIS's built-up energies through its weapon systems, thereby destroying both the Faction Paradox fleet and Gallifrey itself. In so doing, the TARDIS was able to rewrite the altered timeline with the original one that it \"remembered\"; no longer able to contain both timelines as a result of its energy drain, one reality had to become 'real'. As a side effect, however, the Doctor's entire memory was erased, apparently from the trauma of the event (''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'').\n\n====Amnesia on Earth====\nTo give the Doctor time to recover and the TARDIS time to regenerate from the extensive damage it had suffered, Compassion dropped the Doctor off on Earth in the year 1889; she then delivered Fitz to 2001, with the intent that he wait for the Doctor to catch up to him. With that, Compassion departed for parts unknown. Back in 1889, meanwhile, the Doctor awoke in a railway carriage to discover no memory as to his real identity, and no possessions save a small, shapeless box\u2013 what was left of the TARDIS after its power loss\u2014 and a note, simply stating \"Meet me in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]', 8 February 2001. Fitz\".\n\nDespite his amnesia, the Doctor retained a wide general knowledge. However, he also showed an uncharacteristic callous streak, easily allowing others to die if he felt that they 'deserved' to perish (''[[The Burning (Doctor Who)|The Burning]]''). To contrast, he was capable of feeling unusually poignant warmth, even dating a woman in the 1980s, and adopting a young girl named [[Miranda (Doctor Who)|Miranda]], a Time Lady from the future (''[[Father Time (Doctor Who)|Father Time]]''). During this time, he often became involved in strange problems outside the norm, such as confronting an entity that was essentially sentient fire (''[[The Burning (novel)|The Burning]]''). He experienced a particular funk in the 1950s, feeling that his efforts to learn about his past were pointless, but his interest in life was re-inspired when he was recruited to defeat his old enemies the Players as they sought to escalate the Cold War (''[[Endgame (Doctor Who)|Endgame]]'').\n\nUnsure what \"St Louis\" was intended by the note, the Doctor created his own in London: the St Louis Bar and Restaurant. As 2001 rolled around, Fitz indeed turned up there to meet him. With the aid of new companion [[Anji Kapoor]], the Doctor and Fitz completed the TARDIS's regeneration, dealt with a race of invading aliens, then set back again to exploring time and space (''[[Escape Velocity (Doctor Who)|Escape Velocity]]'').\n\nWith his freedom restored, the Doctor chose to counteract his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered all manner of unusual beings \u2013 from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (''[[The Year of Intelligent Tigers]]''), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold \u2013 as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (''[[Eater of Wasps]]'') \u2013 he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever had happened to him had happened for a reason, and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered.\n\n====Sabbath and parallel times====\nOnly a few months after resuming his old lifestyle, the Doctor faced another radical change: the loss of his second heart.  As it happened, the heart served as a bond with Gallifrey; with the planet gone, the heart had begun to fester within the Doctor's body, pumping it with poison.\n\nA man named [[Sabbath (Doctor Who)|Sabbath]], an eighteenth-century secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor of some of his higher Time Lord abilities, including his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins. It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers, including allowing Sabbath to travel further from Earth in his own time machine than he had previously been capable of. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm, returning to life after up to a day in a death-like state even after sustaining normally regeneration-inducing injuries such as getting his chest crushed by sandbags (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath).\n\nEventually, after a woman Sabbath loved sacrificed herself to save the Doctor from a malfunctioning time machine, Sabbath tore out the Doctor's second heart, allowing the Doctor to begin growing a new one.\n\nShortly after the restoration of his heart, the Doctor found himself locked in a desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show up, and that the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One \u2013 the [[Big Bang]] \u2013 that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating a plan that would effectively wipe out free will itself, with the Doctor proving that Sabbath's perception was wrong when they found themselves in a situation that could only have occurred due to time travel in a single timeline.\n\nThe explosion at Event One was averted when the Doctor diverted the black light that would have triggered the explosion to 1898, but instead of reality collapsing into a single controllable timeline, what occurred was reality starting to 'slide' between histories, multiple parallel realities fighting to become the dominant one. Along with new companion [[Trix MacMillan|Trix]], the Doctor, Fitz and Anji travelled through the realities, including a world where the computer was never invented, a world where Earth was devastated by a strange even as all life aged forty years in 1843, and a world where humanity had time-travelling tours, with the Doctor being forced to erase at least two of these realities as he sought to restore the original timeline. During this adventure, the Doctor appeared to become a bit more cold and calculating, sacrificing an innocent man to escape a pocket universe and even leaving alternate versions of Fitz and Anji to die to preserve continuity. However, in the end, their sacrifices paid off, the Doctor managing to stabilise reality by resolving a paradox that had been hanging over them since the beginning of the crisis, and then, with Sabbath's help, they confronted his masters; the Council of Eight, mysterious beings who gained power by foreseeing likely future events and then ensuring that they came to pass. The Doctor, as a rogue element existing outside of Time, was the only unpredictable factor in their universe, and was thus the only person who could stop them. Ironically, it was Sabbath himself who gave the Doctor the edge needed to stop the Council; realising that one of the Council members expected Sabbath to shoot the Council member with a weapon designed to send the subject into the Time Vortex, Sabbath instead shot himself, condemning himself to eternal agony in the Time Vortex, but completely undoing the Council's plan and destroying their space station, simultaneously restoring the possibility of parallel worlds to the universe.\n\n====''The Gallifrey Chronicles''====\nSome while after this, the Doctor was captured by Marnal, one of the few surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005 novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.\n\n===Audio dramas===\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|date=June 2017|\n {{Cleanup-tense|section|present|date=April 2014}}\n}}\nPaul McGann first returned to his role as the Eighth Doctor in ''[[Storm Warning (audio drama)|Storm Warning]]'', the first in a series of audio plays, in which the Doctor lands on Earth in October 1930 aboard the doomed [[R101]] airship. Aboard the vessel, the Doctor meets a young adventuress called [[Charley Pollard]] (played by [[India Fisher]]). In the course of his adventure, the Doctor saves Charley's life and takes her aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. This was done in good faith, but the Doctor soon learns that Charley's rescue greatly and negatively effected the timestream.\n\nDespite established in-universe history partly relying upon her death on the R101, the Doctor is unable to return her to preserve the timeline, with Charley's continued existence forming a rough plot arc over two \"seasons\" of audio adventures as the Doctor discovers a series of minor historical anomalies caused by the damage to the timeline, such as the CIA existing in 1933 or [[Benjamin Franklin]] being president. The Doctor eventually learns that, due to Charley's survival, the universe has become infected with \"anti-time,\" leading to a conflict with the wraith-like Never People- individuals who were erased from history for crimes against reality and now seek to unleash the destructive anti-time against the universe- with the resolution of this conflict depicting the Doctor choosing to sacrifice himself and his TARDIS by absorbing anti-time energy, which seals the rift and preserves Charley's life but transforms him into the bogeyman Zagreus. Later restored to sanity but still infected with anti-time through the actions of Charley, his old companions Leela and Romana, and recreations of his immediate three preceding incarnations, the Doctor chooses again to sacrifice himself for the sake of Charley and the universe by removing himself from space and time. He enters a divergent universe for which he has no prior knowledge or frame of reference and in which there is no concept of linear time (''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''). Meanwhile, Charley stows away on his TARDIS, in a sense nullifying the Doctor's sacrifice by again placing herself in danger; for a time, this fact causes great friction between the characters and personal angst for the Doctor.\n\nFor another two seasons, the Doctor, Charley, and a new companion by the name of [[C'rizz]], explore the divergent universe, gradually unravelling a deep plot designed around the Doctor by [[Rassilon]], founder of Time Lord society, who had previously been trapped in anti-time by the Doctor for his role in the creation of Zagreus. Eventually, with the aid of his companions, the Doctor escapes the trap built for him, overcomes his emotional burden, learns that he has been purged of Zagreus, and returns to his normal universe with Charley and C'rizz (''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]'').\n\nFollowing that point, which coincided with the end of the official Big Finish \"seasons\" in light of the return of ''Doctor Who'' to television in 2005, the trio wanders freely. The only continuing plot element involved C'rizz, whose character exhibits unusual and potentially destructive psychological development. This development culminates in C'rizz's death (''[[Absolution (Doctor Who)|Absolution]]''), which inspires in Charley a desire to leave the Doctor's company. Due to amnesia brought on by a healing coma induced by a cyber-planner, the Eighth Doctor believes Charley has left him in 2008 [[Singapore]] (''[[The Girl Who Never Was]]''), when she is in fact displaced into the year 500,002, whence she is rescued by the [[Sixth Doctor]] (''[[The Condemned (Doctor Who audio)|The Condemned]]''). Believing that the Eighth Doctor died before their parting, Charley thus spends some time travelling with the Sixth Doctor, but their time together ends when an alien race called the Viyrans replace his memories of Charley with another woman, Mila, to preserve the timeline.\n\nStarting New Year's Eve 2006, a new audio series titled ''[[The Eighth Doctor Adventures (audio drama series)|The Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' featuring the Doctor and new companion [[Lucie Miller]] (played by [[Sheridan Smith]]) was broadcast on BBC7. A second series followed in 2007. A third season was streamed from the Big Finish website, and was available on CD. A fourth and final season started in 2009 with the Christmas episode ''[[Death in Blackpool]]'' which dealt with Lucie's departure. Also in December 2009, the standalone episode ''[[An Earthly Child]]'' was released, in which the Doctor visits his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] on Earth (following up on the events of the [[First Doctor]] adventure ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'') and meets his great-grandson Alex Campbell. In ''[[Situation Vacant]]'' the Doctor gains a new companion, [[Tamsin Drew]] \u2013 drawn from four prospective companions. This season puts the Eighth Doctor up against a new incarnation of [[The Monk (Doctor Who)|the Meddling Monk]], now travelling with Lucie Miller, but in the course of the season Tamsin is seduced to the Meddling Monk's way of thinking while Lucie finds the Monk's violence distasteful and re-joins the Doctor. When the Monk helps the Daleks launch an invasion of Earth, Tamsin, Lucie, and Alex are killed driving them off, although at the last minute the Monk betrays the Daleks to help save the Doctor and Susan.\n\nIn November 2012 Big Finish released a boxed set of four audio dramas called ''[[Dark Eyes (audio drama)|Dark Eyes]]'', whose stories take place after ''[[To the Death (audio drama)|To the Death]]''. The set also introduced a new companion, [[Molly O'Sullivan]] (played by [[Ruth Bradley]]), an Irish [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] nursing assistant in [[World War I]]. Here the Eighth Doctor changes his appearance, cutting his hair and changing into a WWI navy trench coat after his Victorian clothing is ruined.\n\nAn [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]] version of the Eighth Doctor, from a timeline where the Seventh Doctor regenerates after being shot by the Nazis in the 1950s, was first mentioned in the audio drama ''[[Colditz (audio drama)|Colditz]]'', and appears (played by McGann) in ''[[Survival of the Fittest & Klein\u2019s Story#Klein\u2019s Story|Klein's Story]]''. Under the alias \"Schmidt,\" the Doctor teaches [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Klein|Klein]] how to pilot the TARDIS, thereby putting her in a position to inadvertently assist the Seventh Doctor in preventing this timeline from occurring (unable to go back himself as the TARDIS security protocols would prevent him from going somewhere where he was already).\n\nIn a trilogy of adventures, released in October through December 2011 as part of Big Finish's continuing monthly range, The Doctor travels with [[Mary Shelley (Doctor Who)|Mary Shelley]] (as played by [[Julie Cox]]), first acknowledged as a friend of the Eighth Doctor's in ''[[The Company of Friends]]''. The first story, ''[[The Silver Turk]]'', features the early breed of the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as seen in ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[The Witch from the Well]]'' tests the pair's relationship, and the trilogy concludes with ''[[Army of Death]]''.\n\nIn 2013, Big Finish released a special 50th Anniversary story, ''The Light at the End'', in which the Master ([[Geoffrey Beevers]]) implements a plot to trap and destroy all eight incarnations of the Doctor by keeping him on Gallifrey. The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor ([[Tom Baker]]) and Leela ([[Louise Jameson]]), the Fifth Doctor ([[Peter Davison]]) and Nyssa ([[Sarah Sutton]]), the Sixth Doctor ([[Colin Baker]]) and Peri, and the Seventh Doctor ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) and Ace ([[Sophie Aldred]]). Working together with the First Doctor ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), Second Doctor ([[Frazer Hines]]), and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), they manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions [[Susan Foreman|Susan]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]), [[Steven Taylor (Doctor Who)|Steven Taylor]] ([[Peter Purves]]), [[Sara Kingdom]] ([[Jean Marsh]]), [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] ([[Anneke Wills]]), [[Jamie McCrimmon]] ([[Frazer Hines]]), [[Zoe Heriot]] ([[Wendy Padbury]]), [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]), [[Tegan Jovanka]] ([[Janet Fielding]]), and [[Vislor Turlough|Turlough]] ([[Mark Strickson]]) also made appearances in the audio drama.\n\nIn the 2013 live action mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\", the Eighth Doctor saluted Charley, C'rizz, Lucie, Tamsin and Molly from the Big Finish range prior to his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first ''Dark Eyes'' boxed set, Big Finish released three more sets, continuing Molly's story and introducing [[Liv Chenka]] as a new companion (Chenka having previously met the Seventh Doctor in the audio ''Robophobia''). The Eighth Doctor goes on to appear in a four-CD, four-part miniseries, ''Doom Coalition'', which sees him, Liv, and new companion Helen Sinclair on the hunt for the insane Time Lord known as the Eleven, who suffers from a unique mental defect where all of his past personalities are active in his mind at once. In the course of the series, the Doctor peripherally interacts with the [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s future wife [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] (although she takes care to avoid directly interacting with the Eighth Doctor unless disguised) and at one point confronts an alliance between the Monk and the [[Weeping Angels]]. ''Doom Coalition'' concludes with the Doctor thwarting the plans of the titular Coalition, who are revealed to be a group of Time Lords led by the Doctor's old schoolfriend Padrac, with Padrac's latest consultations with the Matrix having driven him to the conclusion that the only way to save Gallifrey from 'prophecies' of its own destruction is to destroy the rest of the universe.\n\nBeginning in 2017, Big Finish began releasing two separate Eighth Doctor series of box sets in the form of ''Ravenous'' and ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War''. ''Ravenous'' is a series of four four-part box sets that serve as a direct sequel to ''Doom Coalition'', initially depicting the Doctor and Liv's efforts to find Helen after she is trapped with the Eleven, but subsequently progresses to depict their efforts to oppose the Ravenous, an ancient race who are essentially the natural predator of the Time Lords as they evolved to feed on the energy released when Time Lords regenerate (the Ravenous are described as being the reason humans fear clowns, as they essentially resemble clowns in their natural state). The series concludes with the Doctor indirectly working with three different incarnations of the Master- including the Master of the TV movie, the War Master and Missy, the latter two of whom do not meet the Doctor face-to-face- to essentially restore the Ravenous to their original state, having determined that they drain energy from Time Lords after an ancient Gallifreyan scientist accidentally stole much of their natural energy millennia ago. ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War'' is another series of four four-part box sets, set later in the Eighth Doctor's life during the early days of the Time War, depicting his efforts to protect those caught in the crossfire with the aid of his new companion Bliss, whose planet's history was undone when a Time Lord agent turned her planet into a weapons depot while her own history is in chaos due to the side-effects of the Time War. The third volume of ''Time War'' also sees the Doctor forced to face the [[Valeyard]] once again when his other self is recreated due to the Doctor being exposed to biology-manipulating technology while using a transmat, the two technologies somehow manifesting a new version of the Valeyard from the transmat after the Doctor departs.\n\n===Comic strips===\n\n====Unfinished business====\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strips, at an unstated time after his regeneration (and after an adventure in the 1930s involving [[Fey Truscott-Sade]] and psychic weasels), the Doctor revisited the town of Stockbridge. After being caught up in the games of the [[Celestial Toymaker]], he picked up a new companion in lively sci-fi fan [[Izzy Sinclair]]. The two of them were soon caught up in the machinations of the Doctor's old enemies the Threshold, a mercenary organisation. The Threshold attempted to manipulate the Doctor into stopping the Daleks gaining access to the multiverse (which would kill an artificial solar system as a side effect) and dying in the attempt, but were outmaneuvered. Unknown to him, they implanted a device in Fey Truscott-Sade so that they could use her as an unwilling spy when she next encountered the Doctor. She did so in 1939, assisting him and Izzy against the vampiric Varney; the Doctor was left infected with a deadly bacillus, and he had to be taken to Gallifrey to be cured, luring him into a battle against a Time Lord cult called the Final Chapter.\n\nWorking out that the Threshold were using Fey as a spy, the Doctor and his old comrade [[Shayde]] faked a regeneration. The Threshold was conned into believing they were facing a vulnerable new Doctor (Shayde in disguise), allowing the real Doctor to infiltrate their base. While he and his friends were too late to stop the Threshold from destroying every single spacecraft in the universe, they were able to bring about the organisation's destruction before it could profit. Fey returned to her time, having also bonded with Shayde to save his life.\n\nUnknowingly, the TARDIS had been taken over by the Master, who was manipulating events to gain the power of the omniversal Glory. The Doctor was specifically sent to times and places that would undermine him \u2013 discovering he had upset the course of Grace Holloway's life in 2001, encountering an alien race with motivations uncomfortably similar to his which caused death and horror in 17th Century Japan, and almost killing the benevolent [[Kroton (Cyberman)|Kroton]] by mistake. (A slight diversion between events saw the Doctor and Izzy team up with the actor [[Tom Baker]] and other 1970s television actors against [[Beep the Meep]] in 1979.)\n\nIn 17th Century Japan, the Doctor's attempt to save the life of samurai Katsura Sato, a friend of Izzy, left the man inadvertently immortal and thus robbed of both an honourable death and any sense of empathy. The Master later came for Sato, when he was mentally vulnerable, and gave him a fake religion to focus his mind on; Earth's history was altered as Sato, renamed Lord Morningstar, and his Church of the Glorious Dead conquered the planet, creating a technological advanced, highly brutal planet of jihadists. The Doctor, Izzy and Kroton wandered into their invasion of the museum planet Paradost; while the Doctor faced the Master over the Glory, Izzy and Kroton spent weeks on the occupied world. The Doctor was defeated, only for the Master discover he was not able to access the Glory, as instead Kroton and Sato had been the ones prophesied to battle for it. Kroton won the Glory, the Master was purged from the TARDIS and history was reverted, and the Doctor and Izzy took a well-earned break.\n\n====Destrii====\n\nDuring a battle against the body-stealing Ophidians and their gigantic snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called [[Destrii]]. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in coming to terms with the change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. [[Frida Kahlo]] helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the humanised Daleks he had created in his [[Evil of the Daleks|second incarnation]]. Unable to prevent their tragic end \u2013 self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, the two of them were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy-beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii.\n\nThe Doctor went on a relentless search to rescue his friend, with the help of Fey/Shayde and by forcing co-operation from Destrii, still alive in her stolen body. His quest led him to the planet Oblivion, a surreal and brutal world ruled by Destrii's mother, the Matriax. Izzy was rescued and returned to her original form, while Oblivion's court system and the menace of the Horde were both destroyed, leaving Destrii free to leave her world and explore the universe with her roguish uncle Jodafra. However, Izzy had decided she wanted to return home to her family, and the Doctor was left alone.\n\nFeeling slightly morose, the Doctor was cheered up by an unknowing encounter with his old companion [[Frobisher (Doctor Who)|Frobisher]] and went on several 'holiday' adventures on his own. He eventually re-encountered Destrii and Jodafra in America during the 19th Century, where the upcoming clash between [[General Custer]] and [[Chief Sitting Bull]] was interrupted by Jodafra's machinations involving the monstrous [[wendigo]]. Jodafra had made a deal with the creature: power in exchange for being fed children. Unable to stomach this and with the Doctor urging her to listen to the spark of decency in her, Destrii helped the Doctor stop her uncle. In revenge, she was left beaten and abandoned, and the Doctor took her in as a probationary companion. Together, the two of them teamed up with [[MI6]] and faced an invasion of early 21st Century Earth by time-travelling [[Cybermen]]; they were preparing to chemically overload the emotions of humans and thus make them willingly surrender to have their emotions removed by conversion. The Doctor destroyed them through use of the Time Vortex (similar to the later \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\"), almost surrendering to it but giving up its power to save Destrii.\n\nIn 2007, [[Panini Books]] published ''Doctor Who: The Flood'', the final collection of comic strips featuring the Eighth Doctor in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. The book includes the essay \"Flood Barriers\" by strip editor Clayton Hickman in which he reveals that [[Russell T Davies]] had authorised the comic strip to depict the regeneration of the Eighth Doctor into the [[Ninth Doctor]] at the end of the 2004\u20132005 arc, ''The Flood''. The cause of the regeneration would have been the Doctor's exposure to the Time Vortex in his efforts to destroy the Cybermen (the same cause that triggered the later Ninth to [[Tenth Doctor]] regeneration in ''Parting of the Ways''). Destrii would have witnessed the regeneration and would have continued to travel with the Ninth Doctor in a proposed ''Year One'' arc. However [[BBC Wales]] vetoed the ''Year One'' arc and indicated the Ninth Doctor could only be shown travelling with [[Rose Tyler]], Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually decided not to depict the regeneration as they would have been unable to give Destrii a proper departure. The Panini collection includes the original script for the regeneration sequence, as well as never before published art showing the regeneration itself.<ref>{{Cite book\n\n|last=\n|first=\n|author2=\n|year=2007\n|title=Doctor Who: The Flood \u2013 The Complete Eighth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 4\n|location=London\n|publisher=[[Panini Books]]\n|isbn=978-1-905239-65-8\n|pages=216\u2013223\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor''===\nIn the ''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor'' comic series, the Eighth Doctor \u2013 from a point shortly before the Time War, as he is shown in the clothing and hairstyle he wore in \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" \u2013 is visiting an old holiday house of his where he encounters a young painter named Josie Day.
