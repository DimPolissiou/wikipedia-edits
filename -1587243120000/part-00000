The design of the Gopher protocol and user interface is menu-driven, and presented an alternative to the [[World Wide Web]] in [[History of the World Wide Web|its early stages]], but ultimately fell into disfavor, yielding to the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP). The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Scott|date=September 5, 2016|title=How Gopher Nearly Won the Internet.|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Gopher-Nearly-Won-the/237682?cid=wc&elqTrackId=efb09ffa986845e1ac578b879a71c12d&elq=79b4d513152c4e8c8f1c4e70634b60c9&elqaid=10545&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=3974|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date= 12 September 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe protocol was invented by a team led by [[Mark P.

By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding.

Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\n===Server census===\n*{{As of|2012}}, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica-2]],<ref name=\"Veronica report\">{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/0/v2/vstat |title=Floodgap Gopher-HTTP gateway gopher://gopher/0/v2/vstat |website=Gopher.floodgap.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/8909 |title=Down the Gopher Hole |last=Kaiser |first=Cameron |publisher=TidBITS |date=19 March 2007 |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> They are typically infrequently updated.

At a minimum, whatever a person can do with data files on a [[CD-ROM]], one can do on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| image1 = Floodgap gopher top menu.PNG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The top level menu of a Gopher server. Selecting the \"Fun and Games\" menu item...\n| image2 = Floodgap gopher fun menu.PNG\n| width2 = {{#expr: (183 * 1249 / 755) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ...takes the user to the \"Fun and Games\" menu.\n| footer = \n}}\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\n===Protocol===\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has assigned [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[List of well-known ports (computing)|port]] 70 to the Gopher protocol.\n\nThe protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client. A standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows:\n\n<pre>\n/Reference\n1CIA World Factbook     /Archives/mirrors/textfiles.com/politics/CIA    gopher.quux.org 70\n0Jargon 4.2.0   /Reference/Jargon 4.2.0 gopher.quux.org 70      +\n1Online Libraries       /Reference/Online Libraries     gopher.quux.org 70     +\n1RFCs: Internet Standards       /Computers/Standards and Specs/RFC      gopher.quux.org 70\n1U.S. Gazetteer /Reference/U.S. Gazetteer       gopher.quux.org 70      +\niThis file contains information on United States        fake    (NULL)  0\nicities, counties, and geographical areas.  It has      fake    (NULL)  0\nilatitude/longitude, population, land and water area,   fake    (NULL)  0\niand ZIP codes. fake    (NULL)  0\ni       fake    (NULL)  0\niTo search for a city, enter the city's name.  To search        fake    (NULL) 0\nifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance,        fake    (NULL) 0\niDallas County. fake    (NULL)  0\n</pre>\n\nHere, the client has established a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a [[Newline|line feed]] (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, as is the case here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.\n\nIn this example, the item sent back is a gopher menu, a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as [[hypertext]] links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.<ref name=\"wwwunleashed\" />\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\", and consist of five fields: the ''item type'' as the very first character (see below), the ''display string'' (i.e., the description text to display), a ''selector'' (i.e., a file-system pathname), ''host name'' (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and ''port'' (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as [[netcat]] make it possible to download Gopher content easily from the command line:\n echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 > jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by [[cURL]] as of 7.21.2-DEV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curl: Re: Gopher patches for cURL (includes test suite)|url=https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0346.html|access-date=9 March 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421225505/https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0346.html|archivedate=21 April 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Source code of a menu===\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of [[tab-separated values]] in a [[text file]]. This file is sometimes called a ''gophermap''. As the [[source code]] to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an [[HTML]] file for a [[web page]]. Each tab-separated line (called a ''selector line'') gives the [[client software]] a description of the menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the ''item type'', which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the [[media type]] system used by the Web and [[email attachment]]s.\n\nThe item type is followed by the ''user display string'' (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a [[Path (computing)|path]] or other string for the resource on the server); the ''hostname'' (the [[domain name]] or [[IP address]] of the server), and the [[network port]].\n\nFor example: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the [[subdomain]] gopher.floodgap.com, on [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 70. The item type of {{var|1}} indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the user  sees in the menu.\n\n 1Floodgap Home\t/home\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Item type !! User display string !! Selector !! Hostname !! [[Port (computer networking)|Port]] \n|-\n| 1 || Floodgap Home || /home || gopher.floodgap.com || 70\n|}\n\nIn addition to selector lines, a gophermap may contain ''comment lines''. Comment lines are not for [[code comments]]; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no [[tab character]]s.\n\n====Item types====\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are [[case-sensitive]].\n\nThe [[technical specification]] for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type {{code|3}} is an [[error code]] for [[exception handling]]. Gopher client authors improvised item types {{code|h}} (HTML), {{code|i}} (informational message), and {{code|s}} ([[sound file]]) after the publication of RFC 1436.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" {{partial|Canonical types}}\n|-\n| {{okay|'''0'''}} || [[Text file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''1'''}} || Gopher submenu\n|-\n| {{okay|'''2'''}} || [[CCSO Nameserver]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''3'''}} || Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure\n|-\n| {{okay|'''4'''}} || [[BinHex]]-encoded file (primarily for [[Macintosh]] computers)\n|-\n| {{okay|'''5'''}} || [[DOS]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''6'''}} || [[uuencoded]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''7'''}} || Gopher [[full-text search]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''8'''}} || [[Telnet]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''9'''}} || [[Binary file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''+'''}} || Mirror or alternate server (for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] or in case of primary server [[downtime]])\n|-\n| {{okay|'''g'''}} || [[GIF]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''I'''}} || [[Image file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''T'''}} || [[Telnet 3270]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" {{unofficial|Non-canonical types}} \n|-\n|style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''d''' ||  Doc.

[[John Goerzen]] created an addition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.quux.org/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02 |title=Gopher: gopher.2002-02 |publisher=Gopher.quux.org |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref> to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is {{code|h}}, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"<nowiki>URL:http://gopher.quux.org/</nowiki>\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\n===Related technology===\nThe master Gopherspace search engine is [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]. Veronica offers a keyword search of all the public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search produces a menu of Gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jugtail]].\n\n[[GopherVR]] is a 3D virtual reality variant of the original Gopher system.\n\n==Client software==\n===Web browsers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher's stagnation:\n\n* In February 1993, the [[University of Minnesota]] announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funet.fi/pub/vms/networking/gopher/gopher-software-licensing-policy.ancient |title=Subject: University of Minnesota Gopher software licensing policy |publisher=Funet.fi |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref><ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\" /> Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations.<ref>{{cite web|author=JQ Johnson |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1mj6cb$6gm@pith.uoregon.edu |title=Message from discussion gopher licensing |date=25 February 1993 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Rubin |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=36e4c2f1.10244576@nntp.best.ix.netcom.com |title=CW from the VOA server page \u2013 rec.radio.shortwave |date=3 March 1999 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>  Gopher expansion stagnated, to the advantage of the World Wide Web, to which [[CERN]] disclaimed ownership.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Software Movement|author=Johan S\u00f6derberg|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=25|isbn=978-0-415-95543-0}}</ref> In September 2000, the University of Minnesota re-licensed its Gopher software under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.infosystems.gopher/4A-LS_A6qtA/nT89yWKzzsIJ |title=Google Groups |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref>\n* Gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, which subsumed its protocol.\n* Gopher has a more rigid structure than the free-form [[HTML]] of the Web. Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\n===Server census===\n*{{As of|2012}}, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica-2]],<ref name=\"Veronica report\">{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/0/v2/vstat |title=Floodgap Gopher-HTTP gateway gopher://gopher/0/v2/vstat |website=Gopher.floodgap.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/8909 |title=Down the Gopher Hole |last=Kaiser |first=Cameron |publisher=TidBITS |date=19 March 2007 |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> They are typically infrequently updated.

At a minimum, whatever a person can do with data files on a [[CD-ROM]], one can do on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| image1 = Floodgap gopher top menu.PNG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The top level menu of a Gopher server. Selecting the \"Fun and Games\" menu item...\n| image2 = Floodgap gopher fun menu.PNG\n| width2 = {{#expr: (183 * 1249 / 755) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ...takes the user to the \"Fun and Games\" menu.\n| footer = \n}}\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\n===Protocol===\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has assigned [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[List of well-known ports (computing)|port]] 70 to the Gopher protocol.\n\nThe protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client. A standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows:\n\n<pre>\n/Reference\n1CIA World Factbook     /Archives/mirrors/textfiles.com/politics/CIA    gopher.quux.org 70\n0Jargon 4.2.0   /Reference/Jargon 4.2.0 gopher.quux.org 70      +\n1Online Libraries       /Reference/Online Libraries     gopher.quux.org 70     +\n1RFCs: Internet Standards       /Computers/Standards and Specs/RFC      gopher.quux.org 70\n1U.S. Gazetteer /Reference/U.S. Gazetteer       gopher.quux.org 70      +\niThis file contains information on United States        fake    (NULL)  0\nicities, counties, and geographical areas.  It has      fake    (NULL)  0\nilatitude/longitude, population, land and water area,   fake    (NULL)  0\niand ZIP codes. fake    (NULL)  0\ni       fake    (NULL)  0\niTo search for a city, enter the city's name.  To search        fake    (NULL) 0\nifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance,        fake    (NULL) 0\niDallas County. fake    (NULL)  0\n</pre>\n\nHere, the client has established a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a [[Newline|line feed]] (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, as is the case here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.\n\nIn this example, the item sent back is a gopher menu, a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as [[hypertext]] links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.<ref name=\"wwwunleashed\" />\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\", and consist of five fields: the ''item type'' as the very first character (see below), the ''display string'' (i.e., the description text to display), a ''selector'' (i.e., a file-system pathname), ''host name'' (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and ''port'' (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as [[netcat]] make it possible to download Gopher content easily from the command line:\n echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 > jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by [[cURL]] as of 7.21.2-DEV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curl: Re: Gopher patches for cURL (includes test suite)|url=https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0346.html|access-date=9 March 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421225505/https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0346.html|archivedate=21 April 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Source code of a menu===\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of [[tab-separated values]] in a [[text file]]. This file is sometimes called a ''gophermap''. As the [[source code]] to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an [[HTML]] file for a [[web page]]. Each tab-separated line (called a ''selector line'') gives the [[client software]] a description of the menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the ''item type'', which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the [[media type]] system used by the Web and [[email attachment]]s.\n\nThe item type is followed by the ''user display string'' (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a [[Path (computing)|path]] or other string for the resource on the server); the ''hostname'' (the [[domain name]] or [[IP address]] of the server), and the [[network port]].\n\nFor example: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the [[subdomain]] gopher.floodgap.com, on [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 70. The item type of {{var|1}} indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the user  sees in the menu.\n\n 1Floodgap Home\t/home\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Item type !! User display string !! Selector !! Hostname !! [[Port (computer networking)|Port]] \n|-\n| 1 || Floodgap Home || /home || gopher.floodgap.com || 70\n|}\n\nIn addition to selector lines, a gophermap may contain ''comment lines''. Comment lines are not for [[code comments]]; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no [[tab character]]s.\n\n====Item types====\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are [[case-sensitive]].\n\nThe [[technical specification]] for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type {{code|3}} is an [[error code]] for [[exception handling]]. Gopher client authors improvised item types {{code|h}} (HTML), {{code|i}} (informational message), and {{code|s}} ([[sound file]]) after the publication of RFC 1436.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" {{partial|Canonical types}}\n|-\n| {{okay|'''0'''}} || [[Text file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''1'''}} || Gopher submenu\n|-\n| {{okay|'''2'''}} || [[CCSO Nameserver]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''3'''}} || Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure\n|-\n| {{okay|'''4'''}} || [[BinHex]]-encoded file (primarily for [[Macintosh]] computers)\n|-\n| {{okay|'''5'''}} || [[DOS]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''6'''}} || [[uuencoded]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''7'''}} || Gopher [[full-text search]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''8'''}} || [[Telnet]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''9'''}} || [[Binary file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''+'''}} || Mirror or alternate server (for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] or in case of primary server [[downtime]])\n|-\n| {{okay|'''g'''}} || [[GIF]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''I'''}} || [[Image file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''T'''}} || [[Telnet 3270]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" {{unofficial|Non-canonical types}} \n|-\n|style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''d''' ||  Doc.

[[John Goerzen]] created an addition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.quux.org/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02 |title=Gopher: gopher.2002-02 |publisher=Gopher.quux.org |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref> to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is {{code|h}}, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"<nowiki>URL:http://gopher.quux.org/</nowiki>\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\n===Related technology===\nThe master Gopherspace search engine is [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]. Veronica offers a keyword search of all the public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search produces a menu of Gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jugtail]].\n\n[[GopherVR]] is a 3D virtual reality variant of the original Gopher system.\n\n==Client software==\n===Web browsers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

Similarly, certain server packages such as GN and [[PyGopherd]] have built-in Gopher to [[HTTP]] interfaces. [[Squid (software)|Squid Proxy]] software gateways any gopher:// URL to HTTP content, enabling any browser or web agent to access gopher content easily.\n\n==Server software==\nBecause the protocol is trivial to implement in a basic fashion, there are many server packages still available, and some are still maintained.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

The institution was designed by [[Richard Harte Keatinge|Colonel Keatinge]] and was formally opened by the Governor of Bombay, [[William Vesey-FitzGerald|H. B. Sir Seymour Fitzgerald]], in 1870. The college was founded for the education of the princely order by the princes and chiefs of [[Kathiawad]] for their sons and relations.<ref name=\"Bhalla2015\">{{cite book|author=A. S.

The college is a founding member of the Indian Public Schools Conference and a member of the [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square]] conference of schools, a worldwide association of more than 60 schools that allows students to travel between schools and tour the country or do community service.\n\nIn 2001 the college opened its doors to girls, in what has been a boys' bastion for over a century. The school has around 50 girls, with boarding facilities.\n\nAnother endeavor of the Rajkumar College Administration has been Priyalok Villas, a pre-school program for the kids; originally housed in a 1909 Hyde sanatorium but now housed in a different building. Whilst having its own domain, it has access to all the facilities of the Rajkumar College.\n\nThe school is expanding. The Rajkumar College for Girls, a secondary school was inaugurated on 24 March 2011; before this, the fully functional elementary co-ed school had flourished for a decade.\n\n===Inauguration of the Rajkumar College for Girls, Rajkot===\nThe Rajkumar College for Girls was inaugurated on 24 March 2011, by [[Kamla Beniwal]], governor of Gujarat. The principal, Mr. Thakckar, said that it was a special day for the Rajkumar family. Almost 140 years ago on 16 December 1870 the college was inaugurated by the governor of the Bombay Presidency, Sir Seymour Fitzgerald.\n\n==Student life==\nSport teams from the college travel around the country to participate in inter public school competitions and district/state/national level events.\n\nCo-curricular activities include public speaking/recitation/debates, bio-enrichment camps, and other cultural activities.\n\nThe college motto is ''Yasya Bhuddhi, Balam Tasya'' (\"Power is where there is knowledge\").\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* Lael Anson Best, graduated BS in 1975, Chief of [[Thoracic Surgery]] and Chief of Surgery 2005-2012 at [[Rambam Hospital|Rambam Medical Center]], Israel Awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Smman Award 2017 \n*[[Shahu of Kolhapur|Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur]]: Primary education to all; a true democrat and social reformer \n*[[Yashwantrao Martandrao Mukne]], Maharaja of [[Jawhar State]], the first [[Member of parliament]] from [[Thane (Lok Sabha constituency)]]\n* [[Krishna Kumarasingh Bhavasingh]], Maharaja of [[Bhavnagar State]], the first governor of Madras state\n* [[Nawab]] [[Muhammad Mahabat Khan III]] [[Nawab]] of [[Junagadh State]]\n* [[Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji]] [[Babi (title)|Babi]] of [[Manavadar State]]\n* [[Namdar]]{{dn|date=March 2019}} [[Darbar (title)|Darbar]] saheb and Nanipati Ayaaz [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Babi (title)|Babi]] of [[Pajod]]\n* [[Sahibzada]] Omeir Ahmed Khanji [[Babi (title)|Babi]] of Devgam [[Junagadh State]]\n* [[Raol Shri Dharmakumarsinhji]], prince, ornithologist and environmentalist\n* [[Madansinhji]] - Maharaja of [[Kutch district|Kutch]]\n* [[Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji of Porbandar]], Maharaja of [[Porbandar]]\n* [[K.S.

The institution was designed by [[Richard Harte Keatinge|Colonel Keatinge]] and was formally opened by the Governor of Bombay, [[William Vesey-FitzGerald|H. B. Sir Seymour Fitzgerald]], in 1870. The college was founded for the education of the princely order by the princes and chiefs of [[Kathiawad]] for their sons and relations.<ref name=\"Bhalla2015\">{{cite book|author=A. S.

The college is a founding member of the Indian Public Schools Conference and a member of the [[Round Square]] conference of schools, a worldwide association of more than 60 schools that allows students to travel between schools and tour the country or do community service.\n\nIn 2001 the college opened its doors to girls, in what has been a boys' bastion for over a century. The school has around 50 girls, with boarding facilities.\n\nAnother endeavor of the Rajkumar College Administration has been Priyalok Villas, a pre-school program for the kids; originally housed in a 1909 Hyde sanatorium but now housed in a different building. Whilst having its own domain, it has access to all the facilities of the Rajkumar College.\n\nThe school is expanding. The Rajkumar College for Girls, a secondary school was inaugurated on 24 March 2011; before this, the fully functional elementary co-ed school had flourished for a decade.\n\n===Inauguration of the Rajkumar College for Girls, Rajkot===\nThe Rajkumar College for Girls was inaugurated on 24 March 2011, by [[Kamla Beniwal]], governor of Gujarat. The principal, Mr. Thakckar, said that it was a special day for the Rajkumar family. Almost 140 years ago on 16 December 1870 the college was inaugurated by the governor of the Bombay Presidency, Sir Seymour Fitzgerald.\n\n==Student life==\nSport teams from the college travel around the country to participate in inter public school competitions and district/state/national level events.\n\nCo-curricular activities include public speaking/recitation/debates, bio-enrichment camps, and other cultural activities.\n\nThe college motto is ''Yasya Bhuddhi, Balam Tasya'' (\"Power is where there is knowledge\").\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* Lael Anson Best, graduated BS in 1975, Chief of [[Thoracic Surgery]] and Chief of Surgery 2005-2012 at [[Rambam Hospital|Rambam Medical Center]], Israel Awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Smman Award 2017 \n*[[Shahu of Kolhapur|Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur]]: Primary education to all; a true democrat and social reformer \n*[[Yashwantrao Martandrao Mukne]], Maharaja of [[Jawhar State]], the first [[Member of parliament]] from [[Thane (Lok Sabha constituency)]]\n* [[Krishna Kumarasingh Bhavasingh]], Maharaja of [[Bhavnagar State]], the first governor of Madras state\n* [[Nawab]] [[Muhammad Mahabat Khan III]] [[Nawab]] of [[Junagadh State]]\n* [[Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji]] [[Babi (title)|Babi]] of [[Manavadar State]]\n* [[Namdar]]{{dn|date=March 2019}} [[Darbar (title)|Darbar]] saheb and Nanipati Ayaaz [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Babi (title)|Babi]] of [[Pajod]]\n* [[Sahibzada]] Omeir Ahmed Khanji [[Babi (title)|Babi]] of Devgam [[Junagadh State]]\n* [[Raol Shri Dharmakumarsinhji]], prince, ornithologist and environmentalist\n* [[Madansinhji]] - Maharaja of [[Kutch district|Kutch]]\n* [[Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji of Porbandar]], Maharaja of [[Porbandar]]\n* [[K.S.

He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]]. After making over 100 appearances for City, and winning the [[Conference League Cup]] in 2001, he was allowed to leave in early 2003. After 18 months with [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]], he played for a host of [[Non-League football|non-league]] clubs including [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]], and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].\n\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but soon got the chance to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club [[Ljungskile SK|Ljungskile]] in the summer of 2009, and despite winning the DM Cup, his tenure was short with the [[Superettan]] side.\n\nIn 2010, Lancaster moved back to the United States, signing for [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Miami FC]] who later change their name to the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 2011. He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with [[National Premier Soccer League]] club [[Georgia Revolution FC|Georgia Revolution]] in 2014, he retired from competitive football.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLancaster was born in [[Higher End|Billinge]], Greater Manchester. He lived in [[Haydock]] and attended [[Haydock High School]].<ref name=\"haydock\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/martyn.lancaster.9/about?section=education |url-status=dead

He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]].

After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season.

He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with [[National Premier Soccer League]] club [[Georgia Revolution FC|Georgia Revolution]] in 2014, he retired from competitive football.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLancaster was born in [[Higher End|Billinge]], Greater Manchester.

In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King]] as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. The bishops at the [[Convocation of Canterbury]] in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of praemunire and only after these words were added: \"as far as Christ law allows\".

Retrieved 1 December 2015.</ref>\n\n=== ''Utopia'' ===\n{{Main|Utopia (book)}}\n\nMore's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical \"[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]\" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].\n\nUtopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.\n\n''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.\n\n=== Religious polemics ===\nIn 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225\u20136}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' (\"Defender of the Faith\") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|226\u20137}}\n\nMartin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a \"pig, dolt, and liar\".<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered \"a much steadier personality\",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an \"ape\", a \"drunkard\", and a \"lousy little friar\" amongst other epithets.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:\n\n:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=Alan Dundes |author2=Carl R.

He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|279\u201381}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.\n\nIn 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}}\n\n=== Correspondence ===\nMost major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called \"prison-letters\" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name=\"Gerard\" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.<ref name=\"MoynahanBrian\" />\n\nMore also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.\n\n== Canonization ==\n[[File:MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg|thumb|Medal of Saint Thomas More]]\n\n==={{anchor|Catholic Church}} Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]], and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886.

Page 1</ref>\n\nThe 20th-century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed Thomas More as the [[tragic hero]] of his 1960 play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''. The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:\n\n<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name=oconnell /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1966, the play ''A Man for All Seasons'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was \"the most difficult part I played.\"<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of \"the common man\" that had been cut from the 1966 film.\n\nCatholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world \"Astrobe\", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: \"He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.\"\n\n[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' (\"Die you fool!\"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.\n\nThe novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nLiterary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as \"cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics\".<ref name=\"Wood2010\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, \"More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.\n\nOther biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].\n\nThe protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is \"Dr Thomas More\", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.\n\nMore is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song \"A Man For All Seasons\" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song \"Sir\", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song \"[[So Says I]]\" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.\n\n[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].<ref name=FishOnline1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/asupplicacyonfo01fishgoog|quote=simon fish.|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=Early English Text Society|last1=Fish|first1=Simon|year=1871}}</ref><ref name=MoreVsFish1>see Fish, Simon. \"Supplycacion for the Beggar.\" 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B.

The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.\n\nIn 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). \"The Tudors on Film and Television\", p. 92.

[[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall]], which was part of More's London residence, was eventually relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect [[Walter Godfrey]] in 1910. Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.\n\n=== Chelsea Old Church ===\n[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]\nAcross a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as \"saint\", \"scholar\", and \"statesman\"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.\n\n=== Tower Hill ===\nA plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.\n\n=== St Katharine Docks ===\nThomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of \"Knighten Guild\", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===\n[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbr\u00fcggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for the deaf.\n\n== Works ==\nNote: The reference \"CW\" is to the relevant volume of the ''[[Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More]]'' (New Haven and London 1963\u20131997)\n\n=== Published during More's life (with dates of publication) ===\n* ''A Merry Jest'' (c. 1516) (CW 1)\n* ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) (CW 4)\n* ''Latin Poems'' (1518, 1520) (CW 3, Pt.2)\n* ''Letter to Brixius'' (1520) (CW 3, Pt. 2, App C)\n* ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' (The Answer to Luther, 1523) (CW 5)\n* ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'' (1529, 1530) (CW 6)\n* ''Supplication of Souls'' (1529) (CW 7)\n* ''Letter Against Frith'' (1532) (CW 7) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/1557Workes/Letter_Frith.pdf pdf]\n* ''The Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'' (1532, 1533) (CW 8) Books 1\u20134, [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Confutation5-9_2014-etext.pdf Books 5\u20139]\n* ''Apology'' (1533) (CW 9)\n* ''Debellation of Salem and Bizance'' (1533) (CW 10) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Debellation2014-etext.pdf pdf]\n* ''The Answer to a Poisoned Book'' (1533) (CW 11) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/AnswerPoisonedBook2014-etext.pdf pdf]\n\n=== Published after More's death (with likely dates of composition) ===\n* ''The History of King Richard III'' (c. 1513\u20131518) (CW 2 & 15)\n* ''The Four Last Things'' (c. 1522) (CW 1)\n* ''[[A Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation]]'' (1534) (CW 12)\n* ''Treatise Upon the Passion'' (1534) (CW 13)\n* ''Treatise on the Blessed Body'' (1535) (CW 13)\n* ''Instructions and Prayers'' (1535) (CW 13)\n* ''De Tristitia Christi'' (1535) (CW 14) (preserved in the [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]], Valencia)\n\n== Translations ==\n* ''Translations of Lucian'' (many dates 1506\u20131534) (CW 3, Pt.1)\n* ''The Life of [[Pico della Mirandola]]'', by Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola (c. 1510) (CW 1)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saints|Biography}}\n* [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)]]\n* [[English Reformation]]\n* [[Moreana]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Biographies ==\n* {{cite book | last = Ackroyd | first = Peter|title= The Life of Thomas More| url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofthomasmore00ackr | url-access = registration |year= 1999 | authorlink = Peter Ackroyd}}\n* {{cite book | last = Basset | first = Bernard, SJ | title = Born for Friendship: The Spirit of Sir Thomas More|year=1965|location=London|publisher=Burns & Oates}}\n* {{cite book | last = Berglar| first = Peter|authorlink= Peter Berglar|title= Thomas More: A Lonely Voice against the Power of the State | publisher = Scepter Publishers | location = New York | year = 2009 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=5eAN_FrS2o4C| isbn = 978-1-59417-073-7}} (Note: this is a 2009 translation (from the original German, by [[Hector de Cavilla]]) of Berglar's 1978 work ''Die Stunde des Thomas Morus \u2013 Einer gegen die Macht''.

In 1980, More was added to the Church of England's [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church]], despite being a fierce opponent of the [[English Reformation]] that created the Church of England. He was added jointly with [[John Fisher]], to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More's execution) as \"Thomas More, scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535\".<ref name=CofEholyDays /> [[Pope John Paul II]] honoured him by making him [[patron saint]] of statesmen and politicians in October 2000, stating: \"It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience... even if, in his actions against heretics, he reflected the limits of the culture of his time\".<ref name=JP2PatronSaint />\n\n=== Resignation ===\nAs the conflict over supremacy between the Papacy and the King reached its apogee, More continued to remain steadfast in supporting the [[Papal supremacy|supremacy of the Pope]] as [[Apostolic succession|Successor of Peter]] over that of the King of England.

In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King]] as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. The bishops at the [[Convocation of Canterbury]] in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of praemunire and only after these words were added: \"as far as Christ law allows\".

In early 1534, More was accused by [[Thomas Cromwell]] of having given advice and counsel to the \"Holy Maid of Kent,\" [[Elizabeth Barton]], a nun who had prophesied that the king had ruined his soul and would come to a quick end for having divorced Queen Catherine.

Retrieved 1 December 2015.</ref>\n\n=== ''Utopia'' ===\n{{Main|Utopia (book)}}\n\nMore's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical \"[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]\" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].\n\nUtopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.\n\n''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.\n\n=== Religious polemics ===\nIn 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225\u20136}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' (\"Defender of the Faith\") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|226\u20137}}\n\nMartin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a \"pig, dolt, and liar\".<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered \"a much steadier personality\",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an \"ape\", a \"drunkard\", and a \"lousy little friar\" amongst other epithets.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:\n\n:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=Alan Dundes |author2=Carl R.

He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|279\u201381}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.\n\nIn 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}}\n\n=== Correspondence ===\nMost major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called \"prison-letters\" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name=\"Gerard\" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.<ref name=\"MoynahanBrian\" />\n\nMore also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.\n\n== Canonization ==\n[[File:MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg|thumb|Medal of Saint Thomas More]]\n\n==={{anchor|Catholic Church}} Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]], and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886.

In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The script has since been published and has had several productions.<ref name=\"Long, William B. 1989 pages 49\">Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''.

Page 1</ref>\n\nThe 20th-century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed Thomas More as the [[tragic hero]] of his 1960 play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''. The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:\n\n<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name=oconnell /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1966, the play ''A Man for All Seasons'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was \"the most difficult part I played.\"<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of \"the common man\" that had been cut from the 1966 film.\n\nCatholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world \"Astrobe\", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: \"He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.\"\n\n[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' (\"Die you fool!\"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.\n\nThe novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nLiterary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as \"cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics\".<ref name=\"Wood2010\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, \"More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.\n\nOther biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].\n\nThe protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is \"Dr Thomas More\", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.\n\nMore is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song \"A Man For All Seasons\" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song \"Sir\", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song \"[[So Says I]]\" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.\n\n[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].<ref name=FishOnline1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/asupplicacyonfo01fishgoog|quote=simon fish.|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=Early English Text Society|last1=Fish|first1=Simon|year=1871}}</ref><ref name=MoreVsFish1>see Fish, Simon. \"Supplycacion for the Beggar.\" 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B.

The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.\n\nIn 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). \"The Tudors on Film and Television\", p. 92.

[[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall]], which was part of More's London residence, was eventually relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect [[Walter Godfrey]] in 1910. Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.\n\n=== Chelsea Old Church ===\n[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]\nAcross a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as \"saint\", \"scholar\", and \"statesman\"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.\n\n=== Tower Hill ===\nA plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.\n\n=== St Katharine Docks ===\nThomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of \"Knighten Guild\", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===\n[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbr\u00fcggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life.

Perhaps the best way to write it would be Hairdakhan but that is not usually done.</ref> in northern [[India]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and taught publicly from 1970 to 1984.\n\n== Life ==\n\nAccording to \"The Teachings of Babaji,\" Haidakhan Babaji \"appeared\" in June 1970 in a cave at the foot of the Kumaon Mount Kailash, across the river Gautama Ganga, near a remote village called Hairakhan, in the [[Nainital district|Nainital]] District of [[Uttrakhand]], India.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"The Teachings of Babaji\", foreword</ref> His followers maintain that Haidakhan Babaji is a Mahavatar \u2013 \"a human manifestation of God, not born from woman.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt is reported that starting in late September 1970 Haidakhan Babaji spent forty-five days meditating in a small temple on the top of the Kumaon Mount Kailash \"without leaving his seat.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In September 1971, Haidakhan Babaji, in a sworn testimony, convinced the judge of the court in Haldwani that he was the \"[[Hariakhan Baba|Old Hariakhan Baba]],\u201d thought to be active in that region in the years 1860\u20131922, and that he had the right to use the [[ashram]]s in Kathgaria and Haidakhan.<ref>Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. PP.125\u2013135.</ref> In 1971 Haidakhan Babaji started travelling across India, proclaiming his Message, performing sacred ceremonies, such as [[yagna]], and attracting more devotees. This included celebrities, such as [[Shammi Kapoor]],<ref>Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. P.158.</ref> and gradually more Westerners.<ref>See for instance: Gaura Devi. (2001). Fire of Transformation. My life with Babaji.</ref>\n\nThough some of his followers<ref>See for instance: Orr, Leonard, 1988, 1995.</ref> believed he was immortal, Haidakhan Babaji took Mahasamadhi on 14 February 1984, local sources would say it appeared to be a heart failure. He was buried in Haidakhan Ashram.  This is how Babaji foretold and explained his death:\n\n{{quote|My body is meant to dry up one day. This body is nothing; it is here only to serve people. (\u2026) Even my own body has come only to perform a duty to serve all human and all living things.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji. 2 February 1983.</ref>}}\n\n== Teachings ==\n\nHaidakhan Babaji maintained that: \"All religions are incorporated in the principle of Truth, Simplicity and Love\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 December 1981</ref> In his living years he taught intensively the importance to live a simple life with loving principles in truth. Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore [[Sanatana Dharma]] rather than Hindu Dharma ([[Hinduism]]).  Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 March 1983.</ref> He explained further: \"I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions. I seek the elevation of all mankind. \"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 29 July 1983.</ref>\n\nHe stressed the unity of all religions as expressed in the following words: \"In any town there is always a central place; all the roads in the town or from out of town lead to that central place. Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 24 December 1981</ref> He said:  \"We are all one with each other and with God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 2 April 1980.</ref> Haidakhan Babaji said: \"You should seek harmony in everything you do. I am harmony. Thank you for your love.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 12 April 1980.</ref><ref>More on this subject can be found in the book: \"I Am Harmony\", by Radhe Shyam (1990).</ref> Haidakhan Babaji proclaimed: \"One can follow any religion, one can follow any practice or path, but one must be humane.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 22 January 1983</ref> He said: \"The world now is in a state of turmoil. It is suffering from three kinds of pain \u2013 physical, mental, spiritual \u2013 and there is only one way of being cured from these. We have to root out inhumanity and replace it with humanity. (\u2026)\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 23 September 1983.</ref> He also made the following statement: \"The only true man is one who practices 'humanism.' (\u2026) this is the only way to success in life.\"<ref name=\"Ibidem_d\">The Teachings of Babaji, 29 October 1983.</ref>\n\nBabaji talked about the importance of hard work and proper performance of one's duty so often that Karma Yoga should be considered the central element of his teachings.  Babaji used to say that: \"Work is worship\"<ref name=\"Babaji 1981\">The Teachings of Babaji, 23 October 1981.</ref> and that hard work is the best spiritual practice.  On another occasion he said: \"If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma \u2013 activity \u2013 is the only thing which can drive out all evils\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 17 November 1983</ref> Babaji also taught that \"perfection in work\" was the real meaning of [[Kriya]] Yoga.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 10 November 1983</ref>\n\n[[Japa|Nama Japa]], the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings. He explained that God's name is the most powerful sound of the Creation \u2013 \"more powerful than a thousand atomic and hydrogen bombs.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 26 December 1982</ref>  \u2013 and that this is the only real thing. Haidakhan Babaji especially recommended the use of the [[mantra]] \"[[\u0950]] nama\u1e25 \u015biv\u0101y\" ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0950 \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f\u094d )<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224203444/http://ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif |archive-date=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \u2013 while \"\u0950\" is mostly [[IAST|transliterated]] as \"o\u1e43\" or \"au\u1e43\") \u2013 because of its protective qualities,<ref>E.g. \"Chant OM NAMAH SHIVAY and you can defy death.\" The Teachings of Babaji, 28 July 1979.</ref> but also stated that one can use any God's name \"his religion teaches.\"<ref>Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji's Teachings. P.6.</ref> The mantra is always written internationally simplified as \"Om Namah Shivay\" in books about Babaji written in [[English language|English]] or other languages.<ref>Maria Gabriele Wosien: ''Ich bin Du \u2013 Botschaften des Meisters vom Himalaya'', G. Reichel Verlag, {{ISBN|3-926388-23-4}}</ref>\n\nHaidakhan Babaji warned his followers about the forthcoming Great Revolution or Maha Kranti. He described Maha Kranti as involving \"earthquakes, floods, accidents, collisions and wars (...).\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 26 July 1979</ref> In the context of these upcoming calamities, he called for courage: \"Walk on with courage and bravery. Go on working to improve humankind and establish the Path of Truth. (\u2026) Fight for truth! To face life you must have great courage every day\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 16 January 1983</ref> Haidakhan Babaji urged his followers to be \"inspired.\" He stated: \"Everything in this world is 'PHURO' \u2013 transient. It has no reality. True reality is to proceed on the path of truth, to keep the company of saintly people, and to render service to men.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983</ref>\n\nBabaji advocated on behalf of the less-fortunate. He stated: \"you should look to the areas of your countries where people are poverty-stricken and helpless and then do all you can to raise their standard of living, teaching them cleanliness and high morals. To serve the needy truly and from the heart is true service to God. (...)\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 20 April 1983</ref>\n\n== Spiritual routine ==\n\nBabaji would typically start his day around 3:00&nbsp;am, with a bath, often in cold Gautama Ganga, which was followed by meditation or a fire ceremony. Around 5:00&nbsp;am he would see his devotees for ceremonial chandan (placing a mark on forehead), followed by morning [[Aarti]] (devotional singing) around 6:00&nbsp;am. Then until noon everybody would be engaged in some form of karma yoga. At noon the only meal of the day was being served, followed by more karma yoga in the afternoon. Sometimes a more elaborate ceremony such as [[havan]] would be performed around the noon time. Havan is a fire ceremony.<ref>http://sanskrit.org/the-fire-ritual-havanhoma/</ref> In the afternoon, Babaji would sometimes see the devotees for individual audiences, known as [[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]. Then there would be another bath, followed by the evening Aarti. After the evening Aarti, Babaji was giving short speeches that were recorded in \"The Teachings of Babaji.\"<ref>For more description of daily routines around Babaji see also Gaura Devi (2001), for instance PP.63\u201367, 73.</ref>\n\n== Identity ==\nHaidakhan Babaji was often asked who he was. He made the following assertions about himself:\n\nOld Hairakhan Baba \u2013 as mentioned above Haidakhan Babaji maintained that he was identical with [[Hairakhan Baba]] (also spelled as Hariakhan or Heriakhan) who lived around Hairakhan in the years 1860\u20131922.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword. See also Radhe Shyam. (1990). PP.50\u201365.</ref>\n\nMahavatar Babaji  \u2013 it appears that Haidakhan Babaji pointed out or implied a few times that he was identical with [[Mahavatar Babaji]] described in Yogandanda's \"Autobiography of a Yogi.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword.</ref> This claim is apparently disputed by the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]], the society founded by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]].<ref name=\"RadheShyam\">Radhe Shyam. (1990). P.xvi.</ref> The practices of these latter differ. Those by Baba Haidakhan were much simpler and did not involve any secret ceremony.\n\nMessenger \u2013 Haidakhan Babaji would sometimes refer to himself as \"messenger of revolution\"<ref name=\"RadheShyam\" /> He often urged the followers to \"spread his Message.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, e.g. 14 September 1981.</ref>\n  \nMahaprabhuji \u2013 on one occasion Babaji stated: \"I am Bhole Baba (Simple Father). I am nobody and nothing. I am only like a mirror in which you can see yourself. I am like a fire. Don\u2019t keep too far away or you will not get warmth. But don\u2019t get too near or you may burn yourself. Learn the right distance. My name is Maha Prabhuji (The Great God).\"<ref>Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji\u2019s Teachings. P.7.</ref> Vishnu Dutt Shastriji said the following about Mahaprabhuji: \"Sitting here at Haidakhan, Mahaprabhuji has control over every particle of the Creation by the power of His mere wish, by His very thought. (...) Mahaprabhuji has control over the elements, the spiritual world \u2013 to say nothing of the world of men. He is the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer of the world. Not a single blade of grass can grow but that He wills it. He has incarnated in a human body for the welfare of mankind. His sole desire \u2013 is to make it possible for the whole world to be liberated. He shall do His utmost to achieve liberation of the world.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983.</ref>\n  \n \nThe Guru of all Gurus \u2013 Gaura Devi recorded Babaji saying: \"I am no one\u2019s Guru, but I am the Guru of gurus.\"<ref>Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji\u2019s Teachings. P.9.</ref>\n \nI am everywhere \u2013 Haidakhan Babaji was recorded saying: \"I am everywhere \u2013 in your every breath. I have come to help you realize unity beyond division. I will show you a freedom you have not imagined. You must seek that unity from whence there is awareness that we are all one. Seek harmony in all that you do. I am harmony. If you are in peace, I am in peace. If you are troubled, I am troubled. If you are happy, I am happy. Be happy. Have faith \u2013 everything depends on faith.\"<ref>Babaji Mahavatar. \"The descent of Eternity into time.\" (1983). Back cover.

Perhaps the best way to write it would be Hairdakhan but that is not usually done.</ref> in northern [[India]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and taught publicly from 1970 to 1984.\n\n== Life ==\n\nAccording to \"The Teachings of Babaji,\" Haidakhan Babaji \"appeared\" in June 1970 in a cave at the foot of the Kumaon Mount Kailash, across the river Gautama Ganga, near a remote village called Hairakhan, in the [[Nainital district|Nainital]] District of [[Uttrakhand]], India.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"The Teachings of Babaji\", foreword</ref> His followers maintain that Haidakhan Babaji is a Mahavatar \u2013 \"a human manifestation of God, not born from woman.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt is reported that starting in late September 1970 Haidakhan Babaji spent forty-five days meditating in a small temple on the top of the Kumaon Mount Kailash \"without leaving his seat.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In September 1971, Haidakhan Babaji, in a sworn testimony, convinced the judge of the court in Haldwani that he was the \"[[Hariakhan Baba|Old Hariakhan Baba]],\u201d thought to be active in that region in the years 1860\u20131922, and that he had the right to use the [[ashram]]s in Kathgaria and Haidakhan.<ref>Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. PP.125\u2013135.</ref> In 1971 Haidakhan Babaji started travelling across India, proclaiming his Message, performing sacred ceremonies, such as [[yagna]], and attracting more devotees. This included celebrities, such as [[Shammi Kapoor]],<ref>Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. P.158.</ref> and gradually more Westerners.<ref>See for instance: Gaura Devi. (2001). Fire of Transformation. My life with Babaji.</ref>\n\nThough some of his followers<ref>See for instance: Orr, Leonard, 1988, 1995.</ref> believed he was immortal, Haidakhan Babaji took Mahasamadhi on 14 February 1984, local sources would say it appeared to be a heart failure. He was buried in Haidakhan Ashram.  This is how Babaji foretold and explained his death:\n\n{{quote|My body is meant to dry up one day. This body is nothing; it is here only to serve people. (\u2026) Even my own body has come only to perform a duty to serve all human and all living things.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji. 2 February 1983.</ref>}}\n\n== Teachings ==\n\nHaidakhan Babaji maintained that: \"All religions are incorporated in the principle of Truth, Simplicity and Love\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 December 1981</ref> In his living years he taught intensively the importance to live a simple life with loving principles in truth. Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore [[Sanatana Dharma]] rather than Hindu Dharma ([[Hinduism]]).  Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 March 1983.</ref> He explained further: \"I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions. I seek the elevation of all mankind. \"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 29 July 1983.</ref>\n\nHe stressed the unity of all religions as expressed in the following words: \"In any town there is always a central place; all the roads in the town or from out of town lead to that central place. Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 24 December 1981</ref> He said:  \"We are all one with each other and with God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 2 April 1980.</ref> Haidakhan Babaji said: \"You should seek harmony in everything you do. I am harmony. Thank you for your love.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 12 April 1980.</ref><ref>More on this subject can be found in the book: \"I Am Harmony\", by Radhe Shyam (1990).</ref> Haidakhan Babaji proclaimed: \"One can follow any religion, one can follow any practice or path, but one must be humane.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 22 January 1983</ref> He said: \"The world now is in a state of turmoil. It is suffering from three kinds of pain \u2013 physical, mental, spiritual \u2013 and there is only one way of being cured from these. We have to root out inhumanity and replace it with humanity. (\u2026)\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 23 September 1983.</ref> He also made the following statement: \"The only true man is one who practices 'humanism.' (\u2026) this is the only way to success in life.\"<ref name=\"Ibidem_d\">The Teachings of Babaji, 29 October 1983.</ref>\n\nBabaji talked about the importance of hard work and proper performance of one's duty so often that Karma Yoga should be considered the central element of his teachings.  Babaji used to say that: \"Work is worship\"<ref name=\"Babaji 1981\">The Teachings of Babaji, 23 October 1981.</ref> and that hard work is the best spiritual practice.  On another occasion he said: \"If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma \u2013 activity \u2013 is the only thing which can drive out all evils\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 17 November 1983</ref> Babaji also taught that \"perfection in work\" was the real meaning of [[Kriya]] Yoga.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 10 November 1983</ref>\n\n[[Japa|Nama Japa]], the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings. He explained that God's name is the most powerful sound of the Creation \u2013 \"more powerful than a thousand atomic and hydrogen bombs.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 26 December 1982</ref>  \u2013 and that this is the only real thing. Haidakhan Babaji especially recommended the use of the [[mantra]] \"[[\u0950]] nama\u1e25 \u015biv\u0101y\" ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0950 \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f\u094d )<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224203444/http://ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif |archive-date=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \u2013 while \"\u0950\" is mostly [[IAST|transliterated]] as \"o\u1e43\" or \"au\u1e43\") \u2013 because of its protective qualities,<ref>E.g. \"Chant OM NAMAH SHIVAY and you can defy death.\" The Teachings of Babaji, 28 July 1979.</ref> but also stated that one can use any God's name \"his religion teaches.\"<ref>Gaura Devi.

Reichel Verlag, {{ISBN|3-926388-23-4}}</ref>\n\nHaidakhan Babaji warned his followers about the forthcoming Great Revolution or Maha Kranti. He described Maha Kranti as involving \"earthquakes, floods, accidents, collisions and wars (...).\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 26 July 1979</ref> In the context of these upcoming calamities, he called for courage: \"Walk on with courage and bravery. Go on working to improve humankind and establish the Path of Truth. (\u2026) Fight for truth! To face life you must have great courage every day\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 16 January 1983</ref> Haidakhan Babaji urged his followers to be \"inspired.\" He stated: \"Everything in this world is 'PHURO' \u2013 transient. It has no reality. True reality is to proceed on the path of truth, to keep the company of saintly people, and to render service to men.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983</ref>\n\nBabaji advocated on behalf of the less-fortunate. He stated: \"you should look to the areas of your countries where people are poverty-stricken and helpless and then do all you can to raise their standard of living, teaching them cleanliness and high morals. To serve the needy truly and from the heart is true service to God. (...)\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 20 April 1983</ref>\n\n== Spiritual routine ==\n\nBabaji would typically start his day around 3:00&nbsp;am, with a bath, often in cold Gautama Ganga, which was followed by meditation or a fire ceremony. Around 5:00&nbsp;am he would see his devotees for ceremonial chandan (placing a mark on forehead), followed by morning [[Aarti]] (devotional singing) around 6:00&nbsp;am. Then until noon everybody would be engaged in some form of karma yoga. At noon the only meal of the day was being served, followed by more karma yoga in the afternoon. Sometimes a more elaborate ceremony such as [[havan]] would be performed around the noon time. Havan is a fire ceremony.<ref>http://sanskrit.org/the-fire-ritual-havanhoma/</ref> In the afternoon, Babaji would sometimes see the devotees for individual audiences, known as [[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]. Then there would be another bath, followed by the evening Aarti. After the evening Aarti, Babaji was giving short speeches that were recorded in \"The Teachings of Babaji.\"<ref>For more description of daily routines around Babaji see also Gaura Devi (2001), for instance PP.63\u201367, 73.</ref>\n\n== Identity ==\nHaidakhan Babaji was often asked who he was. He made the following assertions about himself:\n\nOld Hairakhan Baba \u2013 as mentioned above Haidakhan Babaji maintained that he was identical with [[Hairakhan Baba]] (also spelled as Hariakhan or Heriakhan) who lived around Hairakhan in the years 1860\u20131922.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword. See also Radhe Shyam. (1990). PP.50\u201365.</ref>\n\nMahavatar Babaji  \u2013 it appears that Haidakhan Babaji pointed out or implied a few times that he was identical with [[Mahavatar Babaji]] described in Yogandanda's \"Autobiography of a Yogi.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword.</ref> This claim is apparently disputed by the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]], the society founded by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]].<ref name=\"RadheShyam\">Radhe Shyam. (1990). P.xvi.</ref> The practices of these latter differ. Those by Baba Haidakhan were much simpler and did not involve any secret ceremony.\n\nMessenger \u2013 Haidakhan Babaji would sometimes refer to himself as \"messenger of revolution\"<ref name=\"RadheShyam\" /> He often urged the followers to \"spread his Message.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, e.g. 14 September 1981.</ref>\n  \nMahaprabhuji \u2013 on one occasion Babaji stated: \"I am Bhole Baba (Simple Father). I am nobody and nothing. I am only like a mirror in which you can see yourself. I am like a fire. Don\u2019t keep too far away or you will not get warmth. But don\u2019t get too near or you may burn yourself. Learn the right distance. My name is Maha Prabhuji (The Great God).\"<ref>Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji\u2019s Teachings. P.7.</ref> Vishnu Dutt Shastriji said the following about Mahaprabhuji: \"Sitting here at Haidakhan, Mahaprabhuji has control over every particle of the Creation by the power of His mere wish, by His very thought. (...) Mahaprabhuji has control over the elements, the spiritual world \u2013 to say nothing of the world of men. He is the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer of the world. Not a single blade of grass can grow but that He wills it. He has incarnated in a human body for the welfare of mankind. His sole desire \u2013 is to make it possible for the whole world to be liberated. He shall do His utmost to achieve liberation of the world.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983.</ref>\n  \n \nThe Guru of all Gurus \u2013 Gaura Devi recorded Babaji saying: \"I am no one\u2019s Guru, but I am the Guru of gurus.\"<ref>Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji\u2019s Teachings. P.9.</ref>\n \nI am everywhere \u2013 Haidakhan Babaji was recorded saying: \"I am everywhere \u2013 in your every breath. I have come to help you realize unity beyond division. I will show you a freedom you have not imagined. You must seek that unity from whence there is awareness that we are all one. Seek harmony in all that you do. I am harmony. If you are in peace, I am in peace. If you are troubled, I am troubled. If you are happy, I am happy. Be happy. Have faith \u2013 everything depends on faith.\"<ref>Babaji Mahavatar. \"The descent of Eternity into time.\" (1983). Back cover.

By then, CBS also dropped the name \"Paramount\" from television for good, renaming CBS Paramount Television to CBS Television Studios.  Paramount has also joined up with Trifecta.
