Page 35.

Hayden had started the year with the same clutch as Pedrosa, but four rounds later it was shelved in favor of a clutch Hayden had used in previous years; at the Brno round, he had a problem with the clutch that contributed to a 9th-place finish. Honda and Hayden had difficulty finding a clutch that would allow a good launch at the start but also work well throughout the race. Hayden eventually won the rider championship and Honda reclaimed the constructors' championship.<ref>Spalding, N.: \"The Ghost Bike\". ''MotoGP Season Review 2006''. Pages 26\u201329.

Hayden had started the year with the same clutch as Pedrosa, but four rounds later it was shelved in favor of a clutch Hayden had used in previous years; at the Brno round, he had a problem with the clutch that contributed to a 9th-place finish. Honda and Hayden had difficulty finding a clutch that would allow a good launch at the start but also work well throughout the race.

American aerospace engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] was responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced [[radar cross-section]]. At one point, a [[strategic bomber|bomber]] variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role included [[signals intelligence]] sensors, a [[side-looking airborne radar]], and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General [[Curtis LeMay]], who preferred the SR (''Strategic Reconnaissance'') designation over simply RS (''Reconaissance''). The aircraft was introduced to operational service during January 1966.\n\nDuring [[aerial reconnaissance]] missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes ({{convert|85000|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=comma|abbr=off|sp=us}}) to allow it to outrace threats. If a [[surface-to-air missile]] [[Missile approach warning system|launch was detected]], the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile.<ref name=\"SR71 Blackbird 2006\">\"SR71 Blackbird.\" PBS documentary, Aired: 15 November 2006.</ref> On average, each SR-71 could fly once per week due to the extended turnaround required after mission recovery.

Since its retirement, the SR-71's role has been take up by a combination of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs); a proposed UAV successor, the [[Lockheed Martin SR-72]], has not yet been pursued.

In late 1957, the CIA approached the defense contractor [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] to build an undetectable spy plane. The project, named Archangel, was led by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], head of Lockheed's Skunk Works unit in Burbank, California. The work on project Archangel began in the second quarter of 1958, with aim of flying higher and faster than the U-2. Of 11 successive designs drafted in a span of 10 months, \"A-10\" was the front-runner. Despite this, however, its shape made it vulnerable to radar detection. After a meeting with the CIA in March 1959, the design was modified to have a 90% reduction in radar cross-section. The CIA approved a US$96 million contract for Skunk Works to build a dozen spy planes, named \"[[Lockheed A-12|A-12]]\" on 11 February 1960. The [[1960 U-2 incident|1960 downing]] of [[Francis Gary Powers]]'s U-2 underscored its vulnerability and the need for faster reconnaissance aircraft such as the A-12.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe A-12 first flew at Groom Lake ([[Area 51]]), Nevada, on 25 April 1962. Thirteen were built; two variants were also developed, including three of the [[Lockheed YF-12|YF-12]] interceptor prototype, and two of the [[Lockheed M-21|M-21]] drone carrier. The aircraft was meant to be powered by the [[Pratt & Whitney J58]] engine, but development ran over schedule, and it was equipped instead with the less powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75]] initially. The J58s were retrofitted as they became available, and became the standard powerplant for all subsequent aircraft in the series (A-12, YF-12, M-21), as well as the SR-71. The A-12 flew missions over Vietnam and North Korea before its retirement in 1968. The program's cancellation was announced on 28 December 1966,<ref>McIninch 1996, p. 31.</ref> due both to budget concerns<ref name=\"futile\">Robarge, David.

Mach&nbsp;3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most efficient speed.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\">Johnson 1985</ref> However, in practice the SR-71 was sometimes more efficient at even faster speeds\u2014depending on the outside air temperature\u2014as measured by pounds of fuel burned per nautical mile traveled.

When the aircraft accelerated past Mach&nbsp;1.6, an internal [[jackscrew]] moved the spike up to {{cvt|26|in|cm}} inwards,<ref>[http://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/1/1-31.php \"SR-71 manual, Air Inlet System\"]. sr-71.org.

Moving the spike tip drew the [[shock wave]] riding on it closer to the inlet [[cowling]] until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock wave repeatedly between the spike center body and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow [[spillage]] which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic [[Jet engine#Air intakes|diffuser]].<ref>[http://www.personal.psu.edu/cxc11/SR-71_Engines_J-58.ppt \"Penn State- turbo ramjet engines.\"] ''personal.psu.edu''.

It decelerates further in the divergent duct to give the required speed at entry to the compressor. Capture of the plane's shock wave within the inlet is called \"starting the inlet\". [[Bleed tube]]s and bypass doors were designed into the inlet and engine [[nacelle]]s to handle some of this pressure and to position the final shock to allow the inlet to remain \"started\".\n\n[[File:Inlet shock waves at Mach 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schlieren]] flow visualization at [[unstart]] of axisymmetric inlet at Mach 2]]\nIn the early years of operation, the analog computers would not always keep up with rapidly changing flight environmental inputs. If internal pressures became too great and the spike was incorrectly positioned, the shock wave would suddenly blow out the front of the inlet, called an \"inlet [[unstart]]\". During unstarts, afterburner extinctions were common. The remaining engine's asymmetrical thrust would cause the aircraft to yaw violently to one side. [[Stability Augmentation System|SAS]], autopilot, and manual control inputs would fight the yawing, but often the extreme off-angle would reduce airflow in the opposite engine and stimulate \"sympathetic stalls\". This generated a rapid counter-yawing, often coupled with loud \"banging\" noises, and a rough ride during which crews' helmets would sometimes strike their cockpit canopies.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p42-3\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> One response to a single unstart was unstarting both inlets to prevent yawing, then restarting them both.<ref name=landis_jenkins_p97>Landis and Jenkins 2005, p. 97.</ref> After wind tunnel testing and computer modeling by NASA Dryden test center,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-17-DFRC.html |title=NASA Dryden Technology Facts - YF-12 Flight Research Program |publisher=NASA |location=US |year=2004 |access-date=9 March 2019}}</ref> Lockheed installed an electronic control to detect unstart conditions and perform this reset action without pilot intervention.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 221.</ref> During troubleshooting of the unstart issue, NASA also discovered the vortices from the nose chines were entering the engine and interfering with engine efficiency.

The shock waves generated slowed the air to subsonic speeds relative to the engine. The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the fourth compressor stage and went straight to the afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining five compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber.

The aircraft was flown to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]] in March 1990.\n\nThe USAF could fly each SR-71, on average, once per week, because of the extended turnaround required after mission recovery.  Very often an aircraft would return with rivets missing, delaminated panels or other broken parts such as inlets requiring repair or replacement. There were cases of the aircraft not being ready to fly again for a month due to the repairs needed. Rob Vermeland, [[Lockheed Martin]]'s manager of Advanced Development Program, said in an interview in 2015 that high-tempo operations were not realistic for the SR-71. \"If we had one sitting in the hangar here and the crew chief was told there was a mission planned right now, then 19 hours later it would be safely ready to take off.\"<ref>Norros, Guy, \"Hyper ops\", ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', 20 July \u2013 2 August 2015, p. 28.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the Blackbird's reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam and Laos in 1968, the SR-71s averaged approximately one [[sortie]] a week for nearly two years.

The aircraft, which was at 20&nbsp;km altitude, quickly lost altitude and turned 180\u00b0 to the left and turned over Gotland to search for the Swedish coast. Thus, Swedish airspace was violated, whereupon two armed Saab JA 37 Viggens on an exercise at the height of V\u00e4stervik were ordered there. The mission was to do an incident preparedness check and identify an aircraft of high interest. It was found that the plane was in obvious distress and a decision was made that the Swedish Air Force would escort the plane out of the Baltic Sea. A second round of armed JA-37s from \u00c4ngelholm replaced the first pair and completed the escort to Danish airspace. The event had been classified for over 30 years, and when the report was unsealed, data from the NSA showed that a few [[MiG-25]]s with the order to shoot down the SR-71 or force it to land, had started right after the engine failure. A MiG-25 had locked a missile on the damaged SR-71, but as the aircraft was under escort, no missiles were fired.

(In order to be selected into the SR-71 program in the first place, a pilot or navigator (RSO) had to be a top-quality USAF officer, so continuing career progression for members of this elite group was not surprising.) These generals were adept at communicating the value of the SR-71 to an USAF command staff and a Congress who often lacked a basic understanding of how the SR-71 worked and what it did. However, by the mid-1980s, these SR-71 generals all had retired, and a new generation of USAF generals wanted to cut the program's budget and spend its funding on new [[strategic bomber]] programs instead, especially the very expensive [[B-2 Spirit]].<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe USAF saw the SR-71 as a bargaining chip which could be sacrificed to ensure the survival of other priorities. Also, the SR-71 program's \"product\", which was operational and strategic intelligence, was not seen by these generals as being very valuable to the USAF. The primary consumers of this intelligence were the CIA, NSA, and DIA. A general misunderstanding of the nature of aerial reconnaissance and a lack of knowledge about the SR-71 in particular (due to its secretive development and operations) was used by detractors to discredit the aircraft, with the assurance given that a replacement was under development. [[Dick Cheney]] told the Senate Appropriations Committee that the SR-71 cost $85,000 per hour to operate.<ref>Marshall, Eliot, \"The Blackbird's Wake\", Air & Space, October/November 1990, p. 35.</ref> Opponents estimated the aircraft's support cost at $400 to $700 million per year, though the cost was actually closer to $300 million.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe SR-71, while much more capable than the Lockheed U-2 in terms of range, speed, and survivability, suffered the lack of a [[data link]], which the U-2 had been upgraded to carry. This meant that much of the SR-71's imagery and radar data could not be used in real time, but had to wait until the aircraft returned to base. This lack of immediate real-time capability was used as one of the justifications to close down the program. Attempts to add a datalink to the SR-71 were stymied early on by the same factions in the Pentagon and Congress who were already set on the program's demise, even in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> These same factions also forced expensive sensor upgrades to the SR-71, which did little to increase its mission capabilities, but could be used as justification for complaining about the cost of the program.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nIn 1988, Congress was convinced to allocate $160,000 to keep six SR-71s and a trainer model in flyable storage that could become flightworthy within 60 days. However, the USAF refused to spend the money. While the SR-71 survived attempts to retire it in 1988, partly due to the unmatched ability to provide high-quality coverage of the Kola Peninsula for the US Navy,<ref name=\"Crickmore_p84-5\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> the decision to retire the SR-71 from active duty came in 1989, with the last missions flown in October that year.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p81\">Crickmore 1997, p. 81.</ref> Four months after the plane's retirement, General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], was told that the expedited reconnaissance, which the SR-71 could have provided, was unavailable during [[Operation Desert Storm]].<ref name=\"Remak\">Remak and Ventolo 2001, {{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe SR-71 program's main operational capabilities came to a close at the end of fiscal year 1989 (October 1989).

They maintained that, in a time of constrained military budgets, designing, building, and testing an aircraft with the same capabilities as the SR-71 would be impossible.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham 1996</ref>\n\nCongress's disappointment with the lack of a suitable replacement for the Blackbird was cited concerning whether to continue funding imaging sensors on the U-2. Congressional conferees stated the \"experience with the SR-71 serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of failing to keep existing systems up-to-date and capable in the hope of acquiring other capabilities.\"<ref name=\"Graham\"/> It was agreed to add $100 million to the budget to return three SR-71s to service, but it was emphasized that this \"would not prejudice support for long-endurance [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] [such as the [[Global Hawk]]].\" The funding was later cut to $72.5 million.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> The Skunk Works was able to return the aircraft to service under budget at $72 million.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins 2001</ref>\n\nRetired USAF Colonel Jay Murphy was made the Program Manager for Lockheed's reactivation plans. Retired USAF Colonels Don Emmons and Barry MacKean were put under government contract to remake the plane's logistic and support structure. Still-active USAF pilots and Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSOs) who had worked with the aircraft were asked to volunteer to fly the reactivated planes. The aircraft was under the command and control of the [[9th Reconnaissance Wing]] at Beale Air Force Base and flew out of a renovated hangar at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Modifications were made to provide a data-link with \"near real-time\" transmission of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar's imagery to sites on the ground.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n===Final retirement===\nThe reactivation met much resistance: the USAF had not budgeted for the aircraft, and UAV developers worried that their programs would suffer if money was shifted to support the SR-71s. Also, with the allocation requiring yearly reaffirmation by Congress, long-term planning for the SR-71 was difficult.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> In 1996, the USAF claimed that specific funding had not been authorized, and moved to ground the program. Congress reauthorized the funds, but, in October 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted to use the [[line-item veto]] to cancel the $39 million allocated for the SR-71. In June 1998, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Clinton v. City of New York|line-item veto was unconstitutional]]. All this left the SR-71's status uncertain until September 1998, when the USAF called for the funds to be redistributed; the USAF permanently retired it in 1998.\n\n[[NASA]] operated the two last airworthy Blackbirds until 1999.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-030-DFRC.html \"NASA/DFRC SR-71 Blackbird.\"] ''NASA''.

The limitations of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s, which take up to 24 hours to arrive in the proper orbit to photograph a particular target, make them slower to respond to demand than reconnaissance planes.

Retrieved: 14 March 2010.</ref>\n\nThe SR71 was developed as a [[black project]] from the [[Lockheed A-12]] reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's [[Skunk Works]] division. American aerospace engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] was responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced [[radar cross-section]]. At one point, a [[strategic bomber|bomber]] variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role included [[signals intelligence]] sensors, a [[side-looking airborne radar]], and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General [[Curtis LeMay]], who preferred the SR (''Strategic Reconnaissance'') designation over simply RS (''Reconaissance''). The aircraft was introduced to operational service during January 1966.\n\nDuring [[aerial reconnaissance]] missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes ({{convert|85000|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=comma|abbr=off|sp=us}}) to allow it to outrace threats. If a [[surface-to-air missile]] [[Missile approach warning system|launch was detected]], the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile.<ref name=\"SR71 Blackbird 2006\">\"SR71 Blackbird.\" PBS documentary, Aired: 15 November 2006.</ref> On average, each SR-71 could fly once per week due to the extended turnaround required after mission recovery.

NASA was the final operator of the time, retiring their examples in 1999. Since its retirement, the SR-71's role has been take up by a combination of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs); a proposed UAV successor, the [[Lockheed Martin SR-72]], has not yet been pursued.

In late 1957, the CIA approached the defense contractor [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] to build an undetectable spy plane. The project, named Archangel, was led by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], head of Lockheed's Skunk Works unit in Burbank, California. The work on project Archangel began in the second quarter of 1958, with aim of flying higher and faster than the U-2. Of 11 successive designs drafted in a span of 10 months, \"A-10\" was the front-runner. Despite this, however, its shape made it vulnerable to radar detection. After a meeting with the CIA in March 1959, the design was modified to have a 90% reduction in radar cross-section. The CIA approved a US$96 million contract for Skunk Works to build a dozen spy planes, named \"[[Lockheed A-12|A-12]]\" on 11 February 1960. The [[1960 U-2 incident|1960 downing]] of [[Francis Gary Powers]]'s U-2 underscored its vulnerability and the need for faster reconnaissance aircraft such as the A-12.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe A-12 first flew at Groom Lake ([[Area 51]]), Nevada, on 25 April 1962. Thirteen were built; two variants were also developed, including three of the [[Lockheed YF-12|YF-12]] interceptor prototype, and two of the [[Lockheed M-21|M-21]] drone carrier. The aircraft was meant to be powered by the [[Pratt & Whitney J58]] engine, but development ran over schedule, and it was equipped instead with the less powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75]] initially. The J58s were retrofitted as they became available, and became the standard powerplant for all subsequent aircraft in the series (A-12, YF-12, M-21), as well as the SR-71.

Mach&nbsp;3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most efficient speed.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\">Johnson 1985</ref> However, in practice the SR-71 was sometimes more efficient at even faster speeds\u2014depending on the outside air temperature\u2014as measured by pounds of fuel burned per nautical mile traveled.

When the aircraft accelerated past Mach&nbsp;1.6, an internal [[jackscrew]] moved the spike up to {{cvt|26|in|cm}} inwards,<ref>[http://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/1/1-31.php \"SR-71 manual, Air Inlet System\"]. sr-71.org.

Moving the spike tip drew the [[shock wave]] riding on it closer to the inlet [[cowling]] until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock wave repeatedly between the spike center body and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow [[spillage]] which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic [[Jet engine#Air intakes|diffuser]].<ref>[http://www.personal.psu.edu/cxc11/SR-71_Engines_J-58.ppt \"Penn State- turbo ramjet engines.\"] ''personal.psu.edu''.

It decelerates further in the divergent duct to give the required speed at entry to the compressor. Capture of the plane's shock wave within the inlet is called \"starting the inlet\". [[Bleed tube]]s and bypass doors were designed into the inlet and engine [[nacelle]]s to handle some of this pressure and to position the final shock to allow the inlet to remain \"started\".\n\n[[File:Inlet shock waves at Mach 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schlieren]] flow visualization at [[unstart]] of axisymmetric inlet at Mach 2]]\nIn the early years of operation, the analog computers would not always keep up with rapidly changing flight environmental inputs. If internal pressures became too great and the spike was incorrectly positioned, the shock wave would suddenly blow out the front of the inlet, called an \"inlet [[unstart]]\". During unstarts, afterburner extinctions were common. The remaining engine's asymmetrical thrust would cause the aircraft to yaw violently to one side. [[Stability Augmentation System|SAS]], autopilot, and manual control inputs would fight the yawing, but often the extreme off-angle would reduce airflow in the opposite engine and stimulate \"sympathetic stalls\". This generated a rapid counter-yawing, often coupled with loud \"banging\" noises, and a rough ride during which crews' helmets would sometimes strike their cockpit canopies.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p42-3\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> One response to a single unstart was unstarting both inlets to prevent yawing, then restarting them both.<ref name=landis_jenkins_p97>Landis and Jenkins 2005, p. 97.</ref> After wind tunnel testing and computer modeling by NASA Dryden test center,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-17-DFRC.html |title=NASA Dryden Technology Facts - YF-12 Flight Research Program |publisher=NASA |location=US |year=2004 |access-date=9 March 2019}}</ref> Lockheed installed an electronic control to detect unstart conditions and perform this reset action without pilot intervention.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 221.</ref> During troubleshooting of the unstart issue, NASA also discovered the vortices from the nose chines were entering the engine and interfering with engine efficiency.

The shock waves generated slowed the air to subsonic speeds relative to the engine. The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the fourth compressor stage and went straight to the afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining five compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber. After passing through the turbine, the exhaust, together with the compressor [[bleed air]], entered the afterburner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/1/1-20.php|title=SR-71 Online - SR-71 Flight Manual: Section 1, Page 1-20|website=Sr-71.org}}</ref>\n\nAt around Mach&nbsp;3, the temperature rise from the intake compression, added to the engine compressor temperature rise, reduced the allowable fuel flow because the turbine temperature limit did not change.

The aircraft was flown to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]] in March 1990.\n\nThe USAF could fly each SR-71, on average, once per week, because of the extended turnaround required after mission recovery.  Very often an aircraft would return with rivets missing, delaminated panels or other broken parts such as inlets requiring repair or replacement. There were cases of the aircraft not being ready to fly again for a month due to the repairs needed. Rob Vermeland, [[Lockheed Martin]]'s manager of Advanced Development Program, said in an interview in 2015 that high-tempo operations were not realistic for the SR-71. \"If we had one sitting in the hangar here and the crew chief was told there was a mission planned right now, then 19 hours later it would be safely ready to take off.\"<ref>Norros, Guy, \"Hyper ops\", ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', 20 July \u2013 2 August 2015, p. 28.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the Blackbird's reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam and Laos in 1968, the SR-71s averaged approximately one [[sortie]] a week for nearly two years.

The aircraft, which was at 20&nbsp;km altitude, quickly lost altitude and turned 180\u00b0 to the left and turned over Gotland to search for the Swedish coast. Thus, Swedish airspace was violated, whereupon two armed Saab JA 37 Viggens on an exercise at the height of V\u00e4stervik were ordered there. The mission was to do an incident preparedness check and identify an aircraft of high interest. It was found that the plane was in obvious distress and a decision was made that the Swedish Air Force would escort the plane out of the Baltic Sea. A second round of armed JA-37s from \u00c4ngelholm replaced the first pair and completed the escort to Danish airspace. The event had been classified for over 30 years, and when the report was unsealed, data from the NSA showed that a few [[MiG-25]]s with the order to shoot down the SR-71 or force it to land, had started right after the engine failure. A MiG-25 had locked a missile on the damaged SR-71, but as the aircraft was under escort, no missiles were fired.

(In order to be selected into the SR-71 program in the first place, a pilot or navigator (RSO) had to be a top-quality USAF officer, so continuing career progression for members of this elite group was not surprising.) These generals were adept at communicating the value of the SR-71 to an USAF command staff and a Congress who often lacked a basic understanding of how the SR-71 worked and what it did. However, by the mid-1980s, these SR-71 generals all had retired, and a new generation of USAF generals wanted to cut the program's budget and spend its funding on new [[strategic bomber]] programs instead, especially the very expensive [[B-2 Spirit]].<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe USAF saw the SR-71 as a bargaining chip which could be sacrificed to ensure the survival of other priorities. Also, the SR-71 program's \"product\", which was operational and strategic intelligence, was not seen by these generals as being very valuable to the USAF. The primary consumers of this intelligence were the CIA, NSA, and DIA. A general misunderstanding of the nature of aerial reconnaissance and a lack of knowledge about the SR-71 in particular (due to its secretive development and operations) was used by detractors to discredit the aircraft, with the assurance given that a replacement was under development. [[Dick Cheney]] told the Senate Appropriations Committee that the SR-71 cost $85,000 per hour to operate.<ref>Marshall, Eliot, \"The Blackbird's Wake\", Air & Space, October/November 1990, p. 35.</ref> Opponents estimated the aircraft's support cost at $400 to $700 million per year, though the cost was actually closer to $300 million.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe SR-71, while much more capable than the Lockheed U-2 in terms of range, speed, and survivability, suffered the lack of a [[data link]], which the U-2 had been upgraded to carry. This meant that much of the SR-71's imagery and radar data could not be used in real time, but had to wait until the aircraft returned to base. This lack of immediate real-time capability was used as one of the justifications to close down the program. Attempts to add a datalink to the SR-71 were stymied early on by the same factions in the Pentagon and Congress who were already set on the program's demise, even in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> These same factions also forced expensive sensor upgrades to the SR-71, which did little to increase its mission capabilities, but could be used as justification for complaining about the cost of the program.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nIn 1988, Congress was convinced to allocate $160,000 to keep six SR-71s and a trainer model in flyable storage that could become flightworthy within 60 days. However, the USAF refused to spend the money. While the SR-71 survived attempts to retire it in 1988, partly due to the unmatched ability to provide high-quality coverage of the Kola Peninsula for the US Navy,<ref name=\"Crickmore_p84-5\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> the decision to retire the SR-71 from active duty came in 1989, with the last missions flown in October that year.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p81\">Crickmore 1997, p. 81.</ref> Four months after the plane's retirement, General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], was told that the expedited reconnaissance, which the SR-71 could have provided, was unavailable during [[Operation Desert Storm]].<ref name=\"Remak\">Remak and Ventolo 2001, {{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe SR-71 program's main operational capabilities came to a close at the end of fiscal year 1989 (October 1989).

And the determination was that if one could take advantage of technology and develop a system that could get that data back real time... that would be able to meet the unique requirements of the tactical commander.\" Hall also stated they were \"looking at alternative means of doing [the job of the SR-71].\"<ref name=\"Senate\">\"Department of Defense Authorization for Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1994 and The Future Years.\" ''United States Senate'', May\u2013June 1993.</ref>\n\nMacke told the committee that they were \"flying U-2s, [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135s]], [and] other strategic and tactical assets\" to collect information in some areas.<ref name=\"Senate\"/> Senator [[Robert Byrd]] and other Senators complained that the \"better than\" successor to the SR-71 had yet to be developed at the cost of the \"good enough\" serviceable aircraft. They maintained that, in a time of constrained military budgets, designing, building, and testing an aircraft with the same capabilities as the SR-71 would be impossible.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham 1996</ref>\n\nCongress's disappointment with the lack of a suitable replacement for the Blackbird was cited concerning whether to continue funding imaging sensors on the U-2. Congressional conferees stated the \"experience with the SR-71 serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of failing to keep existing systems up-to-date and capable in the hope of acquiring other capabilities.\"<ref name=\"Graham\"/> It was agreed to add $100 million to the budget to return three SR-71s to service, but it was emphasized that this \"would not prejudice support for long-endurance [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] [such as the [[Global Hawk]]].\" The funding was later cut to $72.5 million.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> The Skunk Works was able to return the aircraft to service under budget at $72 million.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins 2001</ref>\n\nRetired USAF Colonel Jay Murphy was made the Program Manager for Lockheed's reactivation plans. Retired USAF Colonels Don Emmons and Barry MacKean were put under government contract to remake the plane's logistic and support structure. Still-active USAF pilots and Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSOs) who had worked with the aircraft were asked to volunteer to fly the reactivated planes. The aircraft was under the command and control of the [[9th Reconnaissance Wing]] at Beale Air Force Base and flew out of a renovated hangar at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Modifications were made to provide a data-link with \"near real-time\" transmission of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar's imagery to sites on the ground.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n===Final retirement===\nThe reactivation met much resistance: the USAF had not budgeted for the aircraft, and UAV developers worried that their programs would suffer if money was shifted to support the SR-71s. Also, with the allocation requiring yearly reaffirmation by Congress, long-term planning for the SR-71 was difficult.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> In 1996, the USAF claimed that specific funding had not been authorized, and moved to ground the program. Congress reauthorized the funds, but, in October 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted to use the [[line-item veto]] to cancel the $39 million allocated for the SR-71. In June 1998, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Clinton v. City of New York|line-item veto was unconstitutional]]. All this left the SR-71's status uncertain until September 1998, when the USAF called for the funds to be redistributed; the USAF permanently retired it in 1998.\n\n[[NASA]] operated the two last airworthy Blackbirds until 1999.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-030-DFRC.html \"NASA/DFRC SR-71 Blackbird.\"] ''NASA''.

The limitations of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s, which take up to 24 hours to arrive in the proper orbit to photograph a particular target, make them slower to respond to demand than reconnaissance planes. The fly-over orbit of spy satellites may also be predicted and can allow assets to be hidden when the satellite is above, a drawback not shared by aircraft.

Pulleyblank]] describes how ''Yi'' usages semantically changed.  \"Their name furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian' and is sometimes used in such a generalized sense as early as the Spring and Autumn period. At the same time it continued to have a specific reference, denoting especially the Yi of the Huai river region, who constituted a recognized political entity. Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most 'civilized' of the non-Chinese peoples.\"<ref>Pulleyblank, E. G. (1983). \"The Chinese and Their Neighbors in Prehistoric and Early Historic Times\". In Keightley, David N., ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization]''. p. 440. University of California Press.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-Qin usages ====\n[[File:Huaxiasiyi.svg|thumb|[[Zhou dynasty]] cosmography of [[Huaxia]] and the [[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]: Dongyi in the east, [[Nanman]] in the south, [[Xirong]] in the west, and [[Beidi]] in the north.]]\nIt is not easy to determine the times of people that a [[Classical Chinese]] document reflects.\n\nLiterature describing a pre-[[Xia Dynasty]] period does not use the [[Chinese character|character]] ''yi''. As for the Xi\u00e0 Dynasty, some groups of people are referred to as the Yi. For example, the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' chapter of the ''Shu Ji'' or ''[[Book of Documents]]'' terms people in Qingzhou and Xuzhou Laiyi (\u840a\u5937), Yuyi (\u5d4e\u5937) and Huaiyi (\u6dee\u5937). Another yi-related term is Jiu-yi (\u4e5d\u5937), literally ''Nine Yi'', which could have also had the connotation ''The Numerous Yi'' or ''The Many Different Kinds of Yi'', and which appears in a passage in The [[Analects]] that reads, \"The Master (i.e., [[Confucius]]) desired to live among the Nine Yi.\" The term \"Dongyi\" is not used for this period.\n\n[[Shang Dynasty]] oracle shell and bone writings record ''yi'' but not ''Dongyi''. Shima Kunio's [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of oracle inscriptions lists twenty occurrences of the script for \u5937 or \u5c38, most frequently (6 times) in the [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''zhishi'' \u7949\u5c38 \"bless the personator; blessed personator\".<ref>Shima 1971:5.</ref> Michael Carr notes some contexts are ambiguous, but suggests, \"Three compounds refer to 'barbarians' (in modern characters, ''fayi'' \u4f10\u5937 'attack barbarians', ''zhengyi'' \u5f81\u5937 'punish barbarians', and ''yifang'' \u5937\u65b9 'barbarian regions').\"<ref>Carr 2007:381-382</ref> Oracle inscriptions record that Shang King [[Wu Ding]] (r. c. 1250\u20131192 BCE) made military expeditions on the Yi, and King [[Di Xin]] (r. c. 1075\u20131046 BCE) waged a massive campaign against the Yifang \u5937\u65b9 \"barbarian regions\".<ref>{{cite book|title= The Archaeology of Korea By Sarah M. Nelson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sANORB_MSRUC&pg=PA156 }}</ref> It appears that the Yifang were the same people as Huaiyi ([[Huai River]] Yi), Nanhuaiyi (Southern Huai Yi), Nanyi (Southern Yi) and Dongyi according to bronzeware inscriptions of the Western Zhou Dynasty. The [[Zhou Dynasty]] attempted to keep the Yi under its control. The most notable example of which is the successful campaign against the Huaiyi and the Dongyi led by the [[Duke of Zhou]].\n\nOn the other hand, historian Huang Yang notes that in the Shang period, \"the term ''yi'' probably did not carry the sense of 'barbarian'. Rather it simply denoted one of the many tribes or regions that were the target of the Shang military campaigns&nbsp;... We see, therefore, that at the beginning the ''yi'' might haven been certain particular tribe or group of people that was neighboring the Shang.\"<ref>Huang Yang (2013), \"[http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-fellows/2014/03/14/perceptions-of-the-barbarian-in-early-greece-and-china/ Perceptions of the Barbarian in Early Greece and China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017080335/http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-fellows/2014/03/14/perceptions-of-the-barbarian-in-early-greece-and-china/ |date=2014-10-17 }}\", ''CHS Research Bulletin'' 2.1</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spring and Autumn period]], [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Song (state)|Song]] tried to seize control of the Huai River basin, which was occupied by the Huaiyi, but the region ultimately fell under the influence of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] to the south. At the same time, people in the east and south ceased to be called Dongyi as they founded their own states. These Yifang states included the states of [[Xu (state)|Xu]], [[Lai (state)|Lai]], Zhongli, [[Ju (state)|Ju]] and Jiang. The small state of [[Jie (state)|Jie]] was based around present-day [[Jiaozhou City|Jiaozhou]].<ref name=cq>{{citation |last=Legge |first=James |authorlink=James Legge |title=[[:s:The Ch'un Ts'ew|The Ch'un Ts'ew with Tso Chuen]] |series=[[:s:The Chinese Classics|The Chinese Classics]]|volume= V |date=1872 |publisher=Lane, Crawford, & Co. |location=Hong Kong |at=[[:s:The Ch'un Ts'ew/Prolegomena/III|{{abbr|Prol.|Prolegomena}}, Ch. iii, p. 130]] }}.</ref> The state of Xu occupied large areas of modern [[Jiangsu]] and [[Anhui]] provinces between the Huai and Yangtze Rivers. Eventually, after warring with Chu and Wu, it was conquered by the [[State of Wu]] in 512 BC. Chu annexed the State of Jiang, destroyed the State of Ju whose territory was annexed by the State of Qi. Recent archaeological excavations reveal that the State of Xu's presence extended to western Jiangxi in modern Jing'an County. This includes bronzeware inscriptions about the State of Xu and also a tomb with many [[nanmu]] coffins containing sacrificial female victims. Dongyi customs include burials with many sacrificial victims and veneration of the sun.\n\nReferences to Dongyi became ideological during the [[Warring States period]], owing to cultural changes in Chinese concepts of Self and Other. When the (c. 4th BCE) ''[[Classic of Rites]]'' recorded stereotypes about the ''[[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]'' \"Four Barbarians\" (''Dongyi'', ''Xirong'', ''Nanman'', and ''Beidi'') in the four directions, ''Dongyi'' had acquired a clearly pejorative nuance.\n<blockquote>The people of those five regions \u2013 the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi], (and other wild tribes round them) \u2013 had all their several natures, which they could not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called [Yi]. They had their hair unbound, and tattooed their bodies. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked. Those on the south were called Man. They tattooed their foreheads, and had their feet turned in towards each other. Some of them (also) ate their food without its being cooked. Those on the west were called [Rong]. They had their hair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food. Those on the north were called [Di]. They wore skins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them also did not eat grain-food. The people of the Middle states, and of those [Yi], Man, [Rong], and [Di], all had their dwellings, where they lived at ease; their flavours which they preferred; the clothes suitable for them; their proper implements for use; and their vessels which they prepared in abundance. In those five regions, the languages of the people were not mutually intelligible, and their likings and desires were different. To make what was in their minds apprehended, and to communicate their likings and desires, (there were officers) \u2013 in the east, called transmitters; in the south, representationists; in the west, [Di-dis]; and in the north, interpreters.<ref>Wangzhi chap., tr. [[James Legge]] (1879),  ''The Li Ki'', Clarendon Press, vol.1, pp. 229\u2013230.</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==== Post-Qin usages ====\nThe more \"[[China]]\" expanded, the further east the term \"Dongyi\" was applied to. The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]] uses the term \"Manyi\" (\u883b\u5937), but not \"Dongyi\". It puts the section of \"Xinanyi (southwestern Yi) liezhuan (biographies)\", but not \"Dongyi liezhuan\". The ''[[Book of Han]]'' does not put this section either but calls a [[Dongye]] (\u6fca) chief in the Korean Peninsula as Dongyi. The ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' puts the section of \"Dongyi liezhuan (\u6771\u5937\u5217\u50b3)\" and covers [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Sushen|Yilou]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Okjeo|Eastern Okjeo]], Hui, [[Samhan]] and [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]], in other words, eastern [[Manchuria]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and some other islands. The ''[[Book of Jin]]'' positioned Dongyi inside the section of \"Siyi\" (barbarians in four directions) along with \"Xirong\", \"Nanman\" and \"Beidi\". The ''Book of Sui'', the ''Book of Tang'' and the ''New Book of Tang'' adopt the section of \"Dongyi\" and covers eastern Manchuria, Korea, Japan and optionally Sakhalin and Taiwan. During the Song Dynasty, the official history books replaced Dongyi with Waiguo (\u5916\u570b) and Waiyi (\u5916\u5937).\n\n==== Other usage of Dongyi in Chinese history books ====\n; [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and [[Book of Han]]\n: These two history books do not assign many chapters to describe the history of Dongyi. However, it includes the simple description [[Manchuria]], [[Wiman Joseon]] and [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]].

Pulleyblank]] describes how ''Yi'' usages semantically changed.  \"Their name furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian' and is sometimes used in such a generalized sense as early as the Spring and Autumn period. At the same time it continued to have a specific reference, denoting especially the Yi of the Huai river region, who constituted a recognized political entity.

University of California Press.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-Qin usages ====\n[[File:Huaxiasiyi.svg|thumb|[[Zhou dynasty]] cosmography of [[Huaxia]] and the [[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]: Dongyi in the east, [[Nanman]] in the south, [[Xirong]] in the west, and [[Beidi]] in the north.]]\nIt is not easy to determine the times of people that a [[Classical Chinese]] document reflects.\n\nLiterature describing a pre-[[Xia Dynasty]] period does not use the [[Chinese character|character]] ''yi''. As for the Xi\u00e0 Dynasty, some groups of people are referred to as the Yi. For example, the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' chapter of the ''Shu Ji'' or ''[[Book of Documents]]'' terms people in Qingzhou and Xuzhou Laiyi (\u840a\u5937), Yuyi (\u5d4e\u5937) and Huaiyi (\u6dee\u5937). Another yi-related term is Jiu-yi (\u4e5d\u5937), literally ''Nine Yi'', which could have also had the connotation ''The Numerous Yi'' or ''The Many Different Kinds of Yi'', and which appears in a passage in The [[Analects]] that reads, \"The Master (i.e., [[Confucius]]) desired to live among the Nine Yi.\" The term \"Dongyi\" is not used for this period.\n\n[[Shang Dynasty]] oracle shell and bone writings record ''yi'' but not ''Dongyi''. Shima Kunio's [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of oracle inscriptions lists twenty occurrences of the script for \u5937 or \u5c38, most frequently (6 times) in the [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''zhishi'' \u7949\u5c38 \"bless the personator; blessed personator\".<ref>Shima 1971:5.</ref> Michael Carr notes some contexts are ambiguous, but suggests, \"Three compounds refer to 'barbarians' (in modern characters, ''fayi'' \u4f10\u5937 'attack barbarians', ''zhengyi'' \u5f81\u5937 'punish barbarians', and ''yifang'' \u5937\u65b9 'barbarian regions').\"<ref>Carr 2007:381-382</ref> Oracle inscriptions record that Shang King [[Wu Ding]] (r. c. 1250\u20131192 BCE) made military expeditions on the Yi, and King [[Di Xin]] (r. c. 1075\u20131046 BCE) waged a massive campaign against the Yifang \u5937\u65b9 \"barbarian regions\".<ref>{{cite book|title= The Archaeology of Korea By Sarah M.

The [[Zhou Dynasty]] attempted to keep the Yi under its control. The most notable example of which is the successful campaign against the Huaiyi and the Dongyi led by the [[Duke of Zhou]].\n\nOn the other hand, historian Huang Yang notes that in the Shang period, \"the term ''yi'' probably did not carry the sense of 'barbarian'. Rather it simply denoted one of the many tribes or regions that were the target of the Shang military campaigns&nbsp;... We see, therefore, that at the beginning the ''yi'' might haven been certain particular tribe or group of people that was neighboring the Shang.\"<ref>Huang Yang (2013), \"[http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-fellows/2014/03/14/perceptions-of-the-barbarian-in-early-greece-and-china/ Perceptions of the Barbarian in Early Greece and China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017080335/http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-fellows/2014/03/14/perceptions-of-the-barbarian-in-early-greece-and-china/ |date=2014-10-17 }}\", ''CHS Research Bulletin'' 2.1</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spring and Autumn period]], [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Song (state)|Song]] tried to seize control of the Huai River basin, which was occupied by the Huaiyi, but the region ultimately fell under the influence of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] to the south. At the same time, people in the east and south ceased to be called Dongyi as they founded their own states. These Yifang states included the states of [[Xu (state)|Xu]], [[Lai (state)|Lai]], Zhongli, [[Ju (state)|Ju]] and Jiang. The small state of [[Jie (state)|Jie]] was based around present-day [[Jiaozhou City|Jiaozhou]].<ref name=cq>{{citation |last=Legge |first=James |authorlink=James Legge |title=[[:s:The Ch'un Ts'ew|The Ch'un Ts'ew with Tso Chuen]] |series=[[:s:The Chinese Classics|The Chinese Classics]]|volume= V |date=1872 |publisher=Lane, Crawford, & Co. |location=Hong Kong |at=[[:s:The Ch'un Ts'ew/Prolegomena/III|{{abbr|Prol.|Prolegomena}}, Ch. iii, p. 130]] }}.</ref> The state of Xu occupied large areas of modern [[Jiangsu]] and [[Anhui]] provinces between the Huai and Yangtze Rivers. Eventually, after warring with Chu and Wu, it was conquered by the [[State of Wu]] in 512 BC. Chu annexed the State of Jiang, destroyed the State of Ju whose territory was annexed by the State of Qi. Recent archaeological excavations reveal that the State of Xu's presence extended to western Jiangxi in modern Jing'an County. This includes bronzeware inscriptions about the State of Xu and also a tomb with many [[nanmu]] coffins containing sacrificial female victims. Dongyi customs include burials with many sacrificial victims and veneration of the sun.\n\nReferences to Dongyi became ideological during the [[Warring States period]], owing to cultural changes in Chinese concepts of Self and Other. When the (c. 4th BCE) ''[[Classic of Rites]]'' recorded stereotypes about the ''[[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]'' \"Four Barbarians\" (''Dongyi'', ''Xirong'', ''Nanman'', and ''Beidi'') in the four directions, ''Dongyi'' had acquired a clearly pejorative nuance.\n<blockquote>The people of those five regions \u2013 the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi], (and other wild tribes round them) \u2013 had all their several natures, which they could not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called [Yi]. They had their hair unbound, and tattooed their bodies. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked. Those on the south were called Man. They tattooed their foreheads, and had their feet turned in towards each other. Some of them (also) ate their food without its being cooked. Those on the west were called [Rong]. They had their hair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food. Those on the north were called [Di]. They wore skins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them also did not eat grain-food. The people of the Middle states, and of those [Yi], Man, [Rong], and [Di], all had their dwellings, where they lived at ease; their flavours which they preferred; the clothes suitable for them; their proper implements for use; and their vessels which they prepared in abundance. In those five regions, the languages of the people were not mutually intelligible, and their likings and desires were different. To make what was in their minds apprehended, and to communicate their likings and desires, (there were officers) \u2013 in the east, called transmitters; in the south, representationists; in the west, [Di-dis]; and in the north, interpreters.<ref>Wangzhi chap., tr. [[James Legge]] (1879),  ''The Li Ki'', Clarendon Press, vol.1, pp. 229\u2013230.</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==== Post-Qin usages ====\nThe more \"[[China]]\" expanded, the further east the term \"Dongyi\" was applied to. The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]] uses the term \"Manyi\" (\u883b\u5937), but not \"Dongyi\". It puts the section of \"Xinanyi (southwestern Yi) liezhuan (biographies)\", but not \"Dongyi liezhuan\". The ''[[Book of Han]]'' does not put this section either but calls a [[Dongye]] (\u6fca) chief in the Korean Peninsula as Dongyi. The ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' puts the section of \"Dongyi liezhuan (\u6771\u5937\u5217\u50b3)\" and covers [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Sushen|Yilou]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Okjeo|Eastern Okjeo]], Hui, [[Samhan]] and [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]], in other words, eastern [[Manchuria]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and some other islands. The ''[[Book of Jin]]'' positioned Dongyi inside the section of \"Siyi\" (barbarians in four directions) along with \"Xirong\", \"Nanman\" and \"Beidi\". The ''Book of Sui'', the ''Book of Tang'' and the ''New Book of Tang'' adopt the section of \"Dongyi\" and covers eastern Manchuria, Korea, Japan and optionally Sakhalin and Taiwan. During the Song Dynasty, the official history books replaced Dongyi with Waiguo (\u5916\u570b) and Waiyi (\u5916\u5937).\n\n==== Other usage of Dongyi in Chinese history books ====\n; [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and [[Book of Han]]\n: These two history books do not assign many chapters to describe the history of Dongyi. However, it includes the simple description [[Manchuria]], [[Wiman Joseon]] and [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]. Wiman fled from the [[state of Yan]] to [[Gojoseon]], and he disguised himself as a [[Gojoseon]] person.

The triangle represented the school; it was equilateral to show the school's commitment to equality of opportunity (as one of Dundee's first comprehensive schools, it did not select its pupils based on academic ability).  \n\nThe trapezoids represented the buildings immediately surrounding the school in Menzieshill, many of which were grey and trapezoidal, whilst the green represented the abundant grassland that characterized the area.  \n\nThe badge, therefore, showed that the school was at the heart of the community and was supported by it. Together, these elements formed a stylized \"M\" for Menzieshill.<ref>http://menzieshill.ea.dundeecity.sch.uk/school/documents/files/school-handbook-2013/view   Page 6</ref>\n\nOriginally, the school colours were those of the school badge \u2013 bottle green, grey, and red \u2013 with the addition of black.  The bottle-green blazers were highly distinctive but were later replaced by more traditional black ones. In the 1970s, the school uniform stipulated that other items had to be in \"the school colours\", which allowed pupils of both sexes to dress entirely (shirt, jumper, and trousers) in bottle-green or bright red if they so wished. Later,  the uniform was changed to stipulate black or grey for trousers, although there was some leeway for \"self-coloured\" shirts and jumpers.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://menzieshill.ea.dundeecity.sch.uk/ Menzieshill High School homepage]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080510204736/http://www.scottishschoolsonline.gov.uk/schools/menzieshillhighschooldundeecity.asp Menzieshill High School's page on Scottish Schools Online]\n\n{{coord|56.4682|-3.0293|type:edu_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n{{Schools in Dundee}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct secondary schools in Dundee]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1971]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2016]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name          = Menzieshill High School\n| image         = Menzieshill.jpg\n| image_size          = \n| caption       =\n| established   = 23 August 1971\n| closed        = 1 July 2016<ref>http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/School%20Holidays%202015-16.pdf</ref>\n| type          = Secondary School\n| religious_affiliation      = [[religion|any]]\n| president     =\n| head_label    = Final Head Teacher\n| head          = Helen Gray\n| r_head_label  = Final Deputy Head Teachers\n| r_head        = T Stewart<br>L Waddell<br>K Archer<br>L Chacko\n| chair_label   =\n| chair         =\n| founder       = \n| specialist    =\n| address        = Yarrow Terrace\n| city          = [[Dundee]]\n| county        = [[Dundee City Council]] (formerly [[Tayside]])\n| country       = Scotland\n| postcode      = DD2 4DW \n| local_authority           = [[Dundee City Council]]\n| dfeno         =\n| urn           =\n| SEED number   = \n| staff         = \n| enrolment    = 596 (2013)\n| gender        = Mixed\n| lower_age     = 11\n| upper_age     = 18\n| houses        = [[Fortingall]]<br>[[Weem]]<br>[[Culdares]]<br>[[Aberfeldy (disambiguation)|Aberfeldy]]\n| colours       = Red green\n| publication   =\n| free_label_2  = School years\n| free_2        = S1 \u2013 S6\n| free_label_3  = \n| free_3        = \n| free_label_4  = \n| free_4        = \n| website       ={{url|menzieshillhighschool.ea.dundeecity.sch.uk/}}\n}}\n\n'''Menzieshill High School''' was a co-educational secondary school located in the Menzieshill area of [[Dundee]], Scotland.

The bottle-green blazers were highly distinctive but were later replaced by more traditional black ones. In the 1970s, the school uniform stipulated that other items had to be in \"the school colours\", which allowed pupils of both sexes to dress entirely (shirt, jumper, and trousers) in bottle-green or bright red if they so wished. Later,  the uniform was changed to stipulate black or grey for trousers, although there was some leeway for \"self-coloured\" shirts and jumpers.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://menzieshill.ea.dundeecity.sch.uk/ Menzieshill High School homepage]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080510204736/http://www.scottishschoolsonline.gov.uk/schools/menzieshillhighschooldundeecity.asp Menzieshill High School's page on Scottish Schools Online]\n\n{{coord|56.4682|-3.0293|type:edu_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n{{Schools in Dundee}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct secondary schools in Dundee]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1971]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2016]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menzieshill_High_School"}

Codenamed \"Project Mars\", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]] until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own [[ROM cartridge]]s and has its own [[List of Sega 32X games|library of games]]. The add-on was distributed under the name {{nihongo foot|'''Super 32X'''|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc32{{ruby|X|\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9}}|S\u016bp\u0101 Sanj\u016bni Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --> in Japan, '''Genesis 32X''' in North America, '''Mega Drive 32X''' in the [[PAL]] region, and '''Mega 32X''' in Brazil.\n\nUnveiled by [[Sega]] at June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the [[Atari Jaguar]] and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful.  The final design contained two 32-bit [[central processing units]] and a 3D&nbsp;graphics processor.  To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party [[video game developer]]s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis [[porting|ports]]. Sega produced 800,000 units of the 32X and managed to sell an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994, selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.\n\nThe 32X is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]]. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.\n\n\n==History==\nThe [[Sega Genesis]], initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42\u201347}}</ref> The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\"/>\n\nAlthough the earlier release of the [[Sega CD]] add-on had been commercially disappointing,<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Retroinspection: Sega 32X|last=McFerran|first=Damien|issue=77|pages=44\u201349}}</ref><ref name=\"EurogamerRAF\">{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|title=The Rise and Fall of Sega Enterprises|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|website=Eurogamer|access-date=May 1, 2014|date=February 22, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216124431/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|archive-date=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Sega began to develop a [[Improvisation|stop-gap]] solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the [[Sega Saturn]], serving as a less expensive entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]].<ref name=\"32XIGN\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=32X Follies|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 24, 2008|access-date=May 25, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417080118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] and broadly supported by Sega of America employees.  According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the [[64-bit]] [[Atari Jaguar]]. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Development===\nDuring the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1994, Sega of America [[research and development]] head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar.  Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz.  One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as \"Project Jupiter\", an entirely new independent console.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the [[Sega Genesis#Sega Virtua Processor|Sega Virtua Processor]] chip.  Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite web|author=Horowitz, Ken|title=Interview: Joe Miller|publisher=Sega-16|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|date=February 7, 2013|access-date=January 10, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233248/http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|archive-date=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, \"Oh, that's just a horrible idea.  If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on.  If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great.  But if the only thing it does is double the colors....\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions.  One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  This would come in the form of an add-on.  From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed \"Project Mars\", was advanced.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nAt the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit [[SuperH]]-2 processors.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\nAlthough the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=EGM Goes One-on-One with Sega's Chief - Tom Kalinske|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|pages=191}}</ref><ref name=\"Allgame32X\" /> Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it \"a coder's dream for the day\" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/> Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan.  Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nBefore the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America.  Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously.  Their answer was to call the 32X a \"transitional device\" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, \"[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Pre-launch promotion, release, and marketing===\n[[Image:Sega-Saturn-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Sega Saturn, released in November 1994.  The 32X was incompatible with Saturn software.]]\nThe unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago.  Promoted as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games\", 32X was marketed for its [[United States dollar|US$]]159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn.  However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software.

According to Buchanan, \"I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one.\"<ref name=\"32XIGN\" />\n\nIn particular, the console's status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers.  ''[[Allgame]]''<nowiki/>'s Scott Alan Marriott states that \"[e]very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales.\"<ref name=\"AllgameCD32X\">{{cite web|author=Marriott, Scott Alan|title=Sega Genesis CD 32X&nbsp;\u2014 Overview|publisher=Allgame|access-date=June 7, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210111102/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=43|archive-date=December 10, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  ''GamePro'' criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system.  According to reviewer Blake Snow, \"Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need?

Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that \"(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Writing for ''IGN'', Buchanan points out, \"Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994?

Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience.\"<ref name=\"32XIGN\" />\n\nFormer executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X.  Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] for doing so.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, \"The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on.  An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, \"I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn\u2019t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons.

Codenamed \"Project Mars\", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]] until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own [[ROM cartridge]]s and has its own [[List of Sega 32X games|library of games]]. The add-on was distributed under the name {{nihongo foot|'''Super 32X'''|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc32{{ruby|X|\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9}}|S\u016bp\u0101 Sanj\u016bni Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --> in Japan, '''Genesis 32X''' in North America, '''Mega Drive 32X''' in the [[PAL]] region, and '''Mega 32X''' in Brazil.\n\nUnveiled by [[Sega]] at June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the [[Atari Jaguar]] and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful.  The final design contained two 32-bit [[central processing units]] and a 3D&nbsp;graphics processor.  To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party [[video game developer]]s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis [[porting|ports]]. Sega produced 800,000 units of the 32X and managed to sell an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994, selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.\n\nThe 32X is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]]. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Sega Genesis]], initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42\u201347}}</ref> The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\"/>\n\nAlthough the earlier release of the [[Sega CD]] add-on had been commercially disappointing,<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Retroinspection: Sega 32X|last=McFerran|first=Damien|issue=77|pages=44\u201349}}</ref><ref name=\"EurogamerRAF\">{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|title=The Rise and Fall of Sega Enterprises|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|website=Eurogamer|access-date=May 1, 2014|date=February 22, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216124431/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|archive-date=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Sega began to develop a [[Improvisation|stop-gap]] solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the [[Sega Saturn]], serving as a less expensive entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]].<ref name=\"32XIGN\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=32X Follies|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 24, 2008|access-date=May 25, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417080118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] and broadly supported by Sega of America employees.  According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the [[64-bit]] [[Atari Jaguar]]. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Development===\nDuring the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1994, Sega of America [[research and development]] head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar.  Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz.  One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as \"Project Jupiter\", an entirely new independent console.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the [[Sega Genesis#Sega Virtua Processor|Sega Virtua Processor]] chip.  Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite web|author=Horowitz, Ken|title=Interview: Joe Miller|publisher=Sega-16|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|date=February 7, 2013|access-date=January 10, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233248/http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|archive-date=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, \"Oh, that's just a horrible idea.  If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on.  If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great.  But if the only thing it does is double the colors....\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions.  One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  This would come in the form of an add-on.  From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed \"Project Mars\", was advanced.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nAt the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit [[SuperH]]-2 processors.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\nAlthough the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=EGM Goes One-on-One with Sega's Chief - Tom Kalinske|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|pages=191}}</ref><ref name=\"Allgame32X\" /> Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it \"a coder's dream for the day\" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/> Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan.  Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nBefore the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America.  Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously.  Their answer was to call the 32X a \"transitional device\" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, \"[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Pre-launch promotion, release, and marketing===\n[[Image:Sega-Saturn-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Sega Saturn, released in November 1994.  The 32X was incompatible with Saturn software.]]\nThe unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago.  Promoted as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games\", 32X was marketed for its [[United States dollar|US$]]159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn.  However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software.  Founder of [[The 3DO Company]], [[Trip Hawkins]], was willing to point out that it would not, stating, \"Everyone knows that 32X is a [[Band-Aid]].  It's not a 'next generation system.'  It's fairly expensive.  It's not particularly high-performance.  It's hard to program for, and it's not compatible with the Saturn.\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>\n\nIn August of that year, ''[[GamePro]]'' highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that \"[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or [[PlayStation]] systems and games from Japan.

Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, [[Nintendo 64]], and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was \"a technological dead-end\", many developers decided not to make games for the system.<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X.  According to Bayless, \"games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way.  Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch.  By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nJournalists were similarly concerned about Sega's tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega's approach to that of [[General Motors]] and segmenting the market for its consoles.<ref name=\"FinWorld\">{{cite journal|author=Morris, Kathleen|title=Nightmare in the Fun House|journal=[[Financial World]]|date=February 21, 1995|volume=32}}</ref> In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to [[San Francisco]] for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate History of Video Games|last=Kent|first=Steven|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=495\u2013496}}</ref>\n\nThough the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared.

Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] for doing so.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, \"The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on.  An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, \"I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited.
