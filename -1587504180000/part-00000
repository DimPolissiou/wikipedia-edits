Perseus's name should properly be spelled Perseus, 'the destroyer'; and he was not, as Professor Kerenyi has suggested, an archetypal Death-figure but, probably, represented the patriarchal Hellenes who invaded Greece and Asia Minor early in the second millennium BC, and challenged the power of the Triple-goddess.

In Freud's interpretation: \"To decapitate = to castrate. The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|date=Summer 2017|title=Medusa's Head|url=|journal=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.|publisher=The Hogarth Press|volume= XVIII|pages=273}}</ref> In this perspective the \"ravishingly beautiful\" Medusa (see above) is the mother remembered in innocence; before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject. Classic Medusa, in contrast, is an Oedipal/libidinous symptom. Looking at forbidden mother (in her hair-covered genitals, so to speak) stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father's retribution. There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone.\n\n[[Archetypal literary criticism]] continues to find [[Psychoanalysts|psychoanalysis]] useful. Beth Seelig analyzes Medusa's punishment from the aspect of the crime of having been raped rather than having willingly consented in Athena's temple as an outcome of the goddess' unresolved conflicts with her own father, [[Zeus]].<ref>Seelig, B.J.

Stephen Wilk, author of ''Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon'', questioned Medusa's enduring status among the feminist movement. He believes that one reason for her longevity may be her role as a protector, fearsome and enraged. \"Only the Gorgon has the savage, threatening appearance to serve as an immediately recognized symbol of rage and a protector of women's secrets,\" wrote Wilk.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilk |first1=Stephen |title=Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=219}}</ref>\n\nEven in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage.

Furthermore, the poisonous vipers of the [[Sahara]], in the ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.1515, Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 4.770 and Lucan's'' [[Pharsalia]]'' 9.820, were said to have grown from spilt drops of her blood.

Bellerophon masters winged Pegasus and kills the Chimaera. Perseus, in a variant of the same legend, flies through the air and beheads Pegasus's mother, the Gorgon Medusa; much as Marduk, a Babylonian hero, kills the she-monster Tiamat, Goddess of the Seal. Perseus's name should properly be spelled Perseus, 'the destroyer'; and he was not, as Professor Kerenyi has suggested, an archetypal Death-figure but, probably, represented the patriarchal Hellenes who invaded Greece and Asia Minor early in the second millennium BC, and challenged the power of the Triple-goddess. Pegasus had been sacred to her because the horse with its moon-shaped hooves figured in the rain-making ceremonies and the installment of sacred kings; his wings were symbolical of a celestial nature, rather than speed.<br />Jane Harrison has pointed out (Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion) that Medusa was once the goddess herself, hiding behind a prophylactic Gorgon mask: a hideous face intended to warn the profane against trespassing on her Mysteries. Perseus beheads Medusa: that is, the Hellenes overran the goddess's chief shrines, stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks, and took possession of the sacred horses\u2014an early representation of the goddess with a Gorgon's head and a mare's body has been found in Boeotia.

In Freud's interpretation: \"To decapitate = to castrate. The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|date=Summer 2017|title=Medusa's Head|url=|journal=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.|publisher=The Hogarth Press|volume= XVIII|pages=273}}</ref> In this perspective the \"ravishingly beautiful\" Medusa (see above) is the mother remembered in innocence; before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject. Classic Medusa, in contrast, is an Oedipal/libidinous symptom. Looking at forbidden mother (in her hair-covered genitals, so to speak) stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father's retribution. There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone.\n\n[[Archetypal literary criticism]] continues to find [[Psychoanalysts|psychoanalysis]] useful. Beth Seelig analyzes Medusa's punishment from the aspect of the crime of having been raped rather than having willingly consented in Athena's temple as an outcome of the goddess' unresolved conflicts with her own father, [[Zeus]].<ref>Seelig, B.J.

Its purpose was to act as a guardian for female power, keeping the book solely in the hands of women. Stephen Wilk, author of ''Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon'', questioned Medusa's enduring status among the feminist movement. He believes that one reason for her longevity may be her role as a protector, fearsome and enraged. \"Only the Gorgon has the savage, threatening appearance to serve as an immediately recognized symbol of rage and a protector of women's secrets,\" wrote Wilk.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilk |first1=Stephen |title=Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=219}}</ref>\n\nEven in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic. Author Sibylle Baumbach described Medusa as a \u201cmultimodal image of intoxication, petrifaction, and luring attractiveness,\" citing her seductive contemporary representation, as well as her dimensionality, as the reason for her longevity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hastings |first1=Christobel |title=The Timeless Myth of Medusa, a Rape Victim Turned Into a Monster |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxwax/medusa-greek-myth-rape-victim-turned-into-a-monster |website=Broadly. |publisher=Vice |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Elizabeth Johnston's November 2016 Atlantic essay called Medusa the original 'Nasty Woman.' Johnston goes on to say that as Medusa has been repeatedly compared to Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, she proves her merit as an icon, finding relevance even in modern politics. \"Medusa has since haunted Western imagination, materializing whenever male authority feels threatened by female agency,\" writes Johnston.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnston |first1=Elizabeth |title=The Original 'Nasty Woman' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/the-original-nasty-woman-of-classical-myth/506591/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Beyond that, Medusa's story is, Johnston argues, a rape narrative. A story of victim blaming, one that she says sounds all too familiar in a current American context.\n\n{{quote|Medusa is widely known as a monstrous creature with snakes in her hair whose gaze turns men to stone. Through the lens of theology, film, art, and feminist literature, my students and I map how her meaning has shifted over time and across cultures. In so doing, we unravel a familiar narrative thread: In Western culture, strong women have historically been imagined as threats requiring male conquest and control, and Medusa herself has long been the go-to figure for those seeking to demonize female authority. |[[Elizabeth Johnston (professor)|Elizabeth Johnston]]|''[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/the-original-nasty-woman-of-classical-myth/506591/ The Original \u2018Nasty Woman\u2019]''}}\n\nThe Medusa story has also been interpreted in contemporary art as a classic case of rape-victim blaming, by the Goddess Athena.

Cixous calls writing \"an act which will not only 'realize' the decensored relation of woman to her sexuality, to her womanly being, giving her access to her native strength; it will give her back her goods, her pleasures, her organs, her immense bodily territories which have been kept under seal.\" She claims \"we must kill the false woman who is preventing the live one from breathing.

It was constructed in the years of 1766-1777 by the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Rastrelli]] as a palace for the Governor-General on the site formerly belonging to the manor of Count Davier. Since 1805 and until 1958, one of the first universities in the country, the University of Kharkov (presently [[V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University]]) had been located in it. In 1958, Ukrainian Correspondence Polytechnic Institute (UCPI) was founded in this building, in accordance with Order No. 62 of the [[Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR|Council of Ministers of Ukraine]] of 24.01.1958 and  Order of Ministry of Higher Education of Ukraine No. 78 of 21.02.1958. In 1990, UCPI was renamed into Kharkiv Engineering and Pedagogical Institute (KEPI), and in 1994 it was further renamed into Ukrainian Engineering and Pedagogical Academy (UEPA). The library's name was changed according to the changes in the name of the Academy itself. In 2010, according to the Decision of the Academic Council of the Academy and Rector's Order No. 166 of 01.06.2010, the library's name was finally changed into \"UEPA Scientific Library\".The first librarians were N.

It was constructed in the years of 1766-1777 by the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Rastrelli]] as a palace for the Governor-General on the site formerly belonging to the manor of Count Davier. Since 1805 and until 1958, one of the first universities in the country, the University of Kharkov (presently [[V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University]]) had been located in it. In 1958, Ukrainian Correspondence Polytechnic Institute (UCPI) was founded in this building, in accordance with Order No. 62 of the [[council of ministers of the ukrainian ssr|Council of Ministers of Ukraine]] of 24.01.1958 and  Order of Ministry of Higher Education of Ukraine No. 78 of 21.02.1958. In 1990, UCPI was renamed into Kharkiv Engineering and Pedagogical Institute (KEPI), and in 1994 it was further renamed into Ukrainian Engineering and Pedagogical Academy (UEPA).

Their classic line-up was [[Freddie Mercury]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Brian May]] (guitar, vocals), [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums, vocals) and [[John Deacon]] (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].\n\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the [[music video]] format.\n\nThe band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", which have become [[anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands in the world. \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], England. In 1991, he died of [[Pneumonia|bronchopneumonia]] - a complication of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the \"Queen +\" name with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] and [[Adam Lambert]].\n\nEstimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. In 1990, Queen received the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the [[British Phonographic Industry]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles, and all four were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2005, Queen received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2018, they were presented the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1968\u20131974: Early era===\n[[File:Queen First Public Performance Here 18 July 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PRS for Music]] heritage award commemorating Queen's first performance, [[Prince Consort Road]], London]]\nIn 1968, guitarist Brian May, a student at London's [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], and bassist [[Tim Staffell]] decided to form a band.

Their classic line-up was [[Freddie Mercury]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Brian May]] (guitar, vocals), [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums, vocals) and [[John Deacon]] (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].\n\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the [[music video]] format.\n\nThe band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", which have become [[anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands in the world. \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], England. In 1991, he died of [[Pneumonia|bronchopneumonia]] - a complication of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the \"Queen +\" name with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] and [[Adam Lambert]].\n\nEstimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. In 1990, Queen received the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the [[British Phonographic Industry]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles, and all four were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2005, Queen received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2018, they were presented the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1968\u20131974: Early era===\n[[File:Queen First Public Performance Here 18 July 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PRS for Music]] heritage award commemorating Queen's first performance, [[Prince Consort Road]], London]]\nIn 1968, guitarist Brian May, a student at London's [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], and bassist [[Tim Staffell]] decided to form a band.
