Its splendor was between the 12th to 14th centuries, in which two important [[Torah]] centers flourished in [[Barcelona]] and [[Girona]]. The Catalan Jewish community developed unique characteristics, which included customs, a prayer rite ([[Nusach Catalonia|''Nusach'' Catalonia]]),<ref>According to ''Rabbi Yitzhaq Luria Ashkenazi (Arizal)'', ''nusach'' Catalonia is one of the 12 existing ''nusachim'' that correspond to the 12 tribes of Israel (''Rabbi Chayim Vital'', ''Sefer Shaar ha-Kavanot, nusach ha-tefillah'', the secret of the 12 doors). Regarding the different traditions and customs, the ''Arizal'' divides the people of Israel into four major families: Sepharad, Ashkenaz, Catalonia and Italy (''Sheneh Luchot ha-Berit, Torah she-bikhtav, Bemidbar'').</ref> and a tradition of its own in issuing legal decisions (''[[Halakha]]h'').<ref>Rabbi ''Shimon ben Tzemach Duran (Rashbatz)'' mentions on several occasions that in Catalonia tradition was ruled according to the opinions of Rabbi ''Shelomoh ben Adret (Rashba)'' while in Sepharad was ruled according to the opinions of Rabbi ''Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh)'', ''Rabbi Yaaqov ben Asher'' ''(Baal ha-Turim)'' and Rabbi ''Moshe ben Maymon (Rambam)'': \u00abIn Catalonia the halachic decisions are followed according to ''Rashba'', while in Sepharad are followed according to ''Baal ha-Turim and Rambam''\u00bb (reference: ''Tashbetz'', vol 3, 257, see also: ''Tashbetz'' vol 2, 141, vol 3, 86, vol 3, 118, vol 4, column 3, 10).</ref> Although the Jews of Catalonia had a ritual of prayer<ref>Recently, has been published the ''[https://sidurcatalunya.com/ Sidur Catalunya]'', which constitutes the first reconstruction of the old ''nusach'' Catalonia.

During the Visigoth period, numerous decrees were issued against the Jews and sometimes they were forced to convert to Christianity or be expelled.\n\nIn 711 CE, Muslims began conquering the Iberian Peninsula. The conquered areas that were under the rule of Islam were called ''[[al-Andalus]]'' (in Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633). We do not know much about the history of the Jews at the beginning of Islamic rule, but we are aware that the Jews began to use the term Sepharad<ref>The name Sepharad appears for the first time in the book of Obadiah 1:20: \u00abAnd this exiled host of the children of Israel who are [with] the Canaanites as far as Zarephath and the exile of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad shall inherit the cities of the southland\u00bb. Rashi was based on the Targum Yonathan, which translated the name Sepharad by the term Aspamia: \u00abSepharad, translated Yonathan: Aspamia\u00bb.</ref> to refer to these lands.<ref>From the letter of Rabbi ''Chasday ibn Shaprut'' to the King of the ''Kuzarim'', we can deduce that the name Sepharad referred to the lands that were under the rule of Islam, that is, ''al-Andalus'': \u00abKnow your majesty the King, that the name of our land in which we live, in the sacred language is Sepharad and in the language of the Ishmaelites (Arabs) that inhabit it is ''al-Andalus'', and the name of its capital is Cordoba\u00bb. The letter was written by Rabbi ''Yehudah ha-Levi'', and therefore, the sentence only reflects the time of the author.</ref>\n\nIn a process of territorial reoccupation called [[Reconquista]], the Christian kingdoms progressively conquered all Islamic territories, from north to south. With the Christian Reconquista, the territories occupied by the kingdoms of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Portugal]] were also called by the Jews Sepharad, while Catalonia and the other kingdoms of the north were called ''Edom'' or named after ''Esau''.<ref>So, Rabbi ''Moshe ben Maymon'' (Maimonides) writes in his book ''Mishneh Torah'': \u00abSynagogues and study houses must be treated with respect and must be sprinkled (cleaned up). In Sepharad and in the West (Morocco), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to light the candles in the synagogues and extend the blinds on the floor on which the parishioners sit. In the lands of ''Edom'' (Christian lands) in the synagogues people sit on chairs [or benches]\u00bb. (''Hilkhot Tefillah'', 11, 5).</ref>\n\nThe reconquest of Catalonia began under the auspices of the Frankish kings, who forced the Muslims who had managed to cross the Pyrenees at the [[Battle of Poitiers (732)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732 to retreat to the south. All the lands freed from the Islamic domain became counties and remained under the administrative organization of the [[Franks]]. The Catalan counties, led by the counts of Barcelona, slowly broke free from the Franks and began to govern themselves independently. [[Old Catalonia]] became a zone of containment ([[Marca Hispanica]]) against the spread of [[Islam]]. Jews often moved from Sepharad (the Muslim zone) to the northern lands (the Christian kingdoms), and vice versa. The fact that many of them spoke Arabic and also the vernacular Romance languages helped them to serve as translators and acquire important positions in both Muslim and Christian governments. Jews owned fields and vineyards and many of them devoted themselves to agriculture.\n\nIn this early period, the Jewish scholars of Catalonia who sought advanced Talmudic studies used to go to study in the Talmudic academies (''yeshivot'') in the South. Also, those who wanted to study science or linguistics went to Sepharad, as did Rabbi ''[[Menahem ben Saruq|Menachem ben Saruq]]'' (920-970), who was born in the Catalan city of Tortosa and moved with all his family to Cordoba to study and to devote himself to the Hebrew language under the patronage of Governor ''[[Samuel ibn Naghrillah|Shemuel ibn Nagrella]]''.\n\nThe first evidence of an important Jewish settlement in Barcelona and Girona are from the 9th century CE. We know that in the 11th and 12th centuries in Barcelona there was a rabbinical court ''([[Beth din|Bet Din]])'' and an important teaching center of the Torah. In this period, Barcelona became a link in the chain of transmission of the teachings of the ''Geonim''<ref>The period of the ''Gueonim'' dates from the end of the 6th century to the middle of the 11th century.</ref>''.''\n\nImportant Catalonian Rabbis \u00a0from this time are Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Reuben Albargeloni|Yitzchaq ben Reuven al-Bargeloni]]'' (1043 -?), Rabbi ''[[Judah ben Barzillai|Yehudah ben Barzilay ha-Barceloni]]'', called ''Yehudah ha-Nasi'' of Barcelona (late 11th century, beginning of the 12th century) and Rabbi ''[[Abraham bar Hiyya|Avraham bar Chiyya Nasi]]''<ref>Barcelona was well-known like the city of the ''nesiim'' (patriarchs), due to the great amount of personalities that enjoyed this honorific title.</ref> (late 11th century, first half of the 12th century). We know that two of the great ''chachamim'' of Provence, Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Abba Mari|Yitzchaq ben Abba Mari]]'' (1122-1193) and Rabbi [[Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne|''Avraham ben'' Rabbi ''Yitzchaq'']] (1110-1179), moved to Barcelona.\n\nCatalonia joined [[Provence]] in 1112 and [[Aragon]] in 1137, and thus Barcelona became the capital of the unified kingdom called the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The kings of the Crown of Aragon extended their domains to the [[Occitania|Occitan]] countries.\n\n== 12th and 13th centuries ==\n\n[[File:\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\"\u05df.jpg|thumb|Seal attributed to Nachmanides [Copy from the Museum of History of the Jews in Girona]]]\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries the Catalonian Talmudic academies thrived. The great Rabbis and kabbalists ''[[Ezra ben Shelomoh|Ezra]]'' and ''[[Azriel of Gerona|Azriel bene Shelomoh]]'' (late 12th century, beginning of the 13th century) disciples of the famous Rabbi ''[[Isaac the Blind|Yitzchaq el Cec]]'' (the Blind) (1160-1235), son of Rabbi ''[[Abraham ben David|Avraham ben David]]'' ''(Raabad)'' of Posqui\u00e8res (1120-1198), stood out in the city of Girona. We can also include Rabbi ''[[Yaaqov ben Sheshet]]'' (12th century) among the Girona kabbalists of this period. Also, from Girona was Rabbi [[Avraham ben Yitzchaq he-Hazan|''Avraham ben'' ''Yitzchaq'' ''he-Hazan'']] (12th-13th centuries) author of the ''piyyut''<ref>Liturgical poem.</ref> ''Achot qetanah'' (little sister). From the city of Girona was the greatest of Catalonian sages, Rabbi ''[[Nachmanides|Moshe ben Nachman]]'' (''Ramban'', or Nachmanides) (1194-1270), whose Catalonian name was ''Bonastruc \u00e7a Porta''.\n\nAlthough the city of Girona was an important center of Torah that had a Bet Midrash (House of Study) dedicated to the study of the [[Kabbalah]], the main city was Barcelona, where the ''Ramban'' served as the head of the community. During this period, Rabbi ''[[Yonah Gerondi|Yona Girondi]]'' (1210-1263) and his famous disciples Rabbi ''[[Aharon HaLevi|Aharon ben Yosef ha-Levi]]'' of Barcelona ''(Reah)'' (1235-1303) and Rabbi ''[[Shlomo ibn Aderet|Shelomoh ben Adret]] (Rashba)'' (1235-1310). Also, Rabbi ''[[Asher ben Jehiel|Asher ben Yechiel]] (Rosh)'' (1250-1327), his son Rabbi ''[[Jacob ben Asher|Yaaqov ben Asher]] (Baal ha-Turim)'' (1269-1343), and Rabbi ''[[Yom Tov Asevilli|Yom Tov ben Avraham ha-Sevilli]] (Ritba)'' 1250-1330), disciples of ''Rashba'' and ''Reah''. We can say that at that time Barcelona became the most important Talmudic study center in all of the European Jewry. \n[[File:\u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 \u05e8 \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9.jpg|thumb|''Heqdesh rabbi Shemuel ha-Sardi'' in the Old City of Barcelona.|alt=]]\nIn Catalonia in the 13th century Jews were victims of [[blood libel]]s and were forced to wear a distinctive sign called ''Rodella''. The authorities prohibited Jews from performing public office and were forced to participate in public disputes with representatives of Christianity, such as the [[Disputation of Barcelona|Barcelona Disputation]] of 1263 in which the ''Ramban'' participate as a representative of [[Judaism]]. The Jews were private property of the monarchy who charged them taxes in exchange for protection. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ''\u00a0''\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe kings of the Crown of Aragon expanded the Catalan domains and conquered Mallorca, Valencia, Ibiza and Menorca. In 1258 they signed the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Corbeil treaty]] with the French king for which they renounced to their rights over the Occitan lands. In return, the Franks resigned their demands on the Catalan lands.\n\n== 14th century ==\n[[File:Girona - Museu d'Hist\u00f2ria dels Jueus - 20110123 (4).jpg|thumb|Stone commemorating the inauguration of a synagogue in Girona (14th century).]]\nIn the 14th century Christian fanaticism prevailed throughout the Iberian Peninsula and there were many persecutions against the Jews. We can mention among Catalonian sages of this period Rabbi ''[[Peretz Gerondi|Peretz ben Yitzchaq ha-Kohen]]'' (1304-1370) who was born in Provence but dwelled in Barcelona, Rabbi ''[[Nissim of Gerona|Nisim ben Reuven Girondi]] (Ran)'' (1315-1376) who served as a Rabbi in Barcelona, Rabbi ''[[Chasday ben Yehudah Cresques]]'' (the elder), Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Sheshet|Yitzchaq bar Sheshet Perfet]] (Ribash)'' (1326-1408), Rabbi ''[[Hasdai Crescas|Chasday Cresques]] (Rachaq)'' (1340-1412), Rabbi ''[[Profiat Duran|Yitzchaq ben Moshe ha-Levi]]'' (''Profiat Duran, ha-Ephody'') (1350-1415), Rabbi ''[[Simeon ben Zemah Duran|Shimon ben Tzemach Duran]] (Rashbatz)'' (1361-1444). From this same period, we can include the cartographer of Mallorca ''[[Abraham Cresques|Avraham Cresques]]'' (14th century) and the poet ''[[Shelomoh ben Meshullam de Piera]]'' (1310/50-1420/25).\n\nRabbi ''Nisim ben Reuven Girondi (Ran)'' resumed the activity of the Barcelona Yeshivah in the 50s and 60s, after the Jewish community was heavily affected by the [[Black Death]] in 1348. In 1370, Jews of Barcelona were victims of attacks instigated by a blood libel; a few Jews were assassinated and the secretaries of the community were imprisoned in the [[synagogue]] for a few days without food.\n[[File:\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea.jpg|thumb|Seal for the ''Matsot'' (acetic breads) (14th century) [Copy from the History Museum of the Jews in Girona].]]\nThe end of the century brought the revolts of 1391. As a result of the riots, many Jews were forced to convert to Christianity and many others died as martyrs. Others succeeded in fleeing to North Africa (such as ''Ribash'' and ''Rashbatz''), Italy and the Ottoman Empire. It was the end of the Jewish communities of Valencia and Barcelona. The community of Mallorca held out until 1435, when Jews were forced to convert to Christianity; the community of Girona barely endured until the expulsion of 1492.\n\nRabbi ''Chasday Cresques'', in a letter he sent to the Jewish community of [[Avignon]], offers us an account about the riots of 1391.<ref>The letter was published in the book ''Shevet Yehudah'', Rabbi ''Yehudah ibn Verga'' (edition of Hanover, 1924).</ref> In summary, we can conclude from his account that the riots began on the first day of the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew month]] of ''[[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]]'' (Sunday, 4/6/1391) in [[Seville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and close to seventy other locations. From day seven of the month of ''[[Av]]'' (Sunday, 9/7/1391), they extended to other communities of the Crown of Aragon: [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Lleida]], [[Girona]] and [[Mallorca]]. During the 1391 attacks, the majority of the Jewish communities of Sepharad, Catalonia and Aragon were destroyed.\n\nDuring the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the kings of the Crown of Aragon expanded their territories to the lands of the Mediterranean; they conquered [[Sicily]] (1282), [[Corsica]] (1297-1516), [[Athens]] (1311), [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatria]] (1318), [[Sardinia]] (1323-1326) and [[Naples]] (1435-1442).\n\n== 15th century ==\nThe fifteenth century was very hard for Jewish life in the Iberian Peninsula. The communities that survived the 1391 riots faced great pressure on the part of the church and the Christian population. The kings, who were in a difficult economic situation, imposed heavy taxes on Jewish communities. The lives of the \u201cConverso\u201d Jews who converted to Christianity was not easy either, the church called them \u201c[[new Christian]]s\u201d and they always kept them under suspicion, since many of them accepted Christianity only as an outward pretense but actually maintained Judaism in secret. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] persecuted and punished the new Christians who observed the commandments of Judaism.\n\nCatalonia hosted one of the longest disputes in the Middle Ages, the famous [[Disputation of Tortosa|Dispute of Tortosa]] (1413-1414). In the 15th century, we find the poet ''[[Solomon ben Reuben Bonfed|Shelomoh ben Reuven Bonafed]]'' in Catalonia.\n\nIn 1469 King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando of Aragon]] (1452-1516) and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel of Castile]] (1451-1504) married and unified the two kingdoms. In 1492 they completed the reconquest with the defeat of the [[Emirate of Granada|Kingdom of Granada]] and expelled Jews from all of their kingdoms.\n\n== The diaspora of the Jews of Catalonia ==\nThe first group of exiled Jews of Catalonia came out in the wake of the 1391 attacks, they went mainly to Italy ([[Sicily]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Livorno]]), North Africa ([[Algeria]]) and the Ottoman Empire (mainly [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]], [[Constantinople]] and the [[Land of Israel]]). The second group came into exile following the expulsion of the Catholic kings. The Edict was decreed on March 31, 1492, and time was given to Jews to sell their properties and leave until July 31, which, according to the Hebrew calendar, fell that year on the eve of the eight of the month ''Av'', which means that the Jews were traveling on the ships expelled on [[Tisha B'Av|9th of ''Av'']]. A large number of Jews converted to Christianity in order to remain in Catalonia.\n\n=== Settlement in Italy ===\nMany of the Catalonian Jews arrived in Italy and found refuge in Sicily, Naples, Livorno and the city of Rome.\n\n==== Sicily ====\n[[File:Aron di Agira.jpg|thumb|''Aron ha-Qodesh'' (Torah Scrolls Ark) of the Catalonian Jewish community of Agira, Sicily (1453).]]\nWe know that Jews from the Iberian Peninsula settled in Sicily since the 11th century.<ref>In some manuscripts preserved in the Cairo Genizah, we find Jews called the 'Sephardic' or the 'Andalusi'. See: Menahem ben Sassoon, ''Yehude Sicilia, teudot u-meqorot'', Jerusalem: 1991 (in Hebrew).</ref> The famous Kabbalist Rabbi ''[[Abraham Abulafia|Avraham Abulafia]]'' (1240-1291), who studied many years in Catalonia, settled in Sicily, where he wrote most of his works.<ref>Moshe Idel, \u00abThe Ecstatic Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia in Sicily and its Transmission during the Renaissance\u00bb, ''Italia Judaica V: Atti del V Convegno internazionale (Palermo, 15-19 giugno 1992)'', Roma: Ministerio per i benni culturali e ambientali, pp. 330-340.</ref> Sicily had been part of the Catalan-Aragonese crown for many years and the Jewish communities remained on the island until the end of the 15th century, with the expulsion edict of the Jews of the island on June 18, 1492. We know of the existence of a Catalan Jewish community in the island thanks to the identification of a manuscript<ref>In ''Sidur Catalunya'', the manuscript Parma Palatina 1750 is identified as ''nusach'' Catalonia. Before the reading of the Torah of Shabbat there appears the \"blessing of the king\" in which King Don Fadrique of Aragon is mentioned, surely it is King Fadrique III (1341-1377) who reigned in Sicily during 1355-1377. This manuscript represents the first document that refers to the Catalan Jewish community of Sicily, which as we can see already existed before the 1391 revolts.</ref> of the 14th century as ''siddur'' ''nusach'' Catalonia.<ref>Until today, it was supposed that the migratory wave of Catalan Jews in Sicily began as a result of the 1391 revolts. See: Nadia Zeldes, \u00abEls jueus i conversos catalans a Sic\u00edlia: migraci\u00f3, relacions culturals i conflicte social\u00bb, Roser Salicr\u00fa i Lluch et. al.

In un armadio di pietra la loro storia\u00bb, ''La Stampa'' (13 setembre 2017).</ref> It was found in the church of Sancta Sanctorum Salvatore and commemorates the construction of the synagogue of the Catalan Jews in 1453, it is one of the oldest ''Aron ha-Qodesh'' in Europe.\n\n==== Rome ====\n[[File:\u05e7\u05d8\u05dc\u05d0\u05df \u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0.jpg|thumb|Band of the Catalan-Aragonese Synagogue of Rome (1838).]]\nCatalonian Jews were also exiled to the city of Rome. In 1517 the Catalonian Jewish community of Rome was well organized and built a synagogue following the ''minhag''<ref>Tradition, custom.</ref> Catalonia (''Schola hebreorum Nationis Catalanorum'').<ref>The archive documents were published in: Ariel Toaff, \u00abThe jewish communities of Catalonia, Aragon and Castile in 16th century Rome\u00bb, Ariel Toaff, Simon Schwarzfuchs (eds.), ''The Mediterranean and the Jews. Banking, Finance and International Trade (XVI-XVIII centuries)'', Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1989, pp. 259-270.</ref> In 1519 Pope [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1475-1521) granted them a permit to widen the community and move the synagogue to a new location, allowed them to remodel and adapt it into a house of prayer according to their rites and customs. By the end of 1527, the Catalonian community and the Aragonese community decided to merge. The joint synagogue of Catalonia and Aragon changed its location again in 1549. In 1555, the community approved the expenses for the construction of another synagogue. The Catalan-Aragonese community fought to avoid merging with the Sephardic communities. All other communities from the Iberian Peninsula merged into a single united Iberian community in Rome, except for the Catalonians who joined the Aragonese. With the establishment of the [[ghetto]] in 1555, the Catalonian community maintained its own separate synagogue. In a census of 1868, it can be observed that of the total of 4995 Jews in Rome, 838 belonged to the community of Catalonia. In 1904 the Catalan synagogue ended up joining the other synagogues of Rome to form a single synagogue that was constructed on the banks of the [[Tiber]] River. Since then we have no information about the Catalonian community.\n\n=== Settlement in the Ottoman Empire ===\nThe exiled Jews of Catalonia also migrated to the Ottoman Empire where they were organized in communities according to the place of origin that were called ''Qehalim''.<ref>They were organized in seven ''Qehalim'' called: Catalan, Aragon, Castilla, Lisbon, Guerush Sepharad, Mallorca and Sicily.</ref> There were Catalonian ''Qehalim'' in [[Istanbul]], [[Edirne]], [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]] and [[Safed]], among others.<ref>The censuses were published in: Simon Schwarzfuchs, \u00abLa Catalogne et l'invention de Sepharad\u00bb, ''Actes del I Congr\u00e9s per a l'estudi dels jueus en territori de llengua catalana: Barcelona-Girona, del 15 al 17 d'octubre de 2001'', Barcelona: Publicacions i Edicions de la Universitat de Barcelona, 2004, pp. 185-208.</ref>\n\n==== The Catalonian Jewish Community of Salonica ====\nThe Jews of Catalonia formed a [[History of the Jews in Thessaloniki|community in Salonica]] that was called \u201cCatalan\u201d.<ref>The cemetery of the Jewish community of Salonica was established in the 16th century and was destroyed in 1943. Nowadays, the University of Salonica is in the same place. Although the tombstones were destroyed some local researchers transcribed the inscriptions, so the text of the funeral tombstones of the Catalan community has been preserved.</ref> Despite being a minority, the Catalonian Jews fought to avoid merging with the Sephardic communities and maintained their ancient customs. The religious leaders of the holy communities of Catalonia in Salonica received the title of ''Marbitz Torah''<ref>Torah teacher, religious community leader.</ref> and not the title Rabbi. The first known was ''[[Eliezer ha-Shimoni]]'', who arrived in Salonica in 1492. He had a great influence on all the communities of Salonica and was one of the first to sign the agreements ''(Haskamot)'' of the sages. Later we find ''[[Moshe Capsali]]''. The ''chacham'' ''[[Yehudah ben Benveniste]]'', also arrived after the expulsion and established a very important library.

In the second volume ''\"Tefillat Yaaqov\"'', there is a long historical introduction about the Jewish community of Catalonia and the edition of the ''machzor'' written in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Judeo-Spanish]];<ref>The Sephardic community (Castile) became the largest and most influential in Salonica, which was how the Judeo-Spanish language (also called ''Ladino, Judezmo, Spa\u00f1olit'', etc.) became the lingua franca of all Jewish communities (including those of Catalonia, France and Ashkenaz).</ref> the same summary introduction is found in the first volume ''\"Tefillat Shemuel \"'', written in Hebrew. Below is a fragment of the translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version:\n\n\u00abOne of the most precious pearls that our ancestors brought from the exile of Catalonia, when they had to leave as exiles, was the old order of the prayers of ''Rosh ha-Shana'' and ''Yom Kippur'', known as ''the 'nusach Barcelona, minhag Catalunya'''.\n\nAnd because of the misfortunes and tumult of the exile, that arrived of fatal form on the poor wandering refugees, the majority of the customs were confused, and slowly, almost all were fused in the same order of prayers called ''<nowiki/>'nusach Sepharad''', almost all, except some exceptional communities that did not change their customs.\n\nThe members of the Holy community Catalonia in our city of Salonica did not change their custom, and until today they maintain the tradition of their ancestors and offer their prayers to God on Days of Awe following the ancient ''nusach'' that they brought from Catalonia.\n\nThe Jews of Catalonia were the most prominent among their brothers in the rest of the Sepharad countries and their wisdom and science were superior. The distinguished communities of Barcelona always took pride in the fact that great Rabbis and personalities from their community illuminated the eyes of the whole Jewish diaspora. There was a saying that Sephardic Jews used to say: the air of Barcelona, it makes you wise. \u00bb \u00a0\n\nThe Catalonian Jewish community of Salonica was totally annihilated in the Holocaust. The few survivors emigrated to [[Israel]] after the war between the years 1945 and 1947.\n\n=== Settlement in North Africa (Algeria) ===\nThe coasts of Catalonia, Valencia and Mallorca are in front of the coast of Algeria. These lands long maintained commercial relations; also, the Jewish communities maintained close ties. After the riots of 1391, a large group of Catalonian Jews fled to the coasts of Algeria. We know that most of the Jews of Barcelona fled and settled in the city of Algiers. At that time, three kingdoms were established in North Africa after the fall of the Almohad, one in the area of present-day [[Morocco]], another in [[Tunisia]] and a third in [[Algeria]], which was ruled by the dynasty of ''Beni-Ziyan'' from the ancient capital of [[Tlemcen]]. In general, the Jews of Castile went to Morocco, while the Jews of Catalonia, Valencia, Mallorca and Aragon went to Algeria and Tunisia.\n\n==== The Jews of Algiers ====\n[[File:56A346.jpg|thumb|''Machzor Qatan'', according to the custom of the Holy communities of Algiers, Livorno, 1886.<ref>National Library of Israel R 56 A 346.</ref>]]\n\nThe Muslim rulers of Algeria received the Jewish exiles with open arms. As soon as the Christian authorities saw that Jews and converts fled to Algeria, they forbade them from leaving the country, increased their persecution and flight became more difficult. The Jews who settled in Algeria received the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s,'' as is usual in Islamic countries in exchange for paying taxes. The situation of Jews in Algeria before the arrival of the exiles was very poor, both their economic situation and the level of Torah studies. Peninsular refugees contributed to raising the country's economy thanks to commercial activities with European lands and also improved the level of Torah studies.\n\nTwo of the great later ''Rishonim'', Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Sheshet|Yitzhaq bar Sheshet Perfet]] (Ribash)''<ref>The ''Ribash'' was for many years the great Rabbi of Catalonia.</ref> and Rabbi ''[[Simeon ben Zemah Duran|Shimon ben Tzemac\u1e25 Duran]] (Rashbatz)''<ref>The ''Rashbatz'', had been dedicated in Mallorca to the medical profession. Once in Algeria, where there was not so much demand for this profession, he was forced to earn a living as a rabbi. (''Maguen Avot'', chap. 4, 45).</ref> fled to Algeria. ''Ribash'' had long been the grand Rabbi of Catalonia, and ''Rashbatz'', despite his great preparation and knowledge of the Torah, had been dedicated to the medical profession. After a while, ''Ribash'' was named ''Mara de-Atra'' (maximum rabbinical authority) and head of the Rabbinic Court of the Algiers community, and ''Rashbatz'' was appointed ''Dayan'' (judge) to his court. When ''Ribash'' died, ''Rashbatz'' occupied his place. The Jews of Algeria accepted the authority of these two great Rabbis, who were followed by the descendants of ''Rashbatz'', his son Rabbi ''[[Shelomo ben Shimon]] (Rashbash)'' and his disciples. Throughout the generations, the Jews of Algeria have faithfully and meticulously maintained the spiritual legacy and customs that came from Catalonia. Until today, ''Ribash'', ''Rashbatz'' and ''Rashbash'' are considered the main Rabbis of Algiers.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the manner of dictating ''halakhah'' by the Rabbis of Algiers throughout generations has been respect for customs and traditions; the established custom has always trumped ''halakha'', and this is a characteristic that was inherited from ''Bet Midrash'' of the ''Ramban''. Matters of ''halakha'' in Algiers have always been dictated following the school of ''Ribash, Rashbatz'' and ''Rashbash'', and not according to the opinions of ''Maran ha-Bet Yosef'' (''[[Joseph Karo|Yosef Caro]]'', and his work the ''[[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan Arukh]]'').<ref>For example, Rabbi ''Refael Yedidya Shelomo Tzror'' (1682-1729), author of the work ''<nowiki/>'Pri Tzadiq''', wrote in his introduction to the ''Taixbetz'' book: \u00abIn Algiers the local custom is followed, and legal decisions are not issued according to the ''Bet Yosef'' \u00bb.</ref> In fact, the Jews of Algiers followed the ''halakhic'' dictation inherited from the Catalan ''Bet Midrash'' of the ''Ramban'' and the ''Rashba''. Thus, for example, Rabbi ''Avraham ibn Taua'' (1510-1580),<ref>Rabbi ''Avraham ibn Taua'' was a descendant of the ''Rashabtz'', and at the same time of the ''Ramban'', and served as the head of the Algerian ''Yeshivah''. His ''Responsa'' were compiled in two books, one of which was published in the third part of the book ''<nowiki/>'Chut ha-meshulash''', and that the printers added to the fourth volume of the ''<nowiki/>'Tashbetz' Responsa'' book.</ref> grandson of ''Rashbatz'', responded to a question asked by the Rabbis of Fez on a matter referring to the laws of ''[[Shabbat]]'':<ref>''Tashbetz'', vol. 4 (''<nowiki/>'Chut ha-meshulash'''), 3, 10.</ref>\n\n\u00abAnswer: Dear Rabbis, God guard you; know that we are [descendants of] the expelled from the land of Catalonia, and according to what our parents of blessed memory used in those lands, we also used in these places where we have dispersed because of our sins. You know that the Rabbis of Catalonia, according to the dictates on which all the customs of our community are based, are ''Ramban'', ''Rashba'', ''Reah'' and ''Ran'', of blessed memory, and other great Rabbis who accompanied them in their generation, although their opinions were not published. Therefore, you do not have to question the customs of our community, since as long as you cannot find any of the issues explicitly mentioned in the books, it should be assumed that they followed the custom according to these great Rabbis. \u00bb\n\nAlso, regarding the order of prayers and ''piyyutim'', the Jews of Algiers were strictly conservative with the customs that came from Catalonia. ''Machzor minhag'' Algiers, for example, arrived from Catalonia around 1391.<ref>Rabbi ''Yitzchaq Morali'' (1867-1952), in his introduction to ''machzor minhag'' Alger, writes: \"This machzor was brought by our Sepharad parents when they fled from the ravages of 1391, and our Rabbis ''Ribash'' and ''Rashbatz'', of holy and blessed memory, kept it. And thus, accustomed the later generations\u00bb.</ref>\n[[File:\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05e5.jpg|thumb|''Chokhmat Misken: ve-hu sefer Qrovats'', Livorno, 1772.<ref>[https://rosetta.nli.org.il/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE84117009 National Library of Israel R 23 V 2883].</ref>]]\nIn the eighteenth century, scholars questioned some of the ancient customs saying that they contradicted the dictates of Rabbi ''[[Isaac Luria|Yitzchaq Luria Ashkenazi]] (Arizal)'' (1534-1572). The old custom that came from Catalonia consisted of reciting ''piyyutim'' (and also prayers and supplications) in the middle of prayer. They argued that the custom of the city had to be changed. So, they began to change the ''nusach'' of the prayers that had been in force in Algiers since ancient times. The Algerian Rabbis \u00a0opposed this development, arguing that the old custom could not be changed,<ref>See: Shelomo Ouaknin, \u00abTeshuvot chakhme Algir ve-Tunis be-inyan shinui be-minhag ha-tefillah be-Algir\u00bb, ''Mekabtziel'' 39, pp. 33-102 (in Hebrew).</ref> but in the following generations, most synagogues in the city of Algiers did change the rite of prayer and adopted the custom of the ''Arizal'' (known as the custom of the Kabbalists, ''minhag ha-mequbalim'').<ref>''Minhag ha-mequbalim'' was established around 1765.</ref> Only two synagogues maintained the ancient custom (known as the custom of literalists, ''minhag ha-pashtamim''): The Great Synagogue and the synagogue ''Yakhin u-Boaz'' (later renamed Guggenheim Society).\n\nThe ''piyyutim'' mentioned above, which are recited on special ''Shabbatot'' and festivals, etc., were edited in a book called ''Qrovatz''.<ref>Nehoray ben Seadya Azoviv, ''<nowiki/>'Chokhmat Misk\u00e9n: ve-hu sefer Qrovatz she-nahagu leomram ha-qahal ha-qadosh she-be-ir Argel''', Livorno 1772.</ref> The Jews from Algiers have maintained the texts and melodies that arrived in Algiers during the period of the ''Ribash'' and the ''Rashbatz'' until the present day. According to the tradition, these are the original melodies that arrived from Catalonia with the two great Rabbis.<ref>In the synagogues where ''minhag ha-mequbalim'' was imposed, they also maintained the melodies and ''nusach'' of ''piyyutim'', although they were told outside the ''tefillah (amidah)'' and the blessings of the ''Shema'' reading, as is nowadays accustomed to the ''minhag'' of the Sephardim.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the annual Ethnomusicology Workshop was held,<ref>The workshop was organized by the faculty of music of the University of Bar-Illan with the collaboration of the phonotheque of the National Library of Israel and the Jewish Music Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</ref> which focused on the customs and liturgical tradition of the Jews of Algeria.<ref>Edwin Seroussi & Eric Karsenti, \u00abThe Study of Liturgical Music of Algerian Jewry\u00bb. ''Pe\u2019amim'' 91 (2002), pp. 31-50.</ref> Algerian cantors from France and Israel attended. The workshop was recorded and today the recordings can be listened to on the website of the National Library of Israel. The liturgy of ''Shabbat, Rosh Chodesh, Yamim Noraim'', festivals, fasts and ''piyyutim'' for various celebrations were recorded. Although more than 600 years have elapsed, and there have been certain alterations, we can affirm that the uniqueness of the liturgical tradition of the Jews of Algiers largely preserves the medieval tradition of liturgical songs of the Jews of Catalonia.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Yitzhak Baer, ''A history of the Jews in Christian Spain'', Philadelphia : Jewish Publication Society of America, 1961\u20131966.\n* Jean R\u00e9gn\u00e9, ''History of the Jews in Aragon: regesta and documents, 1213-1327'' Jerusalem: 1978.\n* Yom Tov Assis, ''The Golden Age of Aragonese Jewry.

Regarding the different traditions and customs, the ''Arizal'' divides the people of Israel into four major families: Sepharad, Ashkenaz, Catalonia and Italy (''Sheneh Luchot ha-Berit, Torah she-bikhtav, Bemidbar'').</ref> and a tradition of its own in issuing legal decisions (''[[Halakha]]h'').<ref>Rabbi ''Shimon ben Tzemach Duran (Rashbatz)'' mentions on several occasions that in Catalonia tradition was ruled according to the opinions of Rabbi ''Shelomoh ben Adret (Rashba)'' while in Sepharad was ruled according to the opinions of Rabbi ''Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh)'', ''Rabbi Yaaqov ben Asher'' ''(Baal ha-Turim)'' and Rabbi ''Moshe ben Maymon (Rambam)'': \u00abIn Catalonia the halachic decisions are followed according to ''Rashba'', while in Sepharad are followed according to ''Baal ha-Turim and Rambam''\u00bb (reference: ''Tashbetz'', vol 3, 257, see also: ''Tashbetz'' vol 2, 141, vol 3, 86, vol 3, 118, vol 4, column 3, 10).</ref> Although the Jews of Catalonia had a ritual of prayer<ref>Recently, has been published the ''[https://sidurcatalunya.com/ Sidur Catalunya]'', which constitutes the first reconstruction of the old ''nusach'' Catalonia.

During the Visigoth period, numerous decrees were issued against the Jews and sometimes they were forced to convert to Christianity or be expelled.\n\nIn 711 CE, Muslims began conquering the Iberian Peninsula. The conquered areas that were under the rule of Islam were called ''[[al-Andalus]]'' (in Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633). We do not know much about the history of the Jews at the beginning of Islamic rule, but we are aware that the Jews began to use the term Sepharad<ref>The name Sepharad appears for the first time in the book of Obadiah 1:20: \u00abAnd this exiled host of the children of Israel who are [with] the Canaanites as far as Zarephath and the exile of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad shall inherit the cities of the southland\u00bb. Rashi was based on the Targum Yonathan, which translated the name Sepharad by the term Aspamia: \u00abSepharad, translated Yonathan: Aspamia\u00bb.</ref> to refer to these lands.<ref>From the letter of Rabbi ''Chasday ibn Shaprut'' to the King of the ''Kuzarim'', we can deduce that the name Sepharad referred to the lands that were under the rule of Islam, that is, ''al-Andalus'': \u00abKnow your majesty the King, that the name of our land in which we live, in the sacred language is Sepharad and in the language of the Ishmaelites (Arabs) that inhabit it is ''al-Andalus'', and the name of its capital is Cordoba\u00bb. The letter was written by Rabbi ''Yehudah ha-Levi'', and therefore, the sentence only reflects the time of the author.</ref>\n\nIn a process of territorial reoccupation called [[Reconquista]], the Christian kingdoms progressively conquered all Islamic territories, from north to south. With the Christian Reconquista, the territories occupied by the kingdoms of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Portugal]] were also called by the Jews Sepharad, while Catalonia and the other kingdoms of the north were called ''Edom'' or named after ''Esau''.<ref>So, Rabbi ''Moshe ben Maymon'' (Maimonides) writes in his book ''Mishneh Torah'': \u00abSynagogues and study houses must be treated with respect and must be sprinkled (cleaned up). In Sepharad and in the West (Morocco), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to light the candles in the synagogues and extend the blinds on the floor on which the parishioners sit. In the lands of ''Edom'' (Christian lands) in the synagogues people sit on chairs [or benches]\u00bb. (''Hilkhot Tefillah'', 11, 5).</ref>\n\nThe reconquest of Catalonia began under the auspices of the Frankish kings, who forced the Muslims who had managed to cross the Pyrenees at the [[Battle of Poitiers (732)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732 to retreat to the south. All the lands freed from the Islamic domain became counties and remained under the administrative organization of the [[Franks]]. The Catalan counties, led by the counts of Barcelona, slowly broke free from the Franks and began to govern themselves independently. [[Old Catalonia]] became a zone of containment ([[Marca Hispanica]]) against the spread of [[Islam]]. Jews often moved from Sepharad (the Muslim zone) to the northern lands (the Christian kingdoms), and vice versa. The fact that many of them spoke Arabic and also the vernacular Romance languages helped them to serve as translators and acquire important positions in both Muslim and Christian governments. Jews owned fields and vineyards and many of them devoted themselves to agriculture.\n\nIn this early period, the Jewish scholars of Catalonia who sought advanced Talmudic studies used to go to study in the Talmudic academies (''yeshivot'') in the South. Also, those who wanted to study science or linguistics went to Sepharad, as did Rabbi ''[[Menahem ben Saruq|Menachem ben Saruq]]'' (920-970), who was born in the Catalan city of Tortosa and moved with all his family to Cordoba to study and to devote himself to the Hebrew language under the patronage of Governor ''[[Samuel ibn Naghrillah|Shemuel ibn Nagrella]]''.\n\nThe first evidence of an important Jewish settlement in Barcelona and Girona are from the 9th century CE. We know that in the 11th and 12th centuries in Barcelona there was a rabbinical court ''([[Beth din|Bet Din]])'' and an important teaching center of the Torah. In this period, Barcelona became a link in the chain of transmission of the teachings of the ''Geonim''<ref>The period of the ''Gueonim'' dates from the end of the 6th century to the middle of the 11th century.</ref>''.''\n\nImportant Catalonian Rabbis \u00a0from this time are Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Reuben Albargeloni|Yitzchaq ben Reuven al-Bargeloni]]'' (1043 -?), Rabbi ''[[Judah ben Barzillai|Yehudah ben Barzilay ha-Barceloni]]'', called ''Yehudah ha-Nasi'' of Barcelona (late 11th century, beginning of the 12th century) and Rabbi ''[[Abraham bar Hiyya|Avraham bar Chiyya Nasi]]''<ref>Barcelona was well-known like the city of the ''nesiim'' (patriarchs), due to the great amount of personalities that enjoyed this honorific title.</ref> (late 11th century, first half of the 12th century). We know that two of the great ''chachamim'' of Provence, Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Abba Mari|Yitzchaq ben Abba Mari]]'' (1122-1193) and Rabbi [[Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne|''Avraham ben'' Rabbi ''Yitzchaq'']] (1110-1179), moved to Barcelona.\n\nCatalonia joined [[Provence]] in 1112 and [[Aragon]] in 1137, and thus Barcelona became the capital of the unified kingdom called the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The kings of the Crown of Aragon extended their domains to the [[Occitania|Occitan]] countries.\n\n== 12th and 13th centuries ==\n\n[[File:\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\"\u05df.jpg|thumb|Seal attributed to Nachmanides [Copy from the Museum of History of the Jews in Girona]]]\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries the Catalonian Talmudic academies thrived. The great Rabbis and kabbalists ''[[Ezra ben Shelomoh|Ezra]]'' and ''[[Azriel of Gerona|Azriel bene Shelomoh]]'' (late 12th century, beginning of the 13th century) disciples of the famous Rabbi ''[[Isaac the Blind|Yitzchaq el Cec]]'' (the Blind) (1160-1235), son of Rabbi ''[[Abraham ben David|Avraham ben David]]'' ''(Raabad)'' of Posqui\u00e8res (1120-1198), stood out in the city of Girona. We can also include Rabbi ''[[Yaaqov ben Sheshet]]'' (12th century) among the Girona kabbalists of this period. Also, from Girona was Rabbi [[Avraham ben Yitzchaq he-Hazan|''Avraham ben'' ''Yitzchaq'' ''he-Hazan'']] (12th-13th centuries) author of the ''piyyut''<ref>Liturgical poem.</ref> ''Achot qetanah'' (little sister). From the city of Girona was the greatest of Catalonian sages, Rabbi ''[[Nachmanides|Moshe ben Nachman]]'' (''Ramban'', or Nachmanides) (1194-1270), whose Catalonian name was ''Bonastruc \u00e7a Porta''.\n\nAlthough the city of Girona was an important center of Torah that had a Bet Midrash (House of Study) dedicated to the study of the [[Kabbalah]], the main city was Barcelona, where the ''Ramban'' served as the head of the community. During this period, Rabbi ''[[Yonah Gerondi|Yona Girondi]]'' (1210-1263) and his famous disciples Rabbi ''[[Aharon HaLevi|Aharon ben Yosef ha-Levi]]'' of Barcelona ''(Reah)'' (1235-1303) and Rabbi ''[[Shlomo ibn Aderet|Shelomoh ben Adret]] (Rashba)'' (1235-1310). Also, Rabbi ''[[Asher ben Jehiel|Asher ben Yechiel]] (Rosh)'' (1250-1327), his son Rabbi ''[[Jacob ben Asher|Yaaqov ben Asher]] (Baal ha-Turim)'' (1269-1343), and Rabbi ''[[Yom Tov Asevilli|Yom Tov ben Avraham ha-Sevilli]] (Ritba)'' 1250-1330), disciples of ''Rashba'' and ''Reah''. We can say that at that time Barcelona became the most important Talmudic study center in all of the European Jewry. \n[[File:\u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 \u05e8 \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9.jpg|thumb|''Heqdesh rabbi Shemuel ha-Sardi'' in the Old City of Barcelona.|alt=]]\nIn Catalonia in the 13th century Jews were victims of [[blood libel]]s and were forced to wear a distinctive sign called ''Rodella''. The authorities prohibited Jews from performing public office and were forced to participate in public disputes with representatives of Christianity, such as the [[Disputation of Barcelona|Barcelona Disputation]] of 1263 in which the ''Ramban'' participate as a representative of [[Judaism]]. The Jews were private property of the monarchy who charged them taxes in exchange for protection. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ''\u00a0''\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe kings of the Crown of Aragon expanded the Catalan domains and conquered Mallorca, Valencia, Ibiza and Menorca. In 1258 they signed the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Corbeil treaty]] with the French king for which they renounced to their rights over the Occitan lands. In return, the Franks resigned their demands on the Catalan lands.\n\n== 14th century ==\n[[File:Girona - Museu d'Hist\u00f2ria dels Jueus - 20110123 (4).jpg|thumb|Stone commemorating the inauguration of a synagogue in Girona (14th century).]]\nIn the 14th century Christian fanaticism prevailed throughout the Iberian Peninsula and there were many persecutions against the Jews. We can mention among Catalonian sages of this period Rabbi ''[[Peretz Gerondi|Peretz ben Yitzchaq ha-Kohen]]'' (1304-1370) who was born in Provence but dwelled in Barcelona, Rabbi ''[[Nissim of Gerona|Nisim ben Reuven Girondi]] (Ran)'' (1315-1376) who served as a Rabbi in Barcelona, Rabbi ''[[Chasday ben Yehudah Cresques]]'' (the elder), Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Sheshet|Yitzchaq bar Sheshet Perfet]] (Ribash)'' (1326-1408), Rabbi ''[[Hasdai Crescas|Chasday Cresques]] (Rachaq)'' (1340-1412), Rabbi ''[[Profiat Duran|Yitzchaq ben Moshe ha-Levi]]'' (''Profiat Duran, ha-Ephody'') (1350-1415), Rabbi ''[[Simeon ben Zemah Duran|Shimon ben Tzemach Duran]] (Rashbatz)'' (1361-1444). From this same period, we can include the cartographer of Mallorca ''[[Abraham Cresques|Avraham Cresques]]'' (14th century) and the poet ''[[Shelomoh ben Meshullam de Piera]]'' (1310/50-1420/25).\n\nRabbi ''Nisim ben Reuven Girondi (Ran)'' resumed the activity of the Barcelona Yeshivah in the 50s and 60s, after the Jewish community was heavily affected by the [[Black Death]] in 1348. In 1370, Jews of Barcelona were victims of attacks instigated by a blood libel; a few Jews were assassinated and the secretaries of the community were imprisoned in the [[synagogue]] for a few days without food.\n[[File:\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea.jpg|thumb|Seal for the ''Matsot'' (acetic breads) (14th century) [Copy from the History Museum of the Jews in Girona].]]\nThe end of the century brought the revolts of 1391. As a result of the riots, many Jews were forced to convert to Christianity and many others died as martyrs. Others succeeded in fleeing to North Africa (such as ''Ribash'' and ''Rashbatz''), Italy and the Ottoman Empire. It was the end of the Jewish communities of Valencia and Barcelona. The community of Mallorca held out until 1435, when Jews were forced to convert to Christianity; the community of Girona barely endured until the expulsion of 1492.\n\nRabbi ''Chasday Cresques'', in a letter he sent to the Jewish community of [[Avignon]], offers us an account about the riots of 1391.<ref>The letter was published in the book ''Shevet Yehudah'', Rabbi ''Yehudah ibn Verga'' (edition of Hanover, 1924).</ref> In summary, we can conclude from his account that the riots began on the first day of the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew month]] of ''[[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]]'' (Sunday, 4/6/1391) in [[Seville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and close to seventy other locations. From day seven of the month of ''[[Av]]'' (Sunday, 9/7/1391), they extended to other communities of the Crown of Aragon: [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Lleida]], [[Girona]] and [[Mallorca]]. During the 1391 attacks, the majority of the Jewish communities of Sepharad, Catalonia and Aragon were destroyed.\n\nDuring the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the kings of the Crown of Aragon expanded their territories to the lands of the Mediterranean; they conquered [[Sicily]] (1282), [[Corsica]] (1297-1516), [[Athens]] (1311), [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatria]] (1318), [[Sardinia]] (1323-1326) and [[Naples]] (1435-1442).\n\n== 15th century ==\nThe fifteenth century was very hard for Jewish life in the Iberian Peninsula. The communities that survived the 1391 riots faced great pressure on the part of the church and the Christian population. The kings, who were in a difficult economic situation, imposed heavy taxes on Jewish communities. The lives of the \u201cConverso\u201d Jews who converted to Christianity was not easy either, the church called them \u201c[[new Christian]]s\u201d and they always kept them under suspicion, since many of them accepted Christianity only as an outward pretense but actually maintained Judaism in secret. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] persecuted and punished the new Christians who observed the commandments of Judaism.\n\nCatalonia hosted one of the longest disputes in the Middle Ages, the famous [[Disputation of Tortosa|Dispute of Tortosa]] (1413-1414). In the 15th century, we find the poet ''[[Solomon ben Reuben Bonfed|Shelomoh ben Reuven Bonafed]]'' in Catalonia.\n\nIn 1469 King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando of Aragon]] (1452-1516) and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel of Castile]] (1451-1504) married and unified the two kingdoms. In 1492 they completed the reconquest with the defeat of the [[Emirate of Granada|Kingdom of Granada]] and expelled Jews from all of their kingdoms.\n\n== The diaspora of the Jews of Catalonia ==\nThe first group of exiled Jews of Catalonia came out in the wake of the 1391 attacks, they went mainly to Italy ([[Sicily]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Livorno]]), North Africa ([[Algeria]]) and the Ottoman Empire (mainly [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]], [[Constantinople]] and the [[Land of Israel]]). The second group came into exile following the expulsion of the Catholic kings. The Edict was decreed on March 31, 1492, and time was given to Jews to sell their properties and leave until July 31, which, according to the Hebrew calendar, fell that year on the eve of the eight of the month ''Av'', which means that the Jews were traveling on the ships expelled on [[Tisha B'Av|9th of ''Av'']]. A large number of Jews converted to Christianity in order to remain in Catalonia.\n\n=== Settlement in Italy ===\nMany of the Catalonian Jews arrived in Italy and found refuge in Sicily, Naples, Livorno and the city of Rome.\n\n==== Sicily ====\n[[File:Aron di Agira.jpg|thumb|''Aron ha-Qodesh'' (Torah Scrolls Ark) of the Catalonian Jewish community of Agira, Sicily (1453).]]\nWe know that Jews from the Iberian Peninsula settled in Sicily since the 11th century.<ref>In some manuscripts preserved in the Cairo Genizah, we find Jews called the 'Sephardic' or the 'Andalusi'. See: Menahem ben Sassoon, ''Yehude Sicilia, teudot u-meqorot'', Jerusalem: 1991 (in Hebrew).</ref> The famous Kabbalist Rabbi ''[[Abraham Abulafia|Avraham Abulafia]]'' (1240-1291), who studied many years in Catalonia, settled in Sicily, where he wrote most of his works.<ref>Moshe Idel, \u00abThe Ecstatic Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia in Sicily and its Transmission during the Renaissance\u00bb, ''Italia Judaica V: Atti del V Convegno internazionale (Palermo, 15-19 giugno 1992)'', Roma: Ministerio per i benni culturali e ambientali, pp. 330-340.</ref> Sicily had been part of the Catalan-Aragonese crown for many years and the Jewish communities remained on the island until the end of the 15th century, with the expulsion edict of the Jews of the island on June 18, 1492. We know of the existence of a Catalan Jewish community in the island thanks to the identification of a manuscript<ref>In ''Sidur Catalunya'', the manuscript Parma Palatina 1750 is identified as ''nusach'' Catalonia. Before the reading of the Torah of Shabbat there appears the \"blessing of the king\" in which King Don Fadrique of Aragon is mentioned, surely it is King Fadrique III (1341-1377) who reigned in Sicily during 1355-1377. This manuscript represents the first document that refers to the Catalan Jewish community of Sicily, which as we can see already existed before the 1391 revolts.</ref> of the 14th century as ''siddur'' ''nusach'' Catalonia.<ref>Until today, it was supposed that the migratory wave of Catalan Jews in Sicily began as a result of the 1391 revolts.

In 1517 the Catalonian Jewish community of Rome was well organized and built a synagogue following the ''minhag''<ref>Tradition, custom.</ref> Catalonia (''Schola hebreorum Nationis Catalanorum'').<ref>The archive documents were published in: Ariel Toaff, \u00abThe jewish communities of Catalonia, Aragon and Castile in 16th century Rome\u00bb, Ariel Toaff, Simon Schwarzfuchs (eds.), ''The Mediterranean and the Jews.

By the end of 1527, the Catalonian community and the Aragonese community decided to merge. The joint synagogue of Catalonia and Aragon changed its location again in 1549. In 1555, the community approved the expenses for the construction of another synagogue. The Catalan-Aragonese community fought to avoid merging with the Sephardic communities. All other communities from the Iberian Peninsula merged into a single united Iberian community in Rome, except for the Catalonians who joined the Aragonese. With the establishment of the [[ghetto]] in 1555, the Catalonian community maintained its own separate synagogue. In a census of 1868, it can be observed that of the total of 4995 Jews in Rome, 838 belonged to the community of Catalonia. In 1904 the Catalan synagogue ended up joining the other synagogues of Rome to form a single synagogue that was constructed on the banks of the [[Tiber]] River. Since then we have no information about the Catalonian community.\n\n=== Settlement in the Ottoman Empire ===\nThe exiled Jews of Catalonia also migrated to the Ottoman Empire where they were organized in communities according to the place of origin that were called ''Qehalim''.<ref>They were organized in seven ''Qehalim'' called: Catalan, Aragon, Castilla, Lisbon, Guerush Sepharad, Mallorca and Sicily.</ref> There were Catalonian ''Qehalim'' in [[Istanbul]], [[Edirne]], [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]] and [[Safed]], among others.<ref>The censuses were published in: Simon Schwarzfuchs, \u00abLa Catalogne et l'invention de Sepharad\u00bb, ''Actes del I Congr\u00e9s per a l'estudi dels jueus en territori de llengua catalana: Barcelona-Girona, del 15 al 17 d'octubre de 2001'', Barcelona: Publicacions i Edicions de la Universitat de Barcelona, 2004, pp. 185-208.</ref>\n\n==== The Catalonian Jewish Community of Salonica ====\nThe Jews of Catalonia formed a [[History of the Jews in Thessaloniki|community in Salonica]] that was called \u201cCatalan\u201d.<ref>The cemetery of the Jewish community of Salonica was established in the 16th century and was destroyed in 1943. Nowadays, the University of Salonica is in the same place. Although the tombstones were destroyed some local researchers transcribed the inscriptions, so the text of the funeral tombstones of the Catalan community has been preserved.</ref> Despite being a minority, the Catalonian Jews fought to avoid merging with the Sephardic communities and maintained their ancient customs. The religious leaders of the holy communities of Catalonia in Salonica received the title of ''Marbitz Torah''<ref>Torah teacher, religious community leader.</ref> and not the title Rabbi. The first known was ''[[Eliezer ha-Shimoni]]'', who arrived in Salonica in 1492. He had a great influence on all the communities of Salonica and was one of the first to sign the agreements ''(Haskamot)'' of the sages. Later we find ''[[Moshe Capsali]]''. The ''chacham'' ''[[Yehudah ben Benveniste]]'', also arrived after the expulsion and established a very important library. Another ''chacham'' from the Catalonian Jewish community was Rabbi ''[[Moshe Almosnino]]'', ''Marbitz Torah'', exegete and philosopher, son of ''[[Barukh Almosnino]]'', who had rebuilt the Catalonian synagogue after the fire of 1545.<ref>In the ''Responsa'' of Rabbi ''Samuel de Medina'', he ruled in favor of ''Moshe Almosnino'' in order to build a Synagogue of the holy community of Catalonia.</ref>\n\nIn 1515, the community was divided into two ''Qehalim'' that were called ''Catalan yashan'' (Old Catalan) and ''Catalan chadash'' (New Catalan).<ref>We find witnesses of this division in the ''Responsa'' of Rabbi ''David Ben Zimra (Radbaz)'', first part, 292.</ref>\n[[File:52 A 347.jpg|thumb|''Machzor'' according to the rite of Barcelona and the custom of Catalonia.

In the second volume ''\"Tefillat Yaaqov\"'', there is a long historical introduction about the Jewish community of Catalonia and the edition of the ''machzor'' written in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Judeo-Spanish]];<ref>The Sephardic community (Castile) became the largest and most influential in Salonica, which was how the Judeo-Spanish language (also called ''Ladino, Judezmo, Spa\u00f1olit'', etc.) became the lingua franca of all Jewish communities (including those of Catalonia, France and Ashkenaz).</ref> the same summary introduction is found in the first volume ''\"Tefillat Shemuel \"'', written in Hebrew. Below is a fragment of the translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version:\n\n\u00abOne of the most precious pearls that our ancestors brought from the exile of Catalonia, when they had to leave as exiles, was the old order of the prayers of ''Rosh ha-Shana'' and ''Yom Kippur'', known as ''the 'nusach Barcelona, minhag Catalunya'''.\n\nAnd because of the misfortunes and tumult of the exile, that arrived of fatal form on the poor wandering refugees, the majority of the customs were confused, and slowly, almost all were fused in the same order of prayers called ''<nowiki/>'nusach Sepharad''', almost all, except some exceptional communities that did not change their customs.\n\nThe members of the Holy community Catalonia in our city of Salonica did not change their custom, and until today they maintain the tradition of their ancestors and offer their prayers to God on Days of Awe following the ancient ''nusach'' that they brought from Catalonia.\n\nThe Jews of Catalonia were the most prominent among their brothers in the rest of the Sepharad countries and their wisdom and science were superior. The distinguished communities of Barcelona always took pride in the fact that great Rabbis and personalities from their community illuminated the eyes of the whole Jewish diaspora. There was a saying that Sephardic Jews used to say: the air of Barcelona, it makes you wise. \u00bb \u00a0\n\nThe Catalonian Jewish community of Salonica was totally annihilated in the Holocaust. The few survivors emigrated to [[Israel]] after the war between the years 1945 and 1947.\n\n=== Settlement in North Africa (Algeria) ===\nThe coasts of Catalonia, Valencia and Mallorca are in front of the coast of Algeria. These lands long maintained commercial relations; also, the Jewish communities maintained close ties. After the riots of 1391, a large group of Catalonian Jews fled to the coasts of Algeria. We know that most of the Jews of Barcelona fled and settled in the city of Algiers. At that time, three kingdoms were established in North Africa after the fall of the Almohad, one in the area of present-day [[Morocco]], another in [[Tunisia]] and a third in [[Algeria]], which was ruled by the dynasty of ''Beni-Ziyan'' from the ancient capital of [[Tlemcen]]. In general, the Jews of Castile went to Morocco, while the Jews of Catalonia, Valencia, Mallorca and Aragon went to Algeria and Tunisia.\n\n==== The Jews of Algiers ====\n[[File:56A346.jpg|thumb|''Machzor Qatan'', according to the custom of the Holy communities of Algiers, Livorno, 1886.<ref>National Library of Israel R 56 A 346.</ref>]]\n\nThe Muslim rulers of Algeria received the Jewish exiles with open arms. As soon as the Christian authorities saw that Jews and converts fled to Algeria, they forbade them from leaving the country, increased their persecution and flight became more difficult. The Jews who settled in Algeria received the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s,'' as is usual in Islamic countries in exchange for paying taxes. The situation of Jews in Algeria before the arrival of the exiles was very poor, both their economic situation and the level of Torah studies. Peninsular refugees contributed to raising the country's economy thanks to commercial activities with European lands and also improved the level of Torah studies.\n\nTwo of the great later ''Rishonim'', Rabbi ''[[Isaac ben Sheshet|Yitzhaq bar Sheshet Perfet]] (Ribash)''<ref>The ''Ribash'' was for many years the great Rabbi of Catalonia.</ref> and Rabbi ''[[Simeon ben Zemah Duran|Shimon ben Tzemac\u1e25 Duran]] (Rashbatz)''<ref>The ''Rashbatz'', had been dedicated in Mallorca to the medical profession. Once in Algeria, where there was not so much demand for this profession, he was forced to earn a living as a rabbi. (''Maguen Avot'', chap. 4, 45).</ref> fled to Algeria. ''Ribash'' had long been the grand Rabbi of Catalonia, and ''Rashbatz'', despite his great preparation and knowledge of the Torah, had been dedicated to the medical profession. After a while, ''Ribash'' was named ''Mara de-Atra'' (maximum rabbinical authority) and head of the Rabbinic Court of the Algiers community, and ''Rashbatz'' was appointed ''Dayan'' (judge) to his court. When ''Ribash'' died, ''Rashbatz'' occupied his place. The Jews of Algeria accepted the authority of these two great Rabbis, who were followed by the descendants of ''Rashbatz'', his son Rabbi ''[[Shelomo ben Shimon]] (Rashbash)'' and his disciples. Throughout the generations, the Jews of Algeria have faithfully and meticulously maintained the spiritual legacy and customs that came from Catalonia. Until today, ''Ribash'', ''Rashbatz'' and ''Rashbash'' are considered the main Rabbis of Algiers.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the manner of dictating ''halakhah'' by the Rabbis of Algiers throughout generations has been respect for customs and traditions; the established custom has always trumped ''halakha'', and this is a characteristic that was inherited from ''Bet Midrash'' of the ''Ramban''. Matters of ''halakha'' in Algiers have always been dictated following the school of ''Ribash, Rashbatz'' and ''Rashbash'', and not according to the opinions of ''Maran ha-Bet Yosef'' (''[[Joseph Karo|Yosef Caro]]'', and his work the ''[[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan Arukh]]'').<ref>For example, Rabbi ''Refael Yedidya Shelomo Tzror'' (1682-1729), author of the work ''<nowiki/>'Pri Tzadiq''', wrote in his introduction to the ''Taixbetz'' book: \u00abIn Algiers the local custom is followed, and legal decisions are not issued according to the ''Bet Yosef'' \u00bb.</ref> In fact, the Jews of Algiers followed the ''halakhic'' dictation inherited from the Catalan ''Bet Midrash'' of the ''Ramban'' and the ''Rashba''. Thus, for example, Rabbi ''Avraham ibn Taua'' (1510-1580),<ref>Rabbi ''Avraham ibn Taua'' was a descendant of the ''Rashabtz'', and at the same time of the ''Ramban'', and served as the head of the Algerian ''Yeshivah''. His ''Responsa'' were compiled in two books, one of which was published in the third part of the book ''<nowiki/>'Chut ha-meshulash''', and that the printers added to the fourth volume of the ''<nowiki/>'Tashbetz' Responsa'' book.</ref> grandson of ''Rashbatz'', responded to a question asked by the Rabbis of Fez on a matter referring to the laws of ''[[Shabbat]]'':<ref>''Tashbetz'', vol. 4 (''<nowiki/>'Chut ha-meshulash'''), 3, 10.</ref>\n\n\u00abAnswer: Dear Rabbis, God guard you; know that we are [descendants of] the expelled from the land of Catalonia, and according to what our parents of blessed memory used in those lands, we also used in these places where we have dispersed because of our sins. You know that the Rabbis of Catalonia, according to the dictates on which all the customs of our community are based, are ''Ramban'', ''Rashba'', ''Reah'' and ''Ran'', of blessed memory, and other great Rabbis who accompanied them in their generation, although their opinions were not published. Therefore, you do not have to question the customs of our community, since as long as you cannot find any of the issues explicitly mentioned in the books, it should be assumed that they followed the custom according to these great Rabbis. \u00bb\n\nAlso, regarding the order of prayers and ''piyyutim'', the Jews of Algiers were strictly conservative with the customs that came from Catalonia. ''Machzor minhag'' Algiers, for example, arrived from Catalonia around 1391.<ref>Rabbi ''Yitzchaq Morali'' (1867-1952), in his introduction to ''machzor minhag'' Alger, writes: \"This machzor was brought by our Sepharad parents when they fled from the ravages of 1391, and our Rabbis ''Ribash'' and ''Rashbatz'', of holy and blessed memory, kept it. And thus, accustomed the later generations\u00bb.</ref>\n[[File:\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05e5.jpg|thumb|''Chokhmat Misken: ve-hu sefer Qrovats'', Livorno, 1772.<ref>[https://rosetta.nli.org.il/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE84117009 National Library of Israel R 23 V 2883].</ref>]]\nIn the eighteenth century, scholars questioned some of the ancient customs saying that they contradicted the dictates of Rabbi ''[[Isaac Luria|Yitzchaq Luria Ashkenazi]] (Arizal)'' (1534-1572). The old custom that came from Catalonia consisted of reciting ''piyyutim'' (and also prayers and supplications) in the middle of prayer. They argued that the custom of the city had to be changed. So, they began to change the ''nusach'' of the prayers that had been in force in Algiers since ancient times. The Algerian Rabbis \u00a0opposed this development, arguing that the old custom could not be changed,<ref>See: Shelomo Ouaknin, \u00abTeshuvot chakhme Algir ve-Tunis be-inyan shinui be-minhag ha-tefillah be-Algir\u00bb, ''Mekabtziel'' 39, pp. 33-102 (in Hebrew).</ref> but in the following generations, most synagogues in the city of Algiers did change the rite of prayer and adopted the custom of the ''Arizal'' (known as the custom of the Kabbalists, ''minhag ha-mequbalim'').<ref>''Minhag ha-mequbalim'' was established around 1765.</ref> Only two synagogues maintained the ancient custom (known as the custom of literalists, ''minhag ha-pashtamim''): The Great Synagogue and the synagogue ''Yakhin u-Boaz'' (later renamed Guggenheim Society).\n\nThe ''piyyutim'' mentioned above, which are recited on special ''Shabbatot'' and festivals, etc., were edited in a book called ''Qrovatz''.<ref>Nehoray ben Seadya Azoviv, ''<nowiki/>'Chokhmat Misk\u00e9n: ve-hu sefer Qrovatz she-nahagu leomram ha-qahal ha-qadosh she-be-ir Argel''', Livorno 1772.</ref> The Jews from Algiers have maintained the texts and melodies that arrived in Algiers during the period of the ''Ribash'' and the ''Rashbatz'' until the present day. According to the tradition, these are the original melodies that arrived from Catalonia with the two great Rabbis.<ref>In the synagogues where ''minhag ha-mequbalim'' was imposed, they also maintained the melodies and ''nusach'' of ''piyyutim'', although they were told outside the ''tefillah (amidah)'' and the blessings of the ''Shema'' reading, as is nowadays accustomed to the ''minhag'' of the Sephardim.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the annual Ethnomusicology Workshop was held,<ref>The workshop was organized by the faculty of music of the University of Bar-Illan with the collaboration of the phonotheque of the National Library of Israel and the Jewish Music Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</ref> which focused on the customs and liturgical tradition of the Jews of Algeria.<ref>Edwin Seroussi & Eric Karsenti, \u00abThe Study of Liturgical Music of Algerian Jewry\u00bb. ''Pe\u2019amim'' 91 (2002), pp. 31-50.</ref> Algerian cantors from France and Israel attended. The workshop was recorded and today the recordings can be listened to on the website of the National Library of Israel. The liturgy of ''Shabbat, Rosh Chodesh, Yamim Noraim'', festivals, fasts and ''piyyutim'' for various celebrations were recorded. Although more than 600 years have elapsed, and there have been certain alterations, we can affirm that the uniqueness of the liturgical tradition of the Jews of Algiers largely preserves the medieval tradition of liturgical songs of the Jews of Catalonia.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Yitzhak Baer, ''A history of the Jews in Christian Spain'', Philadelphia : Jewish Publication Society of America, 1961-1966.\n* Jean R\u00e9gn\u00e9, ''History of the Jews in Aragon: regesta and documents, 1213-1327'' Jerusalem: 1978.\n* Yom Tov Assis, ''The Golden Age of Aragonese Jewry.

{"title_page": "History of the Jews in Campania and Basilicata", "text_new": "{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}\n\nThe '''History of the Jews in Campania and Basilicata''' is at least 2000 years old. This area, which is a mix of mountains and rich fertile plains, is south of Rome but north of [[Calabria]] and [[Apulia]]. Most of the Jewish communities were settled in the Roman Era by Jewish merchants or by Jewish captives after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in the year 70.

The first records for the Jews living in Amalfi dates from the tenth century. The [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel|Chronicle of Ahimaaz]] mentions the Jews of Amalfi. The famous [[Cairo Geniza]] also mentions the Jews of Amalfi. The Jews of Amalfi were a small community, engaged in silk manufacture, garment dyeing and trade. [[Benjamin of Tudela]] writes of some 20 Jewish families there in about 1159. In 1292, measures were taken to convert the Jews to Christianity. Most Jews were banished along with the rest of the Jews in the area. The Jewish community in Amalfi was resurrected by 1306.

In 1442, Alfonso of Aragon became the ruler of the area and granted some privileges to the Jews. However, in 1458, after Alfonso's death, Benevento returned to pontifical rule. Under Papal rule, Benevento was spared the Jewish expulsion from southern Italy by the Spanish Crown in 1541. Unfortunately, after the election of Pope [[Paul IV]] in 1555, the Jews felt increasing pressure to convert and several Jews did convert, among them a Jew by the name of Raphael Usiglio.

In 1231, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] granted the Jews the monopoly of the dye-works in the area. During the Jewish persecutions in southern Italy in 1290\u201394, many Jews in Capua were forcibly baptized to Christianity. From the 13th to 15th century, the Jewish community in Capua was known for its bankers and physicians. In 1464 the Jews of area, including Capua, complained to [[King Alfonso]] about the burden of taxation taxes were so large that many Jews threatened to leave the kingdom. The king obliged and lowed the taxes. The Jewish community grew when Sephardic refugees from Spain and Sicily arrived in Capua in 1492 and 1493.

In 1288, the [[Kingdom of Naples]] issued an expulsion order for the Jews and in 1293 any Jews still in Naples were forced to convert.\n\nIn 1492, many Jews who were expelled from Spain came to Naples, where [[King Ferdinand of Naples]] protected them. However, in 1495, the French conquered the kingdom and persecution resumed. In 1510, Spain won control of the city and expelled the Jews, but those who paid 300 ducanti were permitted to stay. In 1535, the last Jews in Naples were gone. \nIn 1735, Jews were permitted to return to Naples. In 1831, a small group of Jews settled in the city. By 1841, the [[Rothschild banking family of Naples|Rothschild family]], acquired the [[Villa Pignatelli]] which served as the Jewish centre.\n\nNaples's Jewish population in the 1920s were almost 1,000 members. Between 1942 and 1943, 50 Jews of Naples were saved from German deportation by being hidden by villagers in the area of [[Caserta]].

The community they founded became the hub of the [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] speaking Baghdadi Jewish trading diaspora in Asia. \n\nIn the early [[19th century|nineteenth century]] the community grew rapidly, drawing mostly on Jewish migrants from Baghdad and to a lesser extent on those  from Aleppo. Historically it was led by a flourishing merchant elite trading in cotton, jute, spices and opium issued from the leading Jewish families of Baghdad and Aleppo. \n\nMercantile Baghdadi Jewish families based in the city tied together through bonds of marriage or commerce the smaller Baghdadi Jewish communities trading across Asia including in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] with the larger Jewish  communities in [[Mumbai]] and the [[Middle East]]. \n\nDuring the late nineteenth century Kolkata was a minor intellectual centre of [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi Jews]] before the Baghdadi Jews began to slowly transition from a [[Mizrahi Jews|Judeo-Arabic]] identity towards a more [[British Jews|Judeo-British]] and one under the leadership of the mercantile Sassoon, Ezra, Elias, Gubbay, Belilios and Judah families. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhKGPprbQaYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=joseph+judah+opium+calcutta&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi605_BiZPnAhVaAZ0JHdDeCYk4ChDoATAJegQIARBB#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Jews of India: A Story of Three Communities|last=Yisrael|first=Muzeon|date=1995|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-965-278-179-6|language=en}}</ref> In their heyday such mercantile Kolkata Jews sponsored numerous leading religious and charitable institutions in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]].  \n\nDuring the mid [[20th century|twentieth century]] the Baghdadi Jewish community peaked at over 6,000 members during the [[World War II|Second World War]] as smaller communities fled [[Japanese invasion of Singapore|Japanese invasions]] or internments. This highpoint was followed by a precipitously decline in numbers. The community largely emigrate after Indian independence in 1947, leaving overwhelmingly to London and to a lesser extent Israel. This migration followed the turmoil of [[Partition of India|partition]], the breakdown of the colonial trading system in Asia, severing historic trade flows between the Middle East and Asia, and the birth of a Jewish state in Palestine.

It attracted numerous trading communities including the Jews. The first recorded Jewish immigrant to Kolkata was Shalom Aharon Obadiah Cohen, who arrived in Kolkata in 1798. Cohen was born in [[Aleppo]] in present-day [[Syria]] in 1762. He arrived in [[Surat Thani Province|Surat]] in the year 1792 and established himself as a trader before moving to Kolkata. In 1805, his nephew Moses Simon Duek Ha Cohen arrived in Kolkata. He married his eldest daughter Lunah. In the early nineteenth century the Baghdadi Jews began to settle in large numbers in Kolkata, thus outnumbering the Jews from Aleppo. \n\nThe community grew rapidly, in terms of both size and prestige, as Jews from Iraq fled the persecution of the rule [[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad|Dawud Pasha]] (1817-1831) in what was then a province of the Ottoman Empire, including many of the most illustrious families of Baghdad.

They continuously strove to maintain a balance between embracing the European culture that characterized the mostly British elite upper class to which they aspired, and a steadfast fidelity to their ancestral faith and traditions. They expressed their devotion to Jewish traditions through the sponsoring of elaborate synagogues, religious seminaries, ritual scrolls and books across Asia and the Middle East. \n\nNevertheless, the identity of the community evolved. The first generation of Jewish settlers in Kolkata in the early 19th century spoke [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] at home and adhered to their Arabic style of costumes in public. Slowly and unevenly this began to change as their the second generation of Jews born in Kolkata adopted European dress and lifestyle and English as their language of communication. By 1906 it was recorded that as amongst the wealthier Jews in their habits and dress were European though their vernacular remained Arabic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3917-calcutta|title=CALCUTTA - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> Amongst lower social classes older generations retained Arabic style of dress while younger generations had adopted the European one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3917-calcutta|title=CALCUTTA - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> Their identities evolved too from a Judeo-Arabic identity towards a Judeo-British one.

Late Twentieth Century.jpg|thumb|A Baghdadi Jewish man contemplates his heritage, late 20th century.]]\nThe '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Kolkata]],''' formerly known as '''Calcutta''', in [[India]], began in the late eighteenth century when adventurous [[Baghdadi Jews|Baghdadi Jewish]] merchants originally from [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]] chose to establish themselves permanently in the emerging capital of the [[British Raj]]. The community they founded became the hub of the [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] speaking Baghdadi Jewish trading diaspora in Asia. \n\nIn the early [[19th century|nineteenth century]] the community grew rapidly, drawing mostly on Jewish migrants from Baghdad and to a lesser extent on those  from Aleppo. Historically it was led by a flourishing merchant elite trading in cotton, jute, spices and opium issued from the leading Jewish families of Baghdad and Aleppo. \n\nMercantile Baghdadi Jewish families based in the city tied together through bonds of marriage or commerce the smaller Baghdadi Jewish communities trading across Asia including in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] with the larger Jewish  communities in [[Mumbai]] and the [[Middle East]]. \n\nDuring the late nineteenth century Kolkata was a minor intellectual centre of [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi Jews]] before the Baghdadi Jews began to slowly transition from a [[Mizrahi Jews|Judeo-Arabic]] identity towards a more [[British Jews|Judeo-British]] and one under the leadership of the mercantile Sassoon, Ezra, Elias, Gubbay, Belilios and Judah families. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhKGPprbQaYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=joseph+judah+opium+calcutta&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi605_BiZPnAhVaAZ0JHdDeCYk4ChDoATAJegQIARBB#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Jews of India: A Story of Three Communities|last=Yisrael|first=Muzeon|date=1995|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-965-278-179-6|language=en}}</ref> In their heyday such mercantile Kolkata Jews sponsored numerous leading religious and charitable institutions in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]].  \n\nDuring the mid [[20th century|twentieth century]] the Baghdadi Jewish community peaked at over 6,000 members during the [[World War II|Second World War]] as smaller communities fled [[Japanese invasion of Singapore|Japanese invasions]] or internments. This highpoint was followed by a precipitously decline in numbers. The community largely emigrate after Indian independence in 1947, leaving overwhelmingly to London and to a lesser extent Israel. This migration followed the turmoil of [[Partition of India|partition]], the breakdown of the colonial trading system in Asia, severing historic trade flows between the Middle East and Asia, and the birth of a Jewish state in Palestine.

It attracted numerous trading communities including the Jews. The first recorded Jewish immigrant to Kolkata was Shalom Aharon Obadiah Cohen, who arrived in Kolkata in 1798. Cohen was born in [[Aleppo]] in present-day [[Syria]] in 1762. He arrived in [[Surat Thani Province|Surat]] in the year 1792 and established himself as a trader before moving to Kolkata. In 1805, his nephew Moses Simon Duek Ha Cohen arrived in Kolkata. He married his eldest daughter Lunah. In the early nineteenth century the Baghdadi Jews began to settle in large numbers in Kolkata, thus outnumbering the Jews from Aleppo. \n\nThe community grew rapidly, in terms of both size and prestige, as Jews from Iraq fled the persecution of the rule [[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad|Dawud Pasha]] (1817-1831) in what was then a province of the Ottoman Empire, including many of the most illustrious families of Baghdad.

They continuously strove to maintain a balance between embracing the European culture that characterized the mostly British elite upper class to which they aspired, and a steadfast fidelity to their ancestral faith and traditions. They expressed their devotion to Jewish traditions through the sponsoring of elaborate synagogues, religious seminaries, ritual scrolls and books across Asia and the Middle East. \n\nNevertheless the identity of the community evolved. The first generation of Jewish settlers in Kolkata in the early 19th century spoke [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] at home and adhered to their Arabic style of costumes in public. Slowly and unevenly this began to change as their the second generation of Jews born in Kolkata adopted European dress and lifestyle and English as their language of communication. By 1906 it was recorded that as amongst the wealthier Jews in their habits and dress were European though their vernacular remained Arabic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3917-calcutta|title=CALCUTTA - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> Amongst lower social classes older generations retained Arabic style of dress while younger generations had adopted the European one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3917-calcutta|title=CALCUTTA - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> Their identities evolved too from a Judeo-Arabic identity towards a Judeo-British one.
