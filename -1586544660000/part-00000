The screen will display a map similar to the strip maps on the R142s, R142As, R143s, and R188s. It will have the ability to display more colors instead of just red, orange and green. When the train is at a station, two screens will be shown. The left side of the screen will display the station name, as well as the transfers and connections at that station (if there are any). The right side of the screen will show the stairs in the station and the train car the passenger is currently in (designated by the words \u201cYou are here\u201d).{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/R-110_New_Technology_Test_Program nycsubway.org: R-110 New Technology Test Program]\n* [http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/New_Technology_Trains_-_A_Division nycsubway.org: New Technology Trains - A Division]\n* [http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/New_Technology_Trains_-_B_Division nycsubway.org: New Technology Trains - B Division]\n\n{{NYCS rolling stock}}\n\n[[Category:New York City Subway rolling stock]]\n", "name_user": "MTAEnthusiast10", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurrent", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Technology_Train"}
