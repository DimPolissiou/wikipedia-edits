Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ. We are exalted by joy, we are hovering between shining spheres, which have become the center of a world.\"<ref name=\"pet3\">{{cite web\n |title        = Stairs that continue to reveal themselves: the church of the Petraio and the villa where Paul Klee lived\n |publisher    = Vomero Magazine\n |author       = Identitainsorgenti.com\n |date         = October 4, 2017\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.identitainsorgenti.com%2Fnapoli-a-piedi-scale-che-continuano-a-svelarsi-la-chiesa-del-petraio-e-la-villa-dove-dimoro-paul-klee%2F}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the film [[The Four Days of Naples]], in the early stages of the Neapolitan uprising, a young man can be heard shouting: \"Pe 'e criatur' ro Petraio!\".\n*Popularly, the expression salir\u00e8 'ncoppo' is used in Santar\u00e8lla , which indicates the need to go from the Petraio to Villa La Santarella and Piazza Vanvitelli .\n*Author [[Nicola Pugliese]] in his book ''Malacqua'', cites Petraio, describing the origin of his name.\n\n==See Also==\n[[Stairways in Naples]]<br>\n[[Matera]]\n\n{{coord|40|50|35.8728|N|14|14|10.7016|E|display=title|region:IT_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petraio}}\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Naples]]\n[[Category:Zones of Naples]]\n\n==External References==\n* [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=it&rurl=translate.google.it&sl=it&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.scaledinapoli.com/&usg=ALkJrhjlxbq3eRVLr6oflxJlrzYoms77hA Stairways of Naples]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraio"}

Mahadev,''''' ({{lang-eng|Lord of the Lords... Mahadev}})  often abbreviated as '''\"DKDM\"''', is a [[drama series|spiritual series]] based on the legends of the [[Hindu god|Hindu god]] Lord [[Shiva]], also known as Mahadev. It premiered on 18 December 2011 airing Monday through Friday nights on [[Life OK]].  It was dubbed into several languages.  \n\nThe show ran until 14 December 2014 for a total of 820 episodes. \n\nThe show was re-aired on [[Star Bharat]] from 5 August 2018.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter [[Lord Shiva]] curses [[Lord Brahma]] and cuts his fifth head, his son [[Prajapati]] Daksh starts hating Shiva but his daughter, [[Adi-Shakti]] [[Sati]] falls for Shiva and marries him, offending Daksh. Filled with hatred, Prajapati Daksh humiliates Shiva-Sati due to which Sati takes a drastic step and destroys herself. Mahadev goes into deep meditation for centuries. \n\nAdi-Shakti is reborned as [[Parvati]] in King Himavan's kingdom as his daughter. Parvati succeeds in gaining Mahadev's confidence and marries him. The latter shows the birth of [[Karthikeya]] and Vinayaka's rebirth as [[Ganesha]] which makes Mahadev, a family man from an ascetic which was necessary for shaping the universe. \n\nA series of circumstances including Shiva-Shakti destroying their own blood [[Jalandhara]] and [[Andhaka]], saving the universe from various miseries and teaching people moral values via different avatars of Mahadev and Parvati makes the bond between them even more strong. The show ends with the birth of Ganesha's son, Shubh and Labh who brings happiness to the world and Mahadev's teaching about unity.\n\n==List of characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

Mahadev}})  often abbreviated as '''\"DKDM\"''', is a [[drama series|spiritual series]] based on the legends of the [[Hindu god|Hindu god]] Lord [[Shiva]], also known as Mahadev. It premiered on 18 December 2011 airing Monday through Friday nights on [[Life OK]].  It was dubbed into several languages.  \n\nThe show ran until 14 December 2014 for a total of 820 episodes. \n\nThe show was re-aired on [[Star Bharat]] from 5 August 2018.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter [[Lord Shiva]] curses [[Lord Brahma]] and cuts his fifth head, his son [[Prajapati]] Daksh starts hating Shiva but his daughter, [[Adi-Shakti]] [[Sati]] falls for Shiva and marries him, offending Daksh. Filled with hatred, Prajapati Daksh humiliates Shiva-Sati due to which Sati takes a drastic step and destroys herself. Mahadev goes into deep meditation for centuries. \n\nAdi-Shakti is reborned as [[Parvati]] in King Himavan's kingdom as his daughter. Parvati succeeds in gaining Mahadev's confidence and marries him. The latter shows the birth of [[Karthikeya]] and Vinayaka's rebirth as [[Ganesha]] which makes Mahadev, a family man from an ascetic which was necessary for shaping the universe. \n\nA series of circumstances including Shiva-Shakti destroying their own blood [[Jalandhara]] and [[Andhaka]], saving the universe from various miseries and teaching people moral values via different avatars of Mahadev and Parvati makes the bond between them even more strong. The show ends with the birth of Ganesha's son, Shubh and Labh who brings happiness to the world and Mahadev's teaching about unity.\n\n==List of characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

The island has one road connection to the mainland, via [[Washington State Route 532|State Route 532]] over the [[Camano Gateway Bridge]] at the northeast end of the island, connecting to the city of [[Stanwood, Washington|Stanwood]].\n\nThe island has a total area of {{convert|39.77|sqmi|sqkm}}, making it one of the largest in the state of Washington.

Based on later reports, the club has a claim to have been established some time in 1860 in the twin villages of [[St. Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]], near [[Orpington]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vain Games of No Value by Terry Morris | publisher = Author House| date = 2016 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GrfCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT122&lpg=PT122&dq=Cray+Wanderers+1860&source=bl&ots=6YFc0q4QOr&sig=vX_cTjNOLwV-y_5PxSe0B5S7eiI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT-fifn8XMAhWE6xQKHeqGAGM4HhDoAQhNMAg#v=onepage&q=Cray%20Wanderers%201860&f=false | accessdate = 15 September 2016}}</ref> Such a date would make it one of the [[oldest football club]]s in the world.\n\nThey currently play their home matches at [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s [[Hayes Lane]] ground (capacity 5,000). Cray Wanderers were [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] champions four times, and have reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]] once in their history. They are currently members of the {{English football updater|CrayWand}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first origins of Cray Wanderers are linked to the construction of the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] line during 1858 to 1860.<ref name=\"OHist\"/> During their leisure time, migrant workers kicked a ball around, and that is how the club originated in the [[St Mary Cray]] village. The pitch at Star Lane is now a cemetery, and is located beneath the nine-arch railway viaduct that spans the Cray Valley. The industrial belt of the [[River Cray]], especially the paper mills, provided much of the club's support up till the 1950s.\n   \nCray Wanderers were a strong force in senior county football at the turn of the century. After being Kent Junior Cup semi-finalists and finalists in 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 they entered the first ever [[FA Amateur Cup]] competition in 1893\u201394. They had a spell as a professional club between 1895 and 1907. They were a nursery club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] during part of this period. They were one of the founder members of the [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] in 1894\u201395, and they won the championship in 1901\u201302. Other honours included Southern Suburban League champions in 1898\u201399, West Kent League champions in 1903\u201304, and [[Kent Senior Cup]] runners-up in 1899\u20131900.\n\nAfter [[World War One]], Cray switched to the [[London League (football)|London League]] where they remained till 1934. In the 1930\u201331 season they won the Kent Amateur Cup. Cray rejoined the Kent League in 1934\u201335, but their four-year stay came to grief when 1936 saw the loss of the Fordcroft ground in Cray Avenue, their home since 1898. Cray were forced to drop into a lower level of football, drifting from one temporary pitch to another while the club committee dwindled to a perilously small number. The team struggled badly in the South London Alliance and the Kent Amateur League.\n\n1951/52 heralded a new era, and an upturn in the club's fortunes, when local businessman Mick Slater took over at the helm. The club was elected to the London League and regained its senior status. Cray moved to a new ground at Grassmeade in 1955. Their stay there was a very successful period in the club's history. Drawing extra support from the commuter town of [[Orpington]], they played in the London League and then the [[Aetolian League]]. They were three times crowned champions, won the League Cup twice, and also won the Kent Amateur Cup three times.\n\nCray switched to the semi-professional [[Metropolitan League]] for five seasons commencing in 1966\u201367. In 1971\u201372 the [[Metropolitan London League|Met London League]] was created by a merger of the Metropolitan League and the [[Greater London League]].\n   \nCray moved to Oxford Road in 1973\u201374. Johnny Biddle and Jimmy Wakeling proved to be successful managers. In 1974/75 Cray won the Met London League and League Cup, scoring 170 goals in all matches that season. In 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 Cray won the [[London Spartan League]] championship.\n\nCray decided to return to the Kent League in 1978\u201379. Success came quickly because Cray won the championship in 1980/81, having been runners-up the year before. Their powerful new team under manager Harry Richardson reached the [[FA Vase]] quarter-final and 5th round in those two seasons. After that, the 1980s decade brought only one more piece of silverware, the Kent League Cup in 1983\u201384. After finishing Kent League runners up in 1990/91, Cray had a lean period during most of the 1990s, with the exception of 1992\u201393 when they won the Kent Senior Trophy.\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers FC Kent League champions 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Kent League champions in 1981.]]\n\nA new club chairman Gary Hillman arrived in 1994/95 and Ian Jenkins, a Cray player since 1993, was appointed manager in 1999. By now, Cray were tenants of [[Bromley F.C.]]. As champions of the Kent League in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, also reaching the FA Vase quarter-final, they achieved promotion into the Isthmian League Division One.\n\nIn the [[Isthmian League 2007-08|2007\u201308]] season Cray reached the play-off final after finishing 3rd in the table, but lost to [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]] 1\u20130 at [[Imperial Fields]].

The team was relegated into the Isthmian League Division One North at the end of April 2014. Gary Abbott and Mike Paye became joint managers of the team at the start of October 2014. On 5 January 2015 the club appointed Tommy Warrilow as the new manager. Warrilow masterminded a dramatic \"Great Escape\" from a second successive relegation as the team won their last ten games of the season.\n\nFormer player Tony Russell took over for the [[2015-16 Isthmian League|2015\u201316]] season, guiding the team to fourth place in Division One North. Cray therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs but lost to [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Two years later, they reached the play-offs again, this time after finishing 3rd in Division One South, but lost 5\u20132 to [[Walton Casuals F.C.|Walton Casuals]].

After playing at numerous other grounds, Cray played at Grassmeade from 1954 to 1973, after which they moved to Oxford Road.  Unfortunately for the club, in 1998 the Kent League ruled that clubs must have floodlighting.  As Cray were unable to have lights installed, they were forced to move out and share the Hayes Lane ground of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], although their reserve and youth teams continued to play at the former ground until 2011, when it was taken over by [[Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C.|Seven Acre Sports & Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Club History (brief)| publisher = Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C. | url = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/sportingclubthamesmeadfc/a/a-brief-history-of-sporting-club-thamesmead-fc-31729.html | accessdate = 2016-11-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.]]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Cray announced plans to move to a new stadium near Orpington by 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chairman has grounds for optimism ahead of play-offs |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=28 April 2008 |url=http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013001/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenkins faces Cup Final selection dilemma |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013006/http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Official plans published on the club's official website on 18 February 2009 confirmed that the new ground at Sandy Lane would be open by 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season, subject to planning consent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cray Stop Wandering After 40 Years! |publisher=Official Website |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |accessdate=2009-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074138/http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref>  The stadium, which is proposed to be part of a new \"Sports Village-like complex\" is set to be eco-friendly and be built to an initial [[Football Conference|Conference]] standard.\n\nThe bid was rejected unanimously, by all councillors on Bromley Council's Development Control Committee on Thursday 20 September 2012. This was for a number of reasons, but mainly because the Club was hoping to build a Football League sized stadium, using the profits from building nearly 200 houses and a large hotel on Green Belt land.\n\nIn the debate on the application, which was opposed by the Police and the GLA as well as other bodies, it was clear that Councillors were supportative of a proposal to relocate Cray Wanderers to a new home in St. Pauls Cray, but not to the building of houses, a hotel and another swimming pool, given that LA Leisure already have a swimming pool opposite the site, in order to fund it.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre in St Paul\u2019s Cray on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club had an 18-month period to obtain planning consent from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 1,300.

Several other players have made first team appearances during the first season.\n\nIt was decided at the beginning of 2016 that this arrangement with Coopers School would come to an end.

Based on later reports, the club has a claim to have been established some time in 1860 in the twin villages of [[St. Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]], near [[Orpington]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vain Games of No Value by Terry Morris | publisher = Author House| date = 2016 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GrfCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT122&lpg=PT122&dq=Cray+Wanderers+1860&source=bl&ots=6YFc0q4QOr&sig=vX_cTjNOLwV-y_5PxSe0B5S7eiI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT-fifn8XMAhWE6xQKHeqGAGM4HhDoAQhNMAg#v=onepage&q=Cray%20Wanderers%201860&f=false | accessdate = 15 September 2016}}</ref> Such a date would make it one of the [[oldest football club]]s in the world.\n\nThey currently play their home matches at [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s [[Hayes Lane]] ground (capacity 5,000). Cray Wanderers were [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] champions four times, and have reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]] once in their history. They are currently members of the {{English football updater|CrayWand}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first origins of Cray Wanderers are linked to the construction of the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] line during 1858 to 1860.<ref name=\"OHist\"/> During their leisure time, migrant workers kicked a ball around, and that is how the club originated in the [[St Mary Cray]] village. The pitch at Star Lane is now a cemetery, and is located beneath the nine-arch railway viaduct that spans the Cray Valley. The industrial belt of the [[River Cray]], especially the paper mills, provided much of the club's support up till the 1950s.\n   \nCray Wanderers were a strong force in senior county football at the turn of the century. After being Kent Junior Cup semi-finalists and finalists in 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 they entered the first ever [[FA Amateur Cup]] competition in 1893\u201394. They had a spell as a professional club between 1895 and 1907. They were a nursery club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] during part of this period. They were one of the founder members of the [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] in 1894\u201395, and they won the championship in 1901\u201302. Other honours included Southern Suburban League champions in 1898\u201399, West Kent League champions in 1903\u201304, and [[Kent Senior Cup]] runners-up in 1899\u20131900.\n\nAfter [[World War One]], Cray switched to the [[London League (football)|London League]] where they remained till 1934. In the 1930\u201331 season they won the Kent Amateur Cup. Cray rejoined the Kent League in 1934\u201335, but their four-year stay came to grief when 1936 saw the loss of the Fordcroft ground in Cray Avenue, their home since 1898. Cray were forced to drop into a lower level of football, drifting from one temporary pitch to another while the club committee dwindled to a perilously small number. The team struggled badly in the South London Alliance and the Kent Amateur League.\n\n1951/52 heralded a new era, and an upturn in the club's fortunes, when local businessman Mick Slater took over at the helm. The club was elected to the London League and regained its senior status. Cray moved to a new ground at Grassmeade in 1955. Their stay there was a very successful period in the club's history. Drawing extra support from the commuter town of [[Orpington]], they played in the London League and then the [[Aetolian League]]. They were three times crowned champions, won the League Cup twice, and also won the Kent Amateur Cup three times.\n\nCray switched to the semi-professional [[Metropolitan League]] for five seasons commencing in 1966\u201367. In 1971\u201372 the [[Metropolitan London League|Met London League]] was created by a merger of the Metropolitan League and the [[Greater London League]].\n   \nCray moved to Oxford Road in 1973\u201374. Johnny Biddle and Jimmy Wakeling proved to be successful managers. In 1974/75 Cray won the Met London League and League Cup, scoring 170 goals in all matches that season. In 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 Cray won the [[London Spartan League]] championship.\n\nCray decided to return to the Kent League in 1978\u201379. Success came quickly because Cray won the championship in 1980/81, having been runners-up the year before. Their powerful new team under manager Harry Richardson reached the [[FA Vase]] quarter-final and 5th round in those two seasons. After that, the 1980s decade brought only one more piece of silverware, the Kent League Cup in 1983\u201384. After finishing Kent League runners up in 1990/91, Cray had a lean period during most of the 1990s, with the exception of 1992\u201393 when they won the Kent Senior Trophy.\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers FC Kent League champions 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Kent League champions in 1981.]]\n\nA new club chairman Gary Hillman arrived in 1994/95 and Ian Jenkins, a Cray player since 1993, was appointed manager in 1999. By now, Cray were tenants of [[Bromley F.C.]]. As champions of the Kent League in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, also reaching the FA Vase quarter-final, they achieved promotion into the Isthmian League Division One.\n\nIn the [[Isthmian League 2007-08|2007\u201308]] season Cray reached the play-off final after finishing 3rd in the table, but lost to [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]] 1\u20130 at [[Imperial Fields]]. They also reached the [[Kent Senior Cup]] final, played at Hayes Lane on 26 July, where they lost to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web | title = Match Report: Cray Wanderers 0 Ebbsfleet United 4 | publisher = Official Website | date = | url = http://www.craywands.co.uk/cray0ebbsfleet4.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Cray again reached the play-off final the following year, in which they beat [[Metropolitan Police F.C.|Metropolitan Police]] 1\u20130 and were promoted to the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]].\n\nCray Wanderers celebrated their 150th anniversary during the summer of 2010, including friendlies against the other two oldest clubs in the world, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]] and [[Hallam F.C.|Hallam]], in a three-team tournament.\n\nIan Jenkins, who had managed the club for 14 years, left in September 2013.<ref>[http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 Kentishfootball.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140419/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 |date=2 October 2013 }}</ref> Keith Bird and [[Mick Paye|Mike Paye]], managers of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s reserve team, were appointed as manager and assistant manager respectively. The team was relegated into the Isthmian League Division One North at the end of April 2014. Gary Abbott and Mike Paye became joint managers of the team at the start of October 2014. On 5 January 2015 the club appointed Tommy Warrilow as the new manager. Warrilow masterminded a dramatic \"Great Escape\" from a second successive relegation as the team won their last ten games of the season.\n\nFormer player Tony Russell took over for the [[2015-16 Isthmian League|2015\u201316]] season, guiding the team to fourth place in Division One North. Cray therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs but lost to [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Two years later, they reached the play-offs again, this time after finishing 3rd in Division One South, but lost 5\u20132 to [[Walton Casuals F.C.|Walton Casuals]].

After playing at numerous other grounds, Cray played at Grassmeade from 1954 to 1973, after which they moved to Oxford Road.  Unfortunately for the club, in 1998 the Kent League ruled that clubs must have floodlighting.  As Cray were unable to have lights installed, they were forced to move out and share the Hayes Lane ground of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], although their reserve and youth teams continued to play at the former ground until 2011, when it was taken over by [[Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C.|Seven Acre Sports & Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Club History (brief)| publisher = Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C. | url = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/sportingclubthamesmeadfc/a/a-brief-history-of-sporting-club-thamesmead-fc-31729.html | accessdate = 2016-11-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.]]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Cray announced plans to move to a new stadium near Orpington by 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chairman has grounds for optimism ahead of play-offs |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=28 April 2008 |url=http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013001/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenkins faces Cup Final selection dilemma |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013006/http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Official plans published on the club's official website on 18 February 2009 confirmed that the new ground at Sandy Lane would be open by 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season, subject to planning consent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cray Stop Wandering After 40 Years! |publisher=Official Website |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |accessdate=2009-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074138/http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref>  The stadium, which is proposed to be part of a new \"Sports Village-like complex\" is set to be eco-friendly and be built to an initial [[Football Conference|Conference]] standard.\n\nThe bid was rejected unanimously, by all councillors on Bromley Council's Development Control Committee on Thursday 20 September 2012. This was for a number of reasons, but mainly because the Club was hoping to build a Football League sized stadium, using the profits from building nearly 200 houses and a large hotel on Green Belt land.\n\nIn the debate on the application, which was opposed by the Police and the GLA as well as other bodies, it was clear that Councillors were supportative of a proposal to relocate Cray Wanderers to a new home in St. Pauls Cray, but not to the building of houses, a hotel and another swimming pool, given that LA Leisure already have a swimming pool opposite the site, in order to fund it.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre in St Paul\u2019s Cray on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club had an 18-month period to obtain planning consent from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 1,300. This was achieved in April 2016, when the Council approved the proposal.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bromley Council approve planning permission for Flamingo Park | publisher = Official website | date = 19 April 2016 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/bromley-council-approve-planning-approval/  | accessdate = 2016-04-30}}</ref> There was disappointment when the application was later refused by the [[Mayor of London]] and a revised set of plans were being prepared in 2017.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stadium updates | publisher = Official website | date = 13 April 2017 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/stadium-updates/  | accessdate = 2017-05-17}}</ref>.

Several other players have made first team appearances during the first season.\n\nIt was decided at the beginning of 2016 that this arrangement with Coopers School would come to an end. The club are looking at establishing another Academy setup in the next couple of years.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Isthmian League]] Division One\n**Winners (South East): [[2018\u201319 Isthmian League|2018\u201319]]\n**Runners-up (South): [[2008-09 Isthmian League|2008\u201309]]\n**Play-off Winners (South): [[2008-09 Isthmian League|2008\u201309]]\n*[[Kent Football League|Kent League]]: 1901\u201302, 1980\u201381, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304\n**Runners Up: 1979\u201380, 1990\u201391\n*[[London League (football)|London League]]: 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358\n**Runners Up: 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355\n*[[Aetolian League (football)|Aetolian League]]: 1962\u201363\n*[[Greater London League]]: 1965-66\n*[[Metropolitan-London League]]: 1974-75\n*[[London Spartan League]]: 1976\u201377, 1977\u201378\n*[[Kent Senior Trophy]]: 1992-92, 2003\u201304\n*[[Kent Amateur Cup]]: 1930\u201331, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1964\u201365\n*Best league performance: 9th in [[Isthmian League Premier Division]], [[2010\u201311 Isthmian League|2010\u201311]], [[2011\u201312 Isthmian League|2011\u201312]]\n*Best [[FA Cup]] performance: 4th qualifying round, 2005\u201306\n*Best [[FA Trophy]] performance: 2nd round (equivalent of current 3rd qualifying round), 2004\u201305. 3rd qualifying round, 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008\u201309, 2012\u201313, 2014\u201315, 2017\u201318\n*Best [[FA Vase]] performance: Quarter-finals, 1979\u201380, 2003\u201304<ref>{{fchd|name=Cray Wanderers|id=CRAYW}}</ref>\n*Best [[Kent Senior Cup]] performance: Final, 1900\u201301, 2007\u201308\n\n==Current squad==\n<ref>[https://www.cray-wanderers.com/teams/first-team/ First team] Cray Wanderers F.C.</ref>\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Lewis Carey}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Grant Hall}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Tom Carlse}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Jay Leader}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Mitchell Nelson}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Geofrey Okwonko}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Joe Vines|other=player-assistant manager}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Barney Williams}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Charlie Allen (footballer)|Charlie Allen]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Karl Dent}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Charles Etumnu}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Jerome Federico]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Lee Lewis}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Ben Mundele}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Tom Phipp}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ZIM|pos=MF|name=[[Bradley Pritchard]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Aaron Rhule}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=AUS|pos=MF|name=[[Joel Rollinson]]|other=on loan from [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=[[Tom Murphy (English footballer)|Tom Murphy]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Joe Taylor}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Freddie Parker}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Rhys Murrell-Williamson}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Club staff==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Name\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Club Management'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Manager\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Tony Russell\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Player-Assistant Manager\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Joe Vines\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Coach\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Nathan White\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Goalkeeping Coach\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Grant Hall\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Physio\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Ally Maloney\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Board'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Chairman\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Gary Hillman\n|-\n|}\n\n==Records==\n*Record attendance: 2160 vs [[Leytonstone F.C.|Leytonstone]] ([[FA Amateur Cup]], 1969)\n*Biggest Win: 15\u20130 vs [[Sevenoaks Town F.C.|Sevenoaks]], 1894\u201395\n*Biggest Defeat: 1\u201311 vs [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], 1920\u201321\n*Biggest [[Isthmian League]] Win: 9\u20131 vs, [[Ashford United]]  2017\u201318 \n*Biggest [[Isthmian League]] Defeat: 3\u20139 vs Kingstonian, 2012\u201313\n\n===Player records===\n*Most appearances: John Dorey, 454 (1961\u201372), Jamie Wood, 461 (including some as non-playing sub) (1996-2010)\n*Most goals: Ken Collishaw, 274 (1954\u201365)\n\n==Managerial history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n \n|-\n!

The Cyrillic script is used in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. An October 2017 Presidential Decree in Kazakhstan ordered that the transition from Cyrillic to a Latin script be completed by 2025.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/kazakhstan-to-change-from-cyrillic-to-latin-alphabet/a-41147396 Kazakhstan will start change from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet in 2018]</ref> The Arabic script is used in parts of China, Iran and Afghanistan.\n\n==Cyrillic script==\n\nThe Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet is used in Kazakhstan and the [[Bayan-\u00d6lgiy Province]] in Mongolia. It is also used by Kazakh populations in Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, as well as diasporas in other countries of the former USSR. It was introduced during the [[Russian Empire]] period in the 1800s, and then adapted by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940.<ref name = April2017change>{{cite news|url = https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-president-orders-shift-from-cyrillic/28425590.html|title = Kazakh President Orders Shift Away From Cyrillic Alphabet|work = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=April 12, 2017|accessdate=October 30, 2017|url-status = live|archive-date = July 6, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170706223651/https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-president-orders-shift-from-cyrillic/28425590.html}}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, [[Ibrahim Altynsarin]], a prominent Kazakh educator, first introduced a Cyrillic alphabet for transcribing Kazakh. Russian missionary activity, as well as Russian-sponsored schools, further encouraged the use of Cyrillic in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The alphabet was reworked by [[Sarsen Amanzholov]] and accepted in its current form in 1940. It contains 42 letters: 33 from the Russian alphabet with 9 additional letters for sounds of the Kazakh language: \u04d8, \u0492, \u049a, \u04a2, \u04e8, \u04b0, \u04ae, \u04ba, \u0406 (until 1957 ''\u04ee'' was used instead of ''\u04b0''). Initially, Kazakh letters came after letters from the Russian alphabet, but now they are placed after Russian letters similar in sound or shape.\n\nThe letters \u0412, \u0401 (since 1957), \u0424, \u0425, \u0426, \u0427, \u0429, \u042a, \u042c and \u042d are not used in native Kazakh words. Of these, \u0401, \u0426, \u0427, \u0429, \u042a, \u042c, \u042d, are used only in words borrowed from Russian or through the Russian language which are written according to Russian orthographic rules. The letter \u0425 in conversational speech is pronounced similar to \u049a. The letter \u04ba is used only in Arabic-Persian borrowings and is often pronounced like an unvoiced \u0425 (as {{IPA|/h/}}, or a [[voiceless glottal fricative]]).\n\nThe letter \u0418 represents the tense vowel {{IPA|[i]}} obtained from the combinations \u042b\u0419 {{IPA|/\u0259j/}} and \u0406\u0419 {{IPA|/\u026aj/}}. The letter \u0423 represents {{IPA|/w/}} and the tense vowel {{IPA|[u]}} obtained from the combinations \u04b0\u0423 {{IPA|/\u028aw/}}, \u04ae\u0423 {{IPA|/\u0289w/}}, \u042b\u0423 {{IPA|/\u0259w/}} and \u0406\u0423 {{IPA|/\u026aw/}}. Additionally, \u0418 and \u0423 are retained in words borrowed from Russian, where they represent the simple vowels {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} respectively.\n\n=== History ===\n{{see also|Russification#Under the Soviet Union}}\nThe switch from a Latin alphabet to a Cyrillic one was likely in an attempt to distance the then-Soviet Kazakhstan from Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was likely in part due to weakening Turkish-Soviet relations and the [[Turkish Straits crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn effort to consolidate its national identity, Kazakhstan started a phased transition from the Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin alphabet in 2017. The Kazakh government drafted a seven-year process until the full implementation of the new alphabet, sub-divided into various phases.<ref name=\"Alph11\">{{cite web |title=Switching to Latin alphabet further opens Kazakhstan to the world |url=https://astanatimes.com/2018/03/switching-to-latin-alphabet-further-opens-kazakhstan-to-the-world/ |website=astanatimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Encoding===\nBefore the spread of operating systems and text editors with support for [[Unicode]], Cyrillic Kazakh often failed to fit on a keyboard because of both the problem with 8-bit encoding, which was not supported at the system level, and the absence of standard computer fonts. More than 20 variations of 8-bit encoding for Kazakh Cyrillic have been suggested, including the following government standards (note that the following are historical code pages and that modern systems use Unicode Encoding, such as UTF-8):\n* \u0421\u0422 \u0420\u041a 920-91 for DOS (a modification of [[code page]] 866)\n* \u0421\u0422 \u0420\u041a 1048\u20142002 for Windows (a modification of code page 1251)\n\u0421\u0422 \u0420\u041a 1048\u20142002 was confirmed in 2002, well after the introduction of different Windows character sets. Some Internet resources in part used the government information agency QazAqparat before the encoding of this standard. Today the encoding UTF-8 is being accepted.\n\n===Keyboard===\nThe standard Windows [[keyboard layout]] used for Cyrillic Kazakh in Kazakhstan is a modification of the standard Russian keyboard, with characters found in Kazakh but not in Russian located on the number keys.\n[[File:Keyboard KAZ.png|none|400 px|thumb|The Kazakh keyboard.]]\n\n==Latin script==\n{{See also|Russification#Kazakhstan and De-russification}}[[File: Sotsijaldy qazaqstan.jpg|right|thumb|A Kazakh newspaper ''Socialist Kazakhstan'' (Sos\u0131\u0131aldy Qaza\u01f5stan) in Latin script (1937)]]A number of Latin alphabets are in use to write the Kazakh language.

It was first introduced to the territory of Kazakhstan in the eleventh century, and was traditionally used to write Kazakh until the introduction of a Latin alphabet in 1929. In 1924, Kazakh intellectual [[Akhmet Baitursynov]] attempted to reform the Arabic script to better suit Kazakh. The letters {{Script/Arabic|[[\u06c6]]}}, {{Script/Arabic|[[\u06af]]}}, {{Script/Arabic|[[\u06ad]]}}, {{Script/Arabic|[[\u067e]]}} and {{Script/Arabic|[[\u0686]]}} are used to represent sounds not found in the [[Arabic language]].\n\nA modified Arabic script is also used in Iran and Afghanistan, based on the alphabet used for Kazakh before 1929.\n\nThe Kazakh Arabic alphabet contains 29 letters and one digit, the 'upper hamza' used at the beginnings of words to create [[front vowel]]s throughout the word. The direction the alphabet is written in is right to left. Unlike the original Arabic script, which is an [[abjad]], the Kazakh Arabic script functions more like a true alphabet, as each sound has its own letter and every sound in each word is spelt out in the written form of the language. The reform of the Arabic script from an abjad to an alphabet was carried out by the early 20th-century linguist [[Akhmet Baitursynov]].\n\n=== Forms of the Kazakh Arabic alphabet ===\n\n{|

===\nOrkhon-Yenisey Runes have a superficial similarity to Germanic [[Runes]] in shape. Unlike the Germanic runes, [[Old Turkic alphabet]] runes are read right to left as opposed to the Germanic runes that are read left to right. The script was used in some parts of Kazakhstan's territory in the fifth to the tenth centuries. The language of the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]], the language of the [[Turkic Khaganate]].\n\n=== Kipchak Armenian ===\nMigrating from the Armenian kingdom in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Armenians had an extensive liturgical, legal and other literature in the Kipchak language that differs from Old Kazakh only by the abundance of the Armenian-Christian vocabulary. These texts were written using the Armenian alphabet. Their descendants who settled around the world, almost to the end of the nineteenth century, the Armenian-Kipchak were writing business records, personal correspondence and more.\n\n=== Latin Kipchak ===\nCatholic missionaries in Crimea produced holy books in the Kipchak language, the ancestor of the Kazakh language, they produced the Gospel and the other liturgical books.\n\n=== Other writing systems ===\n\nThere are epigraphic monuments of Turkic tribes (mainly to the period of Islamization).\n\nFor sight-impaired people, there is also [[Kazakh Braille]], based on [[Russian Braille]], with several additional letters found in the Kazakh alphabet.\n\n==Text sample==\nArticle 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:<ref>{{cite book|title = Universal Declaration of Human Rights|edition = Kazakh|via = [[Wikisource]]|title-link = oldwikisource:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c \u049b\u04b1\u049b\u044b\u049b\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044b\u04a3 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043f\u044b\u0493\u0430 \u0431\u0456\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;width:100%\"\n!

The Cyrillic script is used in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. An October 2017 Presidential Decree in Kazakhstan ordered that the transition from Cyrillic to a Latin script be completed by 2025.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/kazakhstan-to-change-from-cyrillic-to-latin-alphabet/a-41147396 Kazakhstan will start change from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet in 2018]</ref> The Arabic script is used in parts of China, Iran and Afghanistan.\n\n==Cyrillic script==\n\nThe Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet is used in Kazakhstan and the [[Bayan-\u00d6lgiy Province]] in Mongolia. It is also used by Kazakh populations in Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, as well as diasporas in other countries of the former USSR. It was introduced during the [[Russian Empire]] period in the 1800s, and then adapted by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940.<ref name = April2017change>{{cite news|url = https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-president-orders-shift-from-cyrillic/28425590.html|title = Kazakh President Orders Shift Away From Cyrillic Alphabet|work = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=April 12, 2017|accessdate=October 30, 2017|url-status = live|archive-date = July 6, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170706223651/https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-president-orders-shift-from-cyrillic/28425590.html}}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, [[Ibrahim Altynsarin]], a prominent Kazakh educator, first introduced a Cyrillic alphabet for transcribing Kazakh. Russian missionary activity, as well as Russian-sponsored schools, further encouraged the use of Cyrillic in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The alphabet was reworked by [[Sarsen Amanzholov]] and accepted in its current form in 1940. It contains 42 letters: 33 from the Russian alphabet with 9 additional letters for sounds of the Kazakh language: \u04d8, \u0492, \u049a, \u04a2, \u04e8, \u04b0, \u04ae, \u04ba, \u0406 (until 1957 ''\u04ee'' was used instead of ''\u04b0''). Initially, Kazakh letters came after letters from the Russian alphabet, but now they are placed after Russian letters similar in sound or shape.\n\nThe letters \u0412, \u0401 (since 1957), \u0424, \u0425, \u0426, \u0427, \u0429, \u042a, \u042c and \u042d are not used in native Kazakh words. Of these, \u0401, \u0426, \u0427, \u0429, \u042a, \u042c, \u042d, are used only in words borrowed from Russian or through the Russian language which are written according to Russian orthographic rules. The letter \u0425 in conversational speech is pronounced similar to \u049a. The letter \u04ba is used only in Arabic-Persian borrowings and is often pronounced like an unvoiced \u0425 (as {{IPA|/h/}}, or a [[voiceless glottal fricative]]).\n\nThe letter \u0418 represents the tense vowel {{IPA|[i]}} obtained from the combinations \u042b\u0419 {{IPA|/\u0259j/}} and \u0406\u0419 {{IPA|/\u026aj/}}. The letter \u0423 represents {{IPA|/w/}} and the tense vowel {{IPA|[u]}} obtained from the combinations \u04b0\u0423 {{IPA|/\u028aw/}}, \u04ae\u0423 {{IPA|/\u0289w/}}, \u042b\u0423 {{IPA|/\u0259w/}} and \u0406\u0423 {{IPA|/\u026aw/}}. Additionally, \u0418 and \u0423 are retained in words borrowed from Russian, where they represent the simple vowels {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} respectively.\n\n=== History ===\n{{see also|Russification#Under the Soviet Union}}\nThe switch from a Latin alphabet to a Cyrillic one was likely in an attempt to distance the then-Soviet Kazakhstan from Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was likely in part due to weakening Turkish-Soviet relations and the [[Turkish Straits crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn effort to consolidate its national identity, Kazakhstan started a phased transition from the Cyrillic alphabet to Latin in 2017. The Kazakh government drafted a seven-year process until the full implementation of the new alphabet, sub-divided into various phases.<ref name=\"Alph11\">{{cite web |title=Switching to Latin alphabet further opens Kazakhstan to the world |url=https://astanatimes.com/2018/03/switching-to-latin-alphabet-further-opens-kazakhstan-to-the-world/ |website=astanatimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Encoding===\nBefore the spread of operating systems and text editors with support for [[Unicode]], Cyrillic Kazakh often failed to fit on a keyboard because of both the problem with 8-bit encoding, which was not supported at the system level, and the absence of standard computer fonts. More than 20 variations of 8-bit encoding for Kazakh Cyrillic have been suggested, including the following government standards (note that the following are historical code pages and that modern systems use Unicode Encoding, such as UTF-8):\n* \u0421\u0422 \u0420\u041a 920-91 for DOS (a modification of [[code page]] 866)\n* \u0421\u0422 \u0420\u041a 1048\u20142002 for Windows (a modification of code page 1251)\n\u0421\u0422 \u0420\u041a 1048\u20142002 was confirmed in 2002, well after the introduction of different Windows character sets. Some Internet resources in part used the government information agency QazAqparat before the encoding of this standard. Today the encoding UTF-8 is being accepted.\n\n===Keyboard===\nThe standard Windows [[keyboard layout]] used for Cyrillic Kazakh in Kazakhstan is a modification of the standard Russian keyboard, with characters found in Kazakh but not in Russian located on the number keys.\n[[File:Keyboard KAZ.png|none|400 px|thumb|The Kazakh keyboard.]]\n\n==Latin script==\n{{See also|Russification#Kazakhstan and De-russification}}[[File: Sotsijaldy qazaqstan.jpg|right|thumb|A Kazakh newspaper ''Socialist Kazakhstan'' (Sos\u0131\u0131aldy Qaza\u01f5stan) in Latin script (1937)]]A number of Latin alphabets are in use to write the Kazakh language.

It was first introduced to the territory of Kazakhstan in the eleventh century, and was traditionally used to write Kazakh until the introduction of a Latin alphabet in 1929. In 1924, Kazakh intellectual [[Akhmet Baitursynov]] attempted to reform the Arabic script to better suit Kazakh. The letters {{Script/Arabic|[[\u06c6]]}}, {{Script/Arabic|[[\u06af]]}}, {{Script/Arabic|[[\u06ad]]}}, {{Script/Arabic|[[\u067e]]}} and {{Script/Arabic|[[\u0686]]}} are used to represent sounds not found in the [[Arabic language]].\n\nA modified Arabic script is also used in Iran and Afghanistan, based on the alphabet used for Kazakh before 1929.\n\nThe Kazakh Arabic alphabet contains 29 letters and one digit, the 'upper hamza' used at the beginnings of words to create [[front vowel]]s throughout the word. The direction the alphabet is written in is right to left. Unlike the original Arabic script, which is an [[abjad]], the Kazakh Arabic script functions more like a true alphabet, as each sound has its own letter and every sound in each word is spelt out in the written form of the language. The reform of the Arabic script from an abjad to an alphabet was carried out by the early 20th-century linguist [[Akhmet Baitursynov]].\n\n=== Forms of the Kazakh Arabic alphabet ===\n\n{|

===\nOrkhon-Yenisey Runes have a superficial similarity to Germanic [[Runes]] in shape. Unlike the Germanic runes, [[Old Turkic alphabet]] runes are read right to left as opposed to the Germanic runes that are read left to right. The script was used in some parts of Kazakhstan's territory in the fifth to the tenth centuries. The language of the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]], the language of the [[Turkic Khaganate]].\n\n=== Kipchak Armenian ===\nMigrating from the Armenian kingdom in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Armenians had an extensive liturgical, legal and other literature in the Kipchak language that differs from Old Kazakh only by the abundance of the Armenian-Christian vocabulary. These texts were written using the Armenian alphabet. Their descendants who settled around the world, almost to the end of the nineteenth century, the Armenian-Kipchak were writing business records, personal correspondence and more.\n\n=== Latin Kipchak ===\nCatholic missionaries in Crimea produced holy books in the Kipchak language, the ancestor of the Kazakh language, they produced the Gospel and the other liturgical books.\n\n=== Other writing systems ===\n\nThere are epigraphic monuments of Turkic tribes (mainly to the period of Islamization).\n\nFor sight-impaired people, there is also [[Kazakh Braille]], based on [[Russian Braille]], with several additional letters found in the Kazakh alphabet.\n\n==Text sample==\nArticle 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:<ref>{{cite book|title = Universal Declaration of Human Rights|edition = Kazakh|via = [[Wikisource]]|title-link = oldwikisource:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c \u049b\u04b1\u049b\u044b\u049b\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044b\u04a3 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043f\u044b\u0493\u0430 \u0431\u0456\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;width:100%\"\n!
