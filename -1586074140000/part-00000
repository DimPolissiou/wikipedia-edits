First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

Targitaus allegedly lived a thousand years before the failed Persian invasion of [[Scythia]], or around 1500 BC. He had three sons, before whom fell from the sky a set of four golden implements \u2013 a plough, a yoke, a cup, and a battle-axe. Only the youngest son succeeded in touching the golden implements without them bursting with fire, and this son's descendants, called by Herodotus the \"Royal Scythians\", continued to guard them.\n# Secondly (4.8), a legend told by the [[Pontic Greeks]] featuring Scythes, the first king of the Scythians, as a child of [[Hercules]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]].\n# Thirdly (4.11), in the version which Herodotus said he believed most, the Scythians came from a more southern part of [[Central Asia]], until a war with the Massagetae (a powerful tribe of steppe nomads who lived just northeast of [[Persia]]) forced them westward.\n# Finally (4.13), a legend which Herodotus attributed to the Greek bard [[Aristeas]], who claimed to have got himself into such a Bacchanalian fury that he ran all the way northeast across Scythia and further. According to this, the Scythians originally lived south of the [[Urals|Rhipaean mountains]], until they got into a conflict with a tribe called the [[Issedones]], pressed in their turn by the \"one-eyed [[Arimaspi]]ans\"; and so the Scythians decided to migrate westwards.\n\nAccounts by Herodotus of Scythian origins has been discounted recently; although his accounts of Scythian raiding activities contemporary to his writings have been deemed more reliable.<ref>{{harvnb|Drews|2004|p=92}} \"Ever since critical history began, scholars have recognized that much of what Herodotos gives us is silly.\"</ref>\n\n====Archaeological evidence====\n[[File:Scythian cultures.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Distribution of the [[Scythian cultures]], of which the Scythians were part]]\nModern interpretation of historical, archaeological, and anthropological evidence has proposed two broad hypotheses on Scythian origins.<ref name=\"M_51\"/>\n\nThe first hypothesis, formerly more espoused by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and then [[Russia]]n researchers, roughly followed Herodotus' (third) account, holding that the Scythians were an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]-speaking group who arrived from [[Inner Asia]], i.e. from the area of [[Turkestan]] and western Siberia.\n<ref name=\"M_51\">{{harvnb|Mallory|1991|pp=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe second hypothesis, according to [[Roman Ghirshman]] and others, proposes that the Scythian cultural complex emerged from local groups of the [[Srubna culture]] at the Black Sea coast,<ref name=\"M_51\"/> although this is also associated with the Cimmerians. According to [[Pavel Dolukhanov]] this proposal is supported by anthropological evidence which has found that Scythian skulls are similar to preceding findings from the Srubna culture, and distinct from those of the Central Asian Saka.<ref>{{harvnb|Dolukhanov|1996|p=125}}</ref> Yet, according to [[J.

He classes the Cimmerians as a distinct [[autochthon (person)|autochthonous]] tribe, expelled by the Scythians from the northern Black Sea coast (''Hist.'' 4.11\u201312). Herodotus also states (4.6) that the Scythians consisted of the [[Auchatae]], [[Catiaroi]], [[Traspians]], and [[Paralatae]] or \"Royal Scythians\".\n\nIn the early 7th century BC, the Scythians and Cimmerians are recorded in Assyrian texts as having conquered [[Urartu]]. In the 670s, the Scythians under their king [[Bartatua]] raided the territories of the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]] managed to make peace with the Scythians by paying a large amount of tribute.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Bartatua was succeeded by his son [[Madius]] ca. 645 BC, after which they launched a great raid on [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Madius subsequently subjugated the [[Median Empire]]. During this time, Herodotus notes that the Scythians raided and exacted tribute from \"the whole of Asia\". In the 620s, [[Cyaxares]], leader of the [[Medes]], treacherously killed a large number of Scythian chieftains at a feast; the Scythians were subsequently driven back to the steppe. In 612 BC, the Medes and Scythians participated in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire with the [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Battle of Nineveh]].

Relations between the Greeks and the Scythians appear to have been peaceful, with the Scythians being substantially influenced by the Greeks, although the city of the [[Panticapaeum]] might have been destroyed by the Scythians in the mid century BC.

Planning an invasion of Greece, Darius first sought to secure his northern flank against Scythian inroads. Thus, Darius [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|declared war on the Scythians]].<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> At first, Darius sent his [[Cappadocia]]n satrap [[Ariamnes]] with a vast fleet (estimated at 600 ships by Herodotus) into Scythian territory, where several Scythian nobles were captured. He then built a bridge across the [[Bosporus]] and easily defeated the [[Thracians]], crossing the [[Danube]] into Scythian territory with a large army (700,000 men if one is to believe Herodotus) in 512 BC.<ref name=\"Cernenko_21\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=21\u201329}}</ref> At this time Scythians were separated into three major kingdoms, with the leader of the largest tribe, King [[Idanthyrsus]], being the supreme ruler, and his subordinate kings being [[Scopasis]] and [[Taxacis]].\n\nUnable to receive support from neighboring nomadic peoples against the Persians, the Scythians evacuated their civilians and livestock to the north and adopted a [[scorched earth]] strategy, while simultaneously harassing the extensive Persian supply lines. Suffering heavy losses, the Persians reached as far as the [[Sea of Azov]], until Darius was compelled to enter into negotiations with Idanthyrsus, which however broke down. Darius and his army eventually retreated across the Danube back into Persia, and the Scythians thereafter earned a reputation of invincibility among neighboring peoples.<ref name=\"Cernenko_21\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Golden Age===\nIn the aftermath of their defeat of the Persian invasion, Scythian power grew considerably, and they launched campaigns against their Thracian neighbors in the west.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=29\u201332}}</ref> In 496 BC, the Scythians launched an great expedition into Thrace, reaching as far as [[Chersonesos (Thrace)|Chersonesos]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> During this time they negotiated an alliance with the Achaemenid Empire against the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes I]]. A prominent king of the Scythians in the 5th century was [[Scyles]].<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\nThe Scythian offensive against the Thracians was checked by the [[Odrysian kingdom]]. The border between the Scythians and the Odrysian kingdom was thereafter set at the Danube, and relations between the two dynasties were good, with dynastic marriages frequently occurring.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> The Scythians also expanded towards the north-west, where they destroyed numerous fortified settlements and probably subjucated numerous settled populations. A similar fate was suffered by the Greek cities of the northwestern Black Sea coast and parts of the Crimea, over which the Scythians established political control.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Greek settlements along the [[Don River]] also came under the control of the Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nA division of responsibility developed, with the Scythians holding the political and military power, the urban population carrying out trade, and the local sedentary population carrying out manual labor.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their territories grew grain, and shipped wheat, flocks, and cheese to Greece. The Scythians apparently obtained much of their wealth from their control over the [[slave trade]] from the north to Greece through the Greek [[Black Sea]] [[apoikia|colonial ports]] of [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], and [[Gorgippia]].\n\nWhen Herodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the 5th century BC, Greeks distinguished [[Scythia Minor]], in present-day [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], from a [[Scythia|Greater Scythia]] that extended eastwards for a 20-day ride from the Danube River, across the [[steppe]]s of today's East Ukraine to the lower [[Don River, Russia|Don]] basin.\n\nScythian offensives against the Greek colonies of the northeastern Black Sea coast were largely unsuccessful, as the Greeks united under the leadership of the city of Panticapaeum and put up a vigorous defence. These Greek cities developed into the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. Meanwhile, several Greek colonies formerly under Scythian control began to reassert their independence. It is possible that the Scythians were suffering from internal troubles during this time.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the mid 4th century BC, the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to the east of the Scythians, began expanding into Scythian territory.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\n[[Image:Skiluros.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scythian king [[Skilurus]], relief from [[Scythian Neapolis]], Crimea, 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC]]\n\nThe 4th century BC was a flowering of Scythian culture. The Scythian king [[Ateas]] managed to unite under his power the Scythian tribes living between the [[Maeotian Swamp|Maeotian marshes]] and the Danube, while simultaneously enroaching upon the Thracians.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> He conquered territories along the Danube as far the [[Sava]] river and established a trade route from the Black Sea to the [[Adriatic]], which enabled a flourishing of trade in the Scythian kingdom. The westward expansion of Ateas brought him into conflict with [[Philip II of Macedon]] (reigned 359 to 336 BC), with whom he had previously been allied,<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> who took military action against the Scythians in 339 BC. Ateas died in battle, and his empire disintegrated.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], continued the conflict with the Scythians. In 331 BC, his general [[Zopyrion]] invaded Scythian territory with a force of 30,000 men, but was routed and killed by the Scythians near Olbia.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the aftermath of conflict between Macedon and the Scythians, the [[Celts]] seem to have displaced the Scythians from the [[Balkans]]; while in south Russia, a kindred tribe, the Sarmatians, gradually overwhelmed them. In 310-309 BC, as noted by [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Scythians, in alliance with the Bosporan Kingdom, defeated the [[Siraces]] in a [[Battle of the River Thatis|great battle]] at the river Thatis.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/>\n\nBy the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian culture of the Pontic steppe suddenly disappears. The reasons for this are controversial, but the expansion of the Sarmatians certainly played a role. The Scythians in turn shifted their focus towards the Greek cities of the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Roman Empire 125 (cropped).png|thumb|right|The territory of the Scythae Basilaei (\"Royal Scyths\") along the north shore of the [[Black Sea]] around 125 AD.]]\n\nBy ca. 200 BC, the Scythians had largely withdrawn into the [[Crimea]]. By the time of Strabo's account (the first decades AD), the Crimean Scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower Dnieper to the Crimea, centered at [[Scythian Neapolis]] near modern [[Simferopol]]. They had become more settled and were intermingling with the local populations, in particular the [[Tauri]], and were also subjected to [[Hellenization]]. They maintained close relations with the Bosporan Kingdom, with whose dynasty they were linked by marriage. A separate Scythian territory, known as Scythia Minor, existed in modern-day [[Dobruja]], but was of little significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, the Scythian kings [[Skilurus]] and [[Palakus]] sought to exent their control over the Greek cities of north of the Black Sea. The Greek cities of Chersonesus and Olbia in turn requested the aid [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], whose general [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]] defeated their armies in battle, took their capital and annexed their territory to the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/><ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> After this time, the Scythians practically disappeared from history.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> Scythia Minor was also defeated by Mithradates.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the years after the death of Mithradates, the Scythians had transitioned to a settled way of life and were assimilating into neighboring populations. They made a resurgence in the 1st century AD and laid siege to Chersonesos, who were obliged to seek help from the [[Roman Empire]]. The Scythians were in turn defeated by Roman commander [[Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the 2nd century AD, archaeological evidence show that the Scythians had been largely assimilated by the Sarmatians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their capital city, Scythian Neapolis, was destroyed by the invading [[Goths]] in the mid-3rd century AD.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Avar\u00e1rok.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Scythian defence line 339 BC reconstruction in [[Polg\u00e1r, Hungary]] ]]\nArchaeological remains of the Scythians include [[kurgans|kurgan]] tombs (ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate \"Royal kurgans\" containing the \"Scythian triad\" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild-animal art), [[gold]], [[silk]], and animal sacrifices, in places also with suspected [[human sacrifice]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1991|pp=64\u201365, 118}}</ref> [[Mummification]] techniques and [[permafrost]] have aided in the relative preservation of some remains.

The date of this transition is disputed among archaeologists. Dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 7th century BC have been proposed. A transition in the late 8th century has gained the most scholarly support. The origins of the Early Scythian culture is controversial. Many of its elements are of Central Asian origin, but the culture appears to have reached its ultimate form on the Pontic steppe, partially through the influence of [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] elements and to a smaller extent the influence of [[Near East]]ern elements.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe period in the 8th and 7th centuries BC when the Cimmerians and Scythians raided the Near East are ascribed to the later stages of the Early Scythian culture. Examples of Early Scythian burials in the Near East include those of [[:de:Nor\u015funtepe|Nor\u015funtepe]] and [[\u0130mirler, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhac\u0131k\u00f6y|\u0130mirler]]. Objects of Early Scythian type have been found in [[Urartu|Urartian]] fortresses such as [[Teishebaini]], [[Bastam Citadel|Bastam]], and Ayanis-kale. Near Eastern influences are probably explained through objects made by Near Eastern craftsmen on behalf of Scythian chieftains.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:throne arm.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|An arm from the throne of a Scythian king, 7th century BC. Found at the Kelermess [[kurgan]] (burial mound), [[Krasnodar Krai]] in 1905. On exhibit at the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]\n\nEarly Scythian culture is known primarily from its funerary sites, because the Scythians at this time were nomads without permanent settlements. The most important sites are located in the northwestern parts of Scythian territories in the forest steppes of the Dnieper, and the southeastern parts of Scythian territories in the North Caucasus. At this time it was common for the Scythians to be buried in the edges of their territories. Early Scythian sites are characterized by similar artifacts with minor local variations.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Kurgan]]s from the Early Scythian culture have been discovered in the North Caucasus. Some if these are characterized by great wealth, and probably belonged royals of aristocrats. They contain not only the deceased, but also horses and even chariots. The burial rituals carried out in these [[kurgan]]s correspond closely with those described by Herodotus. The greatest kurgans from the Early Scythian culture in the North Caucasus are found at [[:ru:\u041a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Kelermesskaya]], Novozavedennoe II ([[:ru:\u0423\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Ulsky Kurgans]]) and [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]]. One kurgan at Ulsky was found measured at 15 meters in height and contained more than 400 horses. Kurgans from the 7th century BC, when the Scythians were raiding the Near East, typically contain objects of Near Eastern origin. Kurgans from the late 7th century however, contain few Middle Eastern objects, but rather objects of Greek origin, pointing to increased contacts between the Scythians and Greek colonists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been found in the forest steppes of the Dnieper. The most important of these finds is the [[:uk:\u041c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Melgunov Kurgan]]. This kurgan contains several objects of Near Eastern origin so similar to those found at the kurgan in Kelermesskaya that they were probably made in the same workshop. Most of Early Scythian sites in this area are situated along the banks of the Dnieper and its tributiaries. The funerary rites of these sites are similar but not identical to those of the kurgans in the North Caucasus.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been discovered in the areas separating the North Caucasus and the forest steppes. These include the Krivorozhski\u012d kurgan on the eastern banks of the [[Donets]], and the Temir-gora kurgan in the Crimea. Both date to the 7th century BC and contain Greek imports. The Krivorozhski\u012d also display Near Eastern influences.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Placa en forma de c\u00e9rvol tombat, trobada al t\u00famul de Kostromskoy a Kuban, segle VII aC.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|The famous gold stag of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]], Russia]]\n\nApart from funerary sites, numerous settlements from the Early Scythian period have been discovered. Most of these settlements are located in the forest steppe zone and are non-fortified. The most important of these sites in the Dnieper area are [[Trakhtemyriv|Trakhtemirovo]], [[:uk:\u041c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Motroninskoe]], and Pastyrskoe. East of these, at the banks of the [[Vorskla River]], a tributiary of the Dnieper, lies the [[Bilsk, Kotelva Raion|Bilsk]] settlement. Occupying an area of 4,400 hectares with an outer rampart at over 30&nbsp;km, Bilsk is the largest settlement in the forest steppe zone.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> It has been tentatively identified by a team of archaeologists led by [[Boris Shramko]] as the site of [[Gelonus]], the purported capital of Scythia.\n\nAnother important large settlement can be found at [[Myriv]]. Dating from the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Myriv contains a significant amount of imported Greek objects, testifying to lively contacts with [[Borysthenes]], the first Greek colony established on the Pontic steppe (ca. 625 BC). Within the ramparts in these settlements there were areas without buildings, which where probably occupied by nomadic Scythians seasonally visiting the sites.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Early Scythian culture came to an end in the latter part of the 6th century BC.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Classical Scythian===\n[[File:Scythian capital and royal kurgans.png|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of Scythian kurgans and other sites along the [[Dnieper Rapids]] during the Classical Scythian period]]\nBy the end of the 6th century BC, a new period begins in the material culture of the Scythians. Certain scholars consider this a new stage in the Scythian culture, while others consider it an entirely new archaeological culture. It is possible that this new culture arose through the settlement of a new wave of nomads from the east, who intermingled with the local Scythians. The Classical Scythian period saw major changes in Scythian material culture, both with regards to weapons and art style. This was largely through Greek influence. Other elements had probably been brought from the east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nLike in Early Scythian culture, the Classical Scythian culture is primarily represented through funerary sites. The area of distribution of these sites has however changed. Most of them, including the richest, are located on the Pontic steppe, in particular the area around the [[Dnieper Rapids]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nAt the end of the 6th century BC, new funerary rites appeared, characterized by more complex kurgans. This new style was rapidly adopted throughout Scythian territory. Like before, elite burials usually contained horses. A buried king was usually accompanied with multiple people from his entourage. Burials containing both males and females are quite common both in elite burials and in the burials of the common people.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important Scythian kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture in the 6th and 5th centuries BC are Ostraya Tomakovskaya Mogila, Zavadskaya Mogila 1, Novogrigor\u2019evka 5, Baby and Raskopana Mogila in the Dnieper Rapids, and the Zolotoi and Kulakovski\u012d kurgans in the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe greatest, so-called \"royal\" kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture are dated to the 4th century BC. These include [[Solokha]], [[:uk:\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430|Bol\u2019shaya Cymbalka]], [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043b\u044b\u043a (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Chertomlyk]], [[:uk:\u041e\u0433\u0443\u0437 (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Oguz]], [[:ru:\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Alexandropol]], and [[:uk:\u041a\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043b (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Kozel]].

These include several unusually rich burials such as [[Kul-Oba]] (near [[Panticapaeum]] in the Crimea) and the necropolis of [[Nymphaion (Crimea)|Nymphaion]]. The sites probably represent Scythian aristocrats who had close ties, if not family ties, with the elite of Nymphaion and aristocrats, perhaps even royals, of the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn total, more than 3,000 Scythian funerary sites from the 4th century BC have been discovered on the Pontic steppe. This number far exceeds the number of all funerary sites from previous centuries.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from funerary sites, remains of Scythian cities from this period have been discovered. These include both continuations from the Early Scythian period and newly founded settlements. The most important of these is the settlement of [[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Kamenskoe]] on the Dniepr, which existed from the 5th century to the beginning of the 3rd century BC. It was a fortified settlement occupying an area of 12 square km. The chief occupation of its inhabitants appears to have been metalworking, and the city was probably an important supplier of metalwork for the nomadic Scythians. Part of the population was probably composed of agriculturalists. It is likely that Kamenskoe also served as a political center in Scythia. A significant part of Kamenskoe was not built up, perhaps to set it aside for the Scythian king and his entourage during their seasonal visits to the city.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> [[J\u00e1nos Harmatta]] suggests that Kamenskoe served as a residence for the Scythian king Ateas.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nBy the 4th century it appears that some of the Scythians were adopting an agricultural way of life similar to the peoples of the forest steppes. As result, a number of fortified and non-fortified settlements spring up in the areas of the lower Dnieper. Part of the settled inhabitants of Olbia were also of Scythian origin.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nClassical Scythian culture lasts until the late 4th century or early 3rd century BC.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Late Scythian===\n[[File:Simferopol, Scythian Neapolis, 2016.06.17 (04) (29608182661).jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Remains of [[Scythian Neapolis]] near modern-day [[Simferopol]], Crimea. It served as a political center of the Scythians in the Late Scythian period.]]\nThe last period in the Scythian archaeological culture is the Late Scythian culture, which existed in the Crimea and the Lower Dnieper from the 3rd century BC. This area was at the time mostly settled by Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nArchaeologically the Late Scythian culture has little in common with its predecessors. It represents a fusion of Scythian traditions with those of the Greek colonists and the [[Tauri]], who inhabited the mountains of the Crimea. The population of the Late Scythian culture was mainly settled, and were engaged in stockbreeding and agriculture. They were also important traders, serving as intermediaries between the [[classical world]] and the [[barbarian]] world.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nRecent excavations at [[:ru:\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe]] implies that this site was the political center of the Scythians in the 3rd century BC and the early part of the 2nd century BC. It was a well protected fortress constructed in accordance with Greek principles.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important site of the Late Crimean culture is Scythian Neaoplis, which was located in Crimea and served as the capital of the Late Scythian kingdom from the early 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 3rd century AD. Scythian Neapolis was largely constructed in accordance with Greek principles. Its royal palace was destroyed by [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]], a general of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], at the end of the 2nd century BC, and was not rebuilt. The city nevertheless continued to exist as a major urban center. It underwent significant change from the 1st century to the 2nd century AD, eventually being left with virtually no buildings except from its fortifications. New funerary rites and material features also appear. It is probable that these changes represent the assimilation of the Scythians by the Sarmatians. A certain continuity is however observable. From the end of the 2nd century to the middle of the 3rd century AD, Scythian Neapolis transforms into a non-fortified settlement containing only a few buildings.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from Scythian Neapolis and Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe, more than 100 fortified and non-fortified settlements from the Late Scythian culture have been discovered. They are often accompanied by a necropolis. Late Scythian sites are mostly found in areas around the foothills of the Crimean mountains and along the western coast of the Crimea. Some of these settlements had earlier been Greek settlements, such as [[Kalos Limen]] and [[Kerkinitis]]. Many of these coastal settlements served as trading ports.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe largest Scythian settlements after Neapolis and Ak-Kaya-Vishennoe were [[:ru:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d\u043e (\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c)|Bulganak]], [[:ru:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u0410\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ust-Alma]], and [[:ru:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u041a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d-\u041a\u044b\u0440|Kermen-Kyr]]. Like Neapolis and Ak-Kaya, these are characterized by a combination of Greek architectural principles and local ones.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nA unique group of Late Scythian settlements were city-states located on the banks of the Lower Dnieper. The material culture of these settlements was even more Hellenized than those on the Crimea, and they were probably closely connected to Olbia, if not dependent it.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBurials of the Late Scythian culture can be divided into two kurgans and necropolises, with necropolises becoming more and more common as time progresses. The largest such necropolis has been found at Ust-Alma.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBecause of close similarities between the material culture of the Late Scythians and that of neighboring Greek cities, many scholars have suggested that Late Scythian cites, particularly those of the Lower Dnieper, were populated at last partly by Greeks. Influences of Sarmatian elements and the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] have been pointed out.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Late Scythian culture ends in the 3rd century AD.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n==Culture and society==\n[[File:\u0421\u043a\u0456\u0444\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0456. \u041a\u0430\u043c'\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0430 \u0437 \u0417\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0438 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Kurgan stelae]] of a Scythian at [[Khortytsia]], Ukraine]]\nSince the Scythians did not have a written language, their non-material culture can only be pieced together through writings by non-Scythian authors, parallels found among other Iranian peoples, and archaeological evidence.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Tribal divisions===\n{{See also|Trifunctional hypothesis}}\nScythians lived in [[Confederation|confederated]] tribes, a political form of voluntary association which regulated pastures and organised a common defence against encroaching neighbours for the pastoral tribes of mostly [[Domestication of the horse|equestrian]] herdsmen. While the productivity of domesticated animal-breeding greatly exceeded that of the settled agricultural societies, the pastoral economy also needed supplemental agricultural produce, and stable nomadic confederations developed either symbiotic or forced alliances with sedentary peoples \u2013 in exchange for animal produce and military protection.\n\nHerodotus relates that three main tribes of the Scythians descended from three sons of Targitaus: Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais. They called themselves Scoloti, after one of their kings.<ref>Traces of the Iranian root ''x\u0161aya'' \u2013 \"ruler\" \u2013 may persist in all three names.</ref> Herodotus writes that the Auchatae tribe descended from Lipoxais, the Catiari and Traspians from Arpoxais, and the Paralatae (Royal Scythians) from Colaxais, who was the youngest brother.<ref name=\"Herodotus_4.5\">{{harvnb|Herodotus|1910}}, [[:Wikisource:The History of Herodotus (Rawlinson)/Book 4|4.5-4.7]]</ref> According to Herodotus the Royal Scythians were the largest and most powerful Scythian tribe, and looked \"upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves.\"<ref name=\"Herodotus_4.20\">{{harvnb|Herodotus|1910}}, [[:Wikisource:The History of Herodotus (Rawlinson)/Book 4|4.20]]</ref>\n\nAlthough scholars have traditionally treated the three tribes as geographically distinct, [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] interpreted the divine gifts as the symbols of social occupations, illustrating his [[trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional vision]] of early [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] societies: the plough and yoke symbolised the farmers, the axe \u2013 the warriors, the bowl \u2013 the priests. The first scholar to compare the three strata of Scythian society to the Indian [[caste]]s was [[Arthur Christensen]]. According to Dum\u00e9zil, \"the fruitless attempts of Arpoxais and Lipoxais, in contrast to the success of Colaxais, may explain why the highest strata was not that of farmers or magicians, but rather that of warriors.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Belier|1991|p=69}}</ref>\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Scythians shooting with bows Kertch antique Panticapeum Ukrainia 4th century BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Scythian archers shooting with the [[Composite bow|Scythian bow]], [[Kerch]] (ancient [[Panticapeum]]), [[Crimea]], 4th century BC.

When engaged at war, almost the entire adult population, including a large number of women, would participate in battle.<ref name=\"Cernenko_20\">{{harvnb|Chernenko|2012|p=20}}</ref> The Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] noted that no people in either Europe or Asia could resist the Scythians without outside aid.<ref name=\"Cernenko_20\"/>\n\nScythians were particularly known for their [[equestrianism|equestrian]] skills, and their early use of [[composite bow]]s shot from horseback. With great mobility, the Scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry, just retreating into the steppes. Such tactics wore down their enemies, making them easier to defeat. The Scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors. Ruled by small numbers of closely allied elites, Scythians had a reputation for their [[Archery|archers]], and many gained employment as [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Scythian elites had [[kurgan]] tombs: high barrows heaped over chamber-tombs of [[larch]] wood, a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life-renewal, for it stands bare in winter.\n\nThe [[Ziwiye hoard]], a treasure of gold and silver metalwork and ivory found near the town of [[Sakiz]] south of [[Lake Urmia]] and dated to between 680 and 625 BC, includes objects with Scythian \"[[animal style]]\" features. One silver dish from this find bears some inscriptions, as yet undeciphered and so possibly representing a form of Scythian writing.\n\nScythians also had a reputation for the use of barbed and poisoned arrows of several types, for a [[nomadic]] life centred on horses \u2013 \"fed from horse-blood\" according to Herodotus \u2013 and for skill in [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSome Scythian-Sarmatian cultures may have given rise to Greek stories of [[Amazons]]. Graves of armed females have been found in southern Ukraine and Russia. [[David W. Anthony|David Anthony]] notes, \"About 20% of Scythian-Sarmatian 'warrior graves' on the lower Don and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were men, a style that may have inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\"<ref name=\"Anthony_329\">{{harvnb|Anthony|2010|p=329}}</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Scythian Warriors.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Scythian warriors, drawn after figures on an [[electrum]] cup from the [[Kul-Oba]] [[kurgan]] burial near [[Kerch]], Crimea.

Scythians apparently wore their hair long and loose, and all adult men apparently bearded. The ''[[gorytos]]'' appears clearly on the left hip of the bare-headed spearman. The shield of the central figure may be made of plain leather over a wooden or wicker base. ([[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg)]]\nAccording to Herodotus, Scythian costume consisted of padded and quilted leather trousers tucked into boots, and open tunics. They rode without [[stirrups]] or saddles, using only saddle-cloths. Herodotus reports that Scythians used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], both to weave their clothing and to cleanse themselves in its smoke (Hist. 4.73\u201375); archaeology has confirmed the use of cannabis in funerary rituals. Men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear \u2013 either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap.\n\nWomen wore a variety of different headdresses, some conical in shape others more like flattened cylinders, also adorned with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nScythian women wore long, loose robes, ornamented with metal plaques (gold). Women wore shawls, often richly decorated with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nBased on numerous archeological findings in Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan, men and warrior women wore long sleeve tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts.\n\nMen and women wore long trousers, often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt appliqu\u00e9s; trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area. Materials used depended on the wealth, climate, and necessity.\n\nMen and women warriors wore variations of long and shorter boots, wool-leather-felt gaiter-boots, and moccasin-like shoes. They were either of a laced or simple slip on type.\nWomen wore also soft shoes with metal (gold) plaques.\n\nMen and women wore belts. Warrior belts were made of leather, often with gold or other metal adornments and had many attached leather thongs for fastening of the owner's [[gorytos]], sword, whet stone, whip etc. Belts were fastened with metal or horn [[belt hook|belt-hooks]], leather thongs, and metal (often golden) or horn belt-plates.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Scythian religion}}\n[[Scythian religion]] was a type of [[Ancient Iranian religion|Pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion]] and differed from the post-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Iranian thoughts.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\">{{harvnb|Harmatta|1996|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> The Scythian belief was a more archaic stage than the Zoroastrian and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] systems. The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nOur most important literary source on Scythian religion is Herodotus. According to him the leading deity in the Scythian pantheon was [[Tabiti]], whom he compared to the Greek god [[Hestia]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Tabiti was eventually replaced by [[Atar]], the fire-pantheon of Iranian tribes, and [[Agni]], the fire deity of [[Indo-Aryans]].<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>  Other deities mentioned by Herodotus include Papaios, Api, Goitosyros/Oitosyros, Argimpasa, and Thagimasadas, whom he identified with [[Zeus]], [[Gaia]], [[Apollo]], [[Aphrodite]], and [[Poseidon]] respectively. The Scythians are also said by Herodotus to have worshipped equivalents of [[Heracles]] and [[Ares]], but he does not mention their Scythian names.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> An additional Scythian deity, the goddess Dithagoia, is mentioned in the a dedication by Senamotis, daughter of King Skiluros, at Panticapaeum. Most of the names of Scythian deities can be traced back to Iranian roots.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nHerodotus states that Thagimasadas was worshipped by the Royal Scythians only, while the remaining deities were worshipped by all. He also states that \"Ares\", the god of war, was the only god to whom the Scythians dedicated statues, altars or temples. [[Tumuli]] were erected to him in every Scythian district, and both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices were performed in honor of him. At least one shrine to \"Ares\" has been discovered by archaeologists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Scythians had professional priests, but it is not known is they constituted a heridetary class. Among the priests there was a separate group, the [[Enarei]], who worshipped the goddess [[Argimpasa]] and assumed feminine identities.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the \"First Man\", who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings. Similar myths are common among other Iranian peoples. Considerable importance was given to the division of Scythian society into three hereditary classes, which consisted of warriors, priests, and producers. Kings were considered part of the warrior class. Royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> The Iranian principle of royal charisma, known as [[khvarenah]] in the [[Avesta]], played a prominent role in Scythian society. It is probable that the Scythians had a number of epic legends, which were possibly the source for Herodotus writings on them.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Traces of these epics can be found in the epics of the Ossetians of the present day.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nIn Scythian cosmology the world was divided into three parts, with the warriors, considered part of the upper world, the priests of the middle level, and the producers of the lower one.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Scythian art}}\n[[File:Placca pantera, da regione di krasnodar, kurgan chertomlyk, oro a sbalzo e cesellato, fine VII sec ac..JPG|thumb|Gold plaque with panther, probably for a shield or breast-plate, 13 in/33 cm long, end 7th-century BC]]\n[[File:Scythian comb.jpg|thumb|Scythian comb from [[Solokha]], early 4th century BC]]\nThe art of the Scythians and related peoples of the Scythian cultures is known as [[Scythian art]]. It is particularly characterized by its use of the [[animal style]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style appears in an already established form Eastern Europe in the 8th century BC along with the Early Scythian archaeological culture itself. It bears little resemblance to the art of pre-Scythian cultures of the area. Some scholars suggest the art style developed under Near Eastern influence during the military campaigns of the 7th century BC, but the more common theory is that it developed on the eastern part of the Eurasian Steppe under Chinese influence. Others have sought to reconcile the two theories, suggesting that the animal style of the west and eastern parts of the steppe developed independently of each other, under Near Eastern and Chinese influences respectively. Regardless, the animal style art of the Scythians differs considerable from that of peoples living further east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style works are typically divided into birds, ungulates, and beasts of prey. This probably reflects the tripatriate division of the Scythian cosmos, with birds belonging to the upper level, ungulates to the middle level, and beasts of prey in the lower level.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImages of mythological creatures such a [[griffin]]s are not uncommon in Scythian animal style, but these are probably the result of Near Eastern influences. By the late 6th century, as Scythian activity in the Near East was reduced, depictions of mythological creatures largely disappears from Scythian art. It however reappears again in the 4th century BC as a result of Greek influence.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Anthropomorphic]] depictions in Early Scythian art is known only from [[kurgan stelae]]. These depict warriors with almond-shaped eyes and mustaches, often including weapons and other military equipment.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nSince the 5th century BC, Scythian art changed considerably. This was probably a result of Greek and Persian influence, and possibly also internal developments caused by an arrival of a new nomadic people from the east. The changes are notable in the more realistic depictions of animals, who are now often depicted fighting each other rather than being depicted individually. Kurgan stelae of the time also display traces of Greek influences, with warriors being depicted with rounder eyes and full beards.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe 4th century BC show additional Greek influence. While animal style was still in use, it appears that much Scythian art by this point was being made by Greek craftsmen on behalf of Scythians. Such objects are frequently found in royal Scythian burials of the period. Depictions of human beings become more prevalent. Many objects of Scythian art made by Greeks are probably illustrations of Scythian legends. Several objects are believed to have been of religious significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBy the late 3rd century BC, original Scythian art disappears through ongoing Hellenization. The creation of anthropomorphic gravestones continued however.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nWorks of Scythian art are held at many museums and has been featured at many exhibitions. The largest collections of Scythian art are found at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and the Museum of Historical Treasures of the Ukraine in [[Kiev]], while smaller collections are found at the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] of [[Oxford]], and the [[Louvre]] of [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> \n\n=== Gender ===\nThe idea of gender was [[Gender-fluid|fluid]] in the Scythian culture. [[Barry Cunliffe]] says, \"[the idea] that gender boundaries were fluid among the Scythians is explicitly stated by various classical observers, most notably Herodotus and Pseudo-Hippocrates.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218; quote found in \"Further Reading\" section at the end of the book|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Women ====\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] (a people considered part of Scythian culture) women would ride on horseback; and they use a bow and throw [[Javelin|javelins]] from their horses. He continues by saying that the women would remain virgins until they could kill three of their enemies. Pseudo-Hippocrates also says that young girls would have their right [[breast]] [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to stop it from developing; this would help give the young warrior enhanced strength as an archer. Herodotus called these women Amazons (meaning \"without a breast,\" in Greek). Women had a prominent role in hunting and in battle, according to Herodotus. He also says that women would sometimes [[Cross-dressing|dress like men]]. According to Barry Cunliffe, these accounts confirm each other and they are partially supported by archaeological evidence. In the old Sarmatian territory, one fifth of the warrior burials, dating to the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, are female; and a fifth of female graves contain weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218\u201320; 123|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Men ====\n{{Main|Enaree}}\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that some Scythian men were [[Eunuch|eunuchs]], spoke like women, performed female work, and wore female attire.

He said that gender transfer was more common among the rich and elite. Herodotus also noted the effeminacy of some Scythian men.

According to Chiasson, Herodotus' portrayal of the Enaree is much more accurate than Pseudo-Hippocrates' portrayal of them as aristocrats. Chiasson suggests that the reason for Pseudo-Hippocrates' view of the Scythians is because of his theory of [[climatic determinism]], where the climate affects both the physical and psychological characteristics of people. For example, he claims that the variation of Europe's climate made Europeans more courageous, fiercer, and more warlike than Asians. Pseudo-Hippocrates says that the cold and moist climate that the Scythians lived in robbed them of their desire for sex and that their nomadic lifestyle robbed them of the strength for sex\u2009\u2014\u2009the nomadic lifestyle entails excessive horse riding and too much trouser wearing, which, according to Pseudo-Hippocrates, robs men of the strength to have sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiasson|first=Charles|date=2001|title=Scythian Androgyny and Environmental Determinism in Herodotus and the Hippocratic \u03c0\u03f5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03f5\u0301\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03b4\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u00f3\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd|journal=Syllecta Classica|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=33\u201373|doi=10.1353/syl.2001.0007|issn=2160-5157}}</ref> The scholar and archaeologist [[Ellis Minns]] said that Pseudo-Hippocrates may have been correct in asserting that constant horse riding caused the phenomenon.

In the second paragraph of the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], the \u00e9lite of [[Scotland]] claim Scythia as a former homeland of the [[Scottish people|Scots]].

[[Gregory of Tours]] documents in his ''History of the Franks'' that when [[Clovis I|Clovis]] was baptised, he was referred to as a Sicamber with the words \"Mitis depone colla, Sicamber, adora quod incendisti, incendi quod adorasti.\" The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] in turn reveals that the Franks believed the Sicambri to be a tribe of Scythian or Cimmerian descent, who had changed their name to [[Franks]] in honour of their chieftain Franco in 11 BC.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, foreigners regarded the [[Russians]] as descendants of Scythians. It became conventional to refer to Russians as Scythians in 18th-century poetry, and [[Alexander Blok]] drew on this tradition sarcastically in his last major poem, ''The Scythians'' (1920). In the 19th century, romantic revisionists in the West transformed the \"[[barbarian]]\" Scyths of literature into the wild and free, hardy and democratic ancestors of all blond [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].\n\nBased on such accounts of Scythian founders of certain Germanic as well as Celtic tribes, British historiography in the [[British Empire]] period such as [[Sharon Turner]] in his ''[[History of the Anglo-Saxons]]'', made them the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]].\n\n==Related ancient peoples==\nHerodotus and other classical historians listed quite a number of tribes who lived near the Scythians, and presumably shared the same general milieu and nomadic steppe culture, often called \"Scythian culture\", even though scholars may have difficulties in determining their exact relationship to the \"linguistic Scythians\".

Targitaus allegedly lived a thousand years before the failed Persian invasion of [[Scythia]], or around 1500 BC. He had three sons, before whom fell from the sky a set of four golden implements \u2013 a plough, a yoke, a cup, and a battle-axe. Only the youngest son succeeded in touching the golden implements without them bursting with fire, and this son's descendants, called by Herodotus the \"Royal Scythians\", continued to guard them.\n# Secondly (4.8), a legend told by the [[Pontic Greeks]] featuring Scythes, the first king of the Scythians, as a child of [[Hercules]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]].\n# Thirdly (4.11), in the version which Herodotus said he believed most, the Scythians came from a more southern part of [[Central Asia]], until a war with the Massagetae (a powerful tribe of steppe nomads who lived just northeast of [[Persia]]) forced them westward.\n# Finally (4.13), a legend which Herodotus attributed to the Greek bard [[Aristeas]], who claimed to have got himself into such a Bacchanalian fury that he ran all the way northeast across Scythia and further. According to this, the Scythians originally lived south of the [[Urals|Rhipaean mountains]], until they got into a conflict with a tribe called the [[Issedones]], pressed in their turn by the \"one-eyed [[Arimaspi]]ans\"; and so the Scythians decided to migrate westwards.\n\nAccounts by Herodotus of Scythian origins has been discounted recently; although his accounts of Scythian raiding activities contemporary to his writings have been deemed more reliable.<ref>{{harvnb|Drews|2004|p=92}} \"Ever since critical history began, scholars have recognized that much of what Herodotos gives us is silly.\"</ref>\n\n====Archaeological evidence====\n[[File:Scythian cultures.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Distribution of the [[Scythian cultures]], of which the Scythians were part]]\nModern interpretation of historical, archaeological, and anthropological evidence has proposed two broad hypotheses on Scythian origins.<ref name=\"M_51\"/>\n\nThe first hypothesis, formerly more espoused by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and then [[Russia]]n researchers, roughly followed Herodotus' (third) account, holding that the Scythians were an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]-speaking group who arrived from [[Inner Asia]], i.e. from the area of [[Turkestan]] and western Siberia.\n<ref name=\"M_51\">{{harvnb|Mallory|1991|pp=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe second hypothesis, according to [[Roman Ghirshman]] and others, proposes that the Scythian cultural complex emerged from local groups of the [[Srubna culture]] at the Black Sea coast,<ref name=\"M_51\"/> although this is also associated with the Cimmerians. According to [[Pavel Dolukhanov]] this proposal is supported by anthropological evidence which has found that Scythian skulls are similar to preceding findings from the Srubna culture, and distinct from those of the Central Asian Saka.<ref>{{harvnb|Dolukhanov|1996|p=125}}</ref> Yet, according to [[J.

He classes the Cimmerians as a distinct [[autochthon (person)|autochthonous]] tribe, expelled by the Scythians from the northern Black Sea coast (''Hist.'' 4.11\u201312). Herodotus also states (4.6) that the Scythians consisted of the [[Auchatae]], [[Catiaroi]], [[Traspians]], and [[Paralatae]] or \"Royal Scythians\".\n\nIn the early 7th century BC, the Scythians and Cimmerians are recorded in Assyrian texts as having conquered [[Urartu]]. In the 670s, the Scythians under their king [[Bartatua]] raided the territories of the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]] managed to make peace with the Scythians by paying a large amount of tribute.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Bartatua was succeeded by his son [[Madius]] ca. 645 BC, after which they launched a great raid on [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Madius subsequently subjugated the [[Median Empire]]. During this time, Herodotus notes that the Scythians raided and exacted tribute from \"the whole of Asia\". In the 620s, [[Cyaxares]], leader of the [[Medes]], treacherously killed a large number of Scythian chieftains at a feast; the Scythians were subsequently driven back to the steppe. In 612 BC, the Medes and Scythians participated in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire with the [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Battle of Nineveh]]. During this period of influence in the Middle East, the Scythians became heavily influenced by the local civilizations.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nIn the 6th century BC, the [[Greeks]] had begun establishing settlements along the coasts and rivers of th Pontic steppe, coming in contact with the Scythians. Relations between the Greeks and the Scythians appear to have been peaceful, with the Scythians being substantially influenced by the Greeks, although the city of the [[Panticapaeum]] might have been destroyed by the Scythians in the mid century BC.

Planning an invasion of Greece, Darius first sought to secure his northern flank against Scythian inroads. Thus, Darius [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|declared war on the Scythians]].<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> At first, Darius sent his [[Cappadocia]]n satrap [[Ariamnes]] with a vast fleet (estimated at 600 ships by Herodotus) into Scythian territory, where several Scythian nobles were captured. He then built a bridge across the [[Bosporus]] and easily defeated the [[Thracians]], crossing the [[Danube]] into Scythian territory with a large army (700,000 men if one is to believe Herodotus) in 512 BC.<ref name=\"Cernenko_21\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=21\u201329}}</ref> At this time Scythians were separated into three major kingdoms, with the leader of the largest tribe, King [[Idanthyrsus]], being the supreme ruler, and his subordinate kings being [[Scopasis]] and [[Taxacis]].\n\nUnable to receive support from neighboring nomadic peoples against the Persians, the Scythians evacuated their civilians and livestock to the north and adopted a [[scorched earth]] strategy, while simultaneously harassing the extensive Persian supply lines. Suffering heavy losses, the Persians reached as far as the [[Sea of Azov]], until Darius was compelled to enter into negotiations with Idanthyrsus, which however broke down. Darius and his army eventually retreated across the Danube back into Persia, and the Scythians thereafter earned a reputation of invincibility among neighboring peoples.<ref name=\"Cernenko_21\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Golden Age===\nIn the aftermath of their defeat of the Persian invasion, Scythian power grew considerably, and they launched campaigns against their Thracian neighbors in the west.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=29\u201332}}</ref> In 496 BC, the Scythians launched an great expedition into Thrace, reaching as far as [[Chersonesos (Thrace)|Chersonesos]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> During this time they negotiated an alliance with the Achaemenid Empire against the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes I]]. A prominent king of the Scythians in the 5th century was [[Scyles]].<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\nThe Scythian offensive against the Thracians was checked by the [[Odrysian kingdom]]. The border between the Scythians and the Odrysian kingdom was thereafter set at the Danube, and relations between the two dynasties were good, with dynastic marriages frequently occurring.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> The Scythians also expanded towards the north-west, where they destroyed numerous fortified settlements and probably subjucated numerous settled populations. A similar fate was suffered by the Greek cities of the northwestern Black Sea coast and parts of the Crimea, over which the Scythians established political control.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Greek settlements along the [[Don River]] also came under the control of the Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nA division of responsibility developed, with the Scythians holding the political and military power, the urban population carrying out trade, and the local sedentary population carrying out manual labor.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their territories grew grain, and shipped wheat, flocks, and cheese to Greece. The Scythians apparently obtained much of their wealth from their control over the [[slave trade]] from the north to Greece through the Greek [[Black Sea]] [[apoikia|colonial ports]] of [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], and [[Gorgippia]].\n\nWhen Herodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the 5th century BC, Greeks distinguished [[Scythia Minor]], in present-day [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], from a [[Scythia|Greater Scythia]] that extended eastwards for a 20-day ride from the Danube River, across the [[steppe]]s of today's East Ukraine to the lower [[Don River, Russia|Don]] basin.\n\nScythian offensives against the Greek colonies of the northeastern Black Sea coast were largely unsuccessful, as the Greeks united under the leadership of the city of Panticapaeum and put up a vigorous defence. These Greek cities developed into the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. Meanwhile, several Greek colonies formerly under Scythian control began to reassert their independence. It is possible that the Scythians were suffering from internal troubles during this time.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the mid 4th century BC, the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to the east of the Scythians, began expanding into Scythian territory.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\n[[Image:Skiluros.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scythian king [[Skilurus]], relief from [[Scythian Neapolis]], Crimea, 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC]]\n\nThe 4th century BC was a flowering of Scythian culture. The Scythian king [[Ateas]] managed to unite under his power the Scythian tribes living between the [[Maeotian Swamp|Maeotian marshes]] and the Danube, while simultaneously enroaching upon the Thracians.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> He conquered territories along the Danube as far the [[Sava]] river and established a trade route from the Black Sea to the [[Adriatic]], which enabled a flourishing of trade in the Scythian kingdom. The westward expansion of Ateas brought him into conflict with [[Philip II of Macedon]] (reigned 359 to 336 BC), with whom he had previously been allied,<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> who took military action against the Scythians in 339 BC. Ateas died in battle, and his empire disintegrated.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], continued the conflict with the Scythians. In 331 BC, his general [[Zopyrion]] invaded Scythian territory with a force of 30,000 men, but was routed and killed by the Scythians near Olbia.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the aftermath of conflict between Macedon and the Scythians, the [[Celts]] seem to have displaced the Scythians from the [[Balkans]]; while in south Russia, a kindred tribe, the Sarmatians, gradually overwhelmed them. In 310-309 BC, as noted by [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Scythians, in alliance with the Bosporan Kingdom, defeated the [[Siraces]] in a [[Battle of the River Thatis|great battle]] at the river Thatis.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/>\n\nBy the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian culture of the Pontic steppe suddenly disappears. The reasons for this are controversial, but the expansion of the Sarmatians certainly played a role. The Scythians in turn shifted their focus towards the Greek cities of the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Roman Empire 125 (cropped).png|thumb|right|The territory of the Scythae Basilaei (\"Royal Scyths\") along the north shore of the [[Black Sea]] around 125 AD.]]\n\nBy ca. 200 BC, the Scythians had largely withdrawn into the [[Crimea]]. By the time of Strabo's account (the first decades AD), the Crimean Scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower Dnieper to the Crimea, centered at [[Scythian Neapolis]] near modern [[Simferopol]]. They had become more settled and were intermingling with the local populations, in particular the [[Tauri]], and were also subjected to [[Hellenization]]. They maintained close relations with the Bosporan Kingdom, with whose dynasty they were linked by marriage. A separate Scythian territory, known as Scythia Minor, existed in modern-day [[Dobruja]], but was of little significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, the Scythian kings [[Skilurus]] and [[Palakus]] sought to exent their control over the Greek cities of north of the Black Sea. The Greek cities of Chersonesus and Olbia in turn requested the aid [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], whose general [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]] defeated their armies in battle, took their capital and annexed their territory to the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/><ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> After this time, the Scythians practically disappeared from history.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> Scythia Minor was also defeated by Mithradates.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the years after the death of Mithradates, the Scythians had transitioned to a settled way of life and were assimilating into neighboring populations. They made a resurgence in the 1st century AD and laid siege to Chersonesos, who were obliged to seek help from the [[Roman Empire]]. The Scythians were in turn defeated by Roman commander [[Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the 2nd century AD, archaeological evidence show that the Scythians had been largely assimilated by the Sarmatians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their capital city, Scythian Neapolis, was destroyed by the invading [[Goths]] in the mid-3rd century AD.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Avar\u00e1rok.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Scythian defence line 339 BC reconstruction in [[Polg\u00e1r, Hungary]] ]]\nArchaeological remains of the Scythians include [[kurgans|kurgan]] tombs (ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate \"Royal kurgans\" containing the \"Scythian triad\" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild-animal art), [[gold]], [[silk]], and animal sacrifices, in places also with suspected [[human sacrifice]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1991|pp=64\u201365, 118}}</ref> [[Mummification]] techniques and [[permafrost]] have aided in the relative preservation of some remains.

The date of this transition is disputed among archaeologists. Dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 7th century BC have been proposed. A transition in the late 8th century has gained the most scholarly support. The origins of the Early Scythian culture is controversial. Many of its elements are of Central Asian origin, but the culture appears to have reached its ultimate form on the Pontic steppe, partially through the influence of [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] elements and to a smaller extent the influence of [[Near East]]ern elements.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe period in the 8th and 7th centuries BC when the Cimmerians and Scythians raided the Near East are ascribed to the later stages of the Early Scythian culture. Examples of Early Scythian burials in the Near East include those of [[:de:Nor\u015funtepe|Nor\u015funtepe]] and [[\u0130mirler, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhac\u0131k\u00f6y|\u0130mirler]]. Objects of Early Scythian type have been found in [[Urartu|Urartian]] fortresses such as [[Teishebaini]], [[Bastam Citadel|Bastam]], and Ayanis-kale. Near Eastern influences are probably explained through objects made by Near Eastern craftsmen on behalf of Scythian chieftains.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:throne arm.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|An arm from the throne of a Scythian king, 7th century BC. Found at the Kelermess [[kurgan]] (burial mound), [[Krasnodar Krai]] in 1905. On exhibit at the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]\n\nEarly Scythian culture is known primarily from its funerary sites, because the Scythians at this time were nomads without permanent settlements. The most important sites are located in the northwestern parts of Scythian territories in the forest steppes of the Dnieper, and the southeastern parts of Scythian territories in the North Caucasus. At this time it was common for the Scythians to be buried in the edges of their territories. Early Scythian sites are characterized by similar artifacts with minor local variations.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Kurgan]]s from the Early Scythian culture have been discovered in the North Caucasus. Some if these are characterized by great wealth, and probably belonged royals of aristocrats. They contain not only the deceased, but also horses and even chariots. The burial rituals carried out in these [[kurgan]]s correspond closely with those described by Herodotus. The greatest kurgans from the Early Scythian culture in the North Caucasus are found at [[:ru:\u041a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Kelermesskaya]], Novozavedennoe II ([[:ru:\u0423\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Ulsky Kurgans]]) and [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]]. One kurgan at Ulsky was found measured at 15 meters in height and contained more than 400 horses. Kurgans from the 7th century BC, when the Scythians were raiding the Near East, typically contain objects of Near Eastern origin. Kurgans from the late 7th century however, contain few Middle Eastern objects, but rather objects of Greek origin, pointing to increased contacts between the Scythians and Greek colonists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been found in the forest steppes of the Dnieper. The most important of these finds is the [[:uk:\u041c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Melgunov Kurgan]]. This kurgan contains several objects of Near Eastern origin so similar to those found at the kurgan in Kelermesskaya that they were probably made in the same workshop. Most of Early Scythian sites in this area are situated along the banks of the Dnieper and its tributiaries. The funerary rites of these sites are similar but not identical to those of the kurgans in the North Caucasus.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been discovered in the areas separating the North Caucasus and the forest steppes. These include the Krivorozhski\u012d kurgan on the eastern banks of the [[Donets]], and the Temir-gora kurgan in the Crimea. Both date to the 7th century BC and contain Greek imports. The Krivorozhski\u012d also display Near Eastern influences.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Placa en forma de c\u00e9rvol tombat, trobada al t\u00famul de Kostromskoy a Kuban, segle VII aC.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|The famous gold stag of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]], Russia]]\n\nApart from funerary sites, numerous settlements from the Early Scythian period have been discovered. Most of these settlements are located in the forest steppe zone and are non-fortified. The most important of these sites in the Dnieper area are [[Trakhtemyriv|Trakhtemirovo]], [[:uk:\u041c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Motroninskoe]], and Pastyrskoe. East of these, at the banks of the [[Vorskla River]], a tributiary of the Dnieper, lies the [[Bilsk, Kotelva Raion|Bilsk]] settlement. Occupying an area of 4,400 hectares with an outer rampart at over 30&nbsp;km, Bilsk is the largest settlement in the forest steppe zone.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> It has been tentatively identified by a team of archaeologists led by [[Boris Shramko]] as the site of [[Gelonus]], the purported capital of Scythia.\n\nAnother important large settlement can be found at [[Myriv]]. Dating from the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Myriv contains a significant amount of imported Greek objects, testifying to lively contacts with [[Borysthenes]], the first Greek colony established on the Pontic steppe (ca. 625 BC). Within the ramparts in these settlements there were areas without buildings, which where probably occupied by nomadic Scythians seasonally visiting the sites.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Early Scythian culture came to an end in the latter part of the 6th century BC.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Classical Scythian===\n[[File:Scythian capital and royal kurgans.png|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of Scythian kurgans and other sites along the [[Dnieper Rapids]] during the Classical Scythian period]]\nBy the end of the 6th century BC, a new period begins in the material culture of the Scythians. Certain scholars consider this a new stage in the Scythian culture, while others consider it an entirely new archaeological culture. It is possible that this new culture arose through the settlement of a new wave of nomads from the east, who intermingled with the local Scythians. The Classical Scythian period saw major changes in Scythian material culture, both with regards to weapons and art style. This was largely through Greek influence. Other elements had probably been brought from the east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nLike in Early Scythian culture, the Classical Scythian culture is primarily represented through funerary sites. The area of distribution of these sites has however changed. Most of them, including the richest, are located on the Pontic steppe, in particular the area around the [[Dnieper Rapids]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nAt the end of the 6th century BC, new funerary rites appeared, characterized by more complex kurgans. This new style was rapidly adopted throughout Scythian territory. Like before, elite burials usually contained horses. A buried king was usually accompanied with multiple people from his entourage. Burials containing both males and females are quite common both in elite burials and in the burials of the common people.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important Scythian kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture in the 6th and 5th centuries BC are Ostraya Tomakovskaya Mogila, Zavadskaya Mogila 1, Novogrigor\u2019evka 5, Baby and Raskopana Mogila in the Dnieper Rapids, and the Zolotoi and Kulakovski\u012d kurgans in the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe greatest, so-called \"royal\" kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture are dated to the 4th century BC. These include [[Solokha]], [[:uk:\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430|Bol\u2019shaya Cymbalka]], [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043b\u044b\u043a (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Chertomlyk]], [[:uk:\u041e\u0433\u0443\u0437 (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Oguz]], [[:ru:\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Alexandropol]], and [[:uk:\u041a\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043b (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Kozel]].

These include several unusually rich burials such as [[Kul-Oba]] (near [[Panticapaeum]] in the Crimea) and the necropolis of [[Nymphaion (Crimea)|Nymphaion]]. The sites probably represent Scythian aristocrats who had close ties, if not family ties, with the elite of Nymphaion and aristocrats, perhaps even royals, of the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn total, more than 3,000 Scythian funerary sites from the 4th century BC have been discovered on the Pontic steppe. This number far exceeds the number of all funerary sites from previous centuries.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from funerary sites, remains of Scythian cities from this period have been discovered. These include both continuations from the Early Scythian period and newly founded settlements. The most important of these is the settlement of [[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Kamenskoe]] on the Dniepr, which existed from the 5th century to the beginning of the 3rd century BC. It was a fortified settlement occupying an area of 12 square km. The chief occupation of its inhabitants appears to have been metalworking, and the city was probably an important supplier of metalwork for the nomadic Scythians. Part of the population was probably composed of agriculturalists. It is likely that Kamenskoe also served as a political center in Scythia. A significant part of Kamenskoe was not built up, perhaps to set it aside for the Scythian king and his entourage during their seasonal visits to the city.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> [[J\u00e1nos Harmatta]] suggests that Kamenskoe served as a residence for the Scythian king Ateas.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nBy the 4th century it appears that some of the Scythians were adopting an agricultural way of life similar to the peoples of the forest steppes. As result, a number of fortified and non-fortified settlements spring up in the areas of the lower Dnieper. Part of the settled inhabitants of Olbia were also of Scythian origin.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nClassical Scythian culture lasts until the late 4th century or early 3rd century BC.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Late Scythian===\n[[File:Simferopol, Scythian Neapolis, 2016.06.17 (04) (29608182661).jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Remains of [[Scythian Neapolis]] near modern-day [[Simferopol]], Crimea.

This area was at the time mostly settled by Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nArchaeologically the Late Scythian culture has little in common with its predecessors. It represents a fusion of Scythian traditions with those of the Greek colonists and the [[Tauri]], who inhabited the mountains of the Crimea. The population of the Late Scythian culture was mainly settled, and were engaged in stockbreeding and agriculture. They were also important traders, serving as intermediaries between the [[classical world]] and the [[barbarian]] world.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nRecent excavations at [[:ru:\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe]] implies that this site was the political center of the Scythians in the 3rd century BC and the early part of the 2nd century BC. It was a well protected fortress constructed in accordance with Greek principles.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important site of the Late Crimean culture is Scythian Neaoplis, which was located in Crimea and served as the capital of the Late Scythian kingdom from the early 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 3rd century AD. Scythian Neapolis was largely constructed in accordance with Greek principles. Its royal palace was destroyed by [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]], a general of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], at the end of the 2nd century BC, and was not rebuilt. The city nevertheless continued to exist as a major urban center. It underwent significant change from the 1st century to the 2nd century AD, eventually being left with virtually no buildings except from its fortifications. New funerary rites and material features also appear. It is probable that these changes represent the assimilation of the Scythians by the Sarmatians. A certain continuity is however observable. From the end of the 2nd century to the middle of the 3rd century AD, Scythian Neapolis transforms into a non-fortified settlement containing only a few buildings.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from Scythian Neapolis and Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe, more than 100 fortified and non-fortified settlements from the Late Scythian culture have been discovered. They are often accompanied by a necropolis. Late Scythian sites are mostly found in areas around the foothills of the Crimean mountains and along the western coast of the Crimea. Some of these settlements had earlier been Greek settlements, such as [[Kalos Limen]] and [[Kerkinitis]]. Many of these coastal settlements served as trading ports.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe largest Scythian settlements after Neapolis and Ak-Kaya-Vishennoe were [[:ru:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d\u043e (\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c)|Bulganak]], [[:ru:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u0410\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ust-Alma]], and [[:ru:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u041a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d-\u041a\u044b\u0440|Kermen-Kyr]].

The material culture of these settlements was even more Hellenized than those on the Crimea, and they were probably closely connected to Olbia, if not dependent it.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBurials of the Late Scythian culture can be divided into two kurgans and necropolises, with necropolises becoming more and more common as time progresses. The largest such necropolis has been found at Ust-Alma.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBecause of close similarities between the material culture of the Late Scythians and that of neighboring Greek cities, many scholars have suggested that Late Scythian cites, particularly those of the Lower Dnieper, were populated at last partly by Greeks.

With great mobility, the Scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry, just retreating into the steppes. Such tactics wore down their enemies, making them easier to defeat. The Scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors. Ruled by small numbers of closely allied elites, Scythians had a reputation for their [[Archery|archers]], and many gained employment as [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Scythian elites had [[kurgan]] tombs: high barrows heaped over chamber-tombs of [[larch]] wood, a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life-renewal, for it stands bare in winter.\n\nThe [[Ziwiye hoard]], a treasure of gold and silver metalwork and ivory found near the town of [[Sakiz]] south of [[Lake Urmia]] and dated to between 680 and 625 BC, includes objects with Scythian \"[[animal style]]\" features. One silver dish from this find bears some inscriptions, as yet undeciphered and so possibly representing a form of Scythian writing.\n\nScythians also had a reputation for the use of barbed and poisoned arrows of several types, for a [[nomadic]] life centred on horses \u2013 \"fed from horse-blood\" according to Herodotus \u2013 and for skill in [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSome Scythian-Sarmatian cultures may have given rise to Greek stories of [[Amazons]]. Graves of armed females have been found in southern Ukraine and Russia. [[David W. Anthony|David Anthony]] notes, \"About 20% of Scythian-Sarmatian 'warrior graves' on the lower Don and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were men, a style that may have inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\"<ref name=\"Anthony_329\">{{harvnb|Anthony|2010|p=329}}</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Scythian Warriors.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Scythian warriors, drawn after figures on an [[electrum]] cup from the [[Kul-Oba]] [[kurgan]] burial near [[Kerch]], Crimea.

The shield of the central figure may be made of plain leather over a wooden or wicker base. ([[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg)]]\nAccording to Herodotus, Scythian costume consisted of padded and quilted leather trousers tucked into boots, and open tunics. They rode without [[stirrups]] or saddles, using only saddle-cloths. Herodotus reports that Scythians used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], both to weave their clothing and to cleanse themselves in its smoke (Hist. 4.73\u201375); archaeology has confirmed the use of cannabis in funerary rituals. Men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear \u2013 either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap.\n\nWomen wore a variety of different headdresses, some conical in shape others more like flattened cylinders, also adorned with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nScythian women wore long, loose robes, ornamented with metal plaques (gold). Women wore shawls, often richly decorated with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nBased on numerous archeological findings in Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan, men and warrior women wore long sleeve tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts.\n\nMen and women wore long trousers, often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt appliqu\u00e9s; trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area. Materials used depended on the wealth, climate, and necessity.\n\nMen and women warriors wore variations of long and shorter boots, wool-leather-felt gaiter-boots, and moccasin-like shoes. They were either of a laced or simple slip on type.\nWomen wore also soft shoes with metal (gold) plaques.\n\nMen and women wore belts. Warrior belts were made of leather, often with gold or other metal adornments and had many attached leather thongs for fastening of the owner's [[gorytos]], sword, whet stone, whip etc. Belts were fastened with metal or horn [[belt hook|belt-hooks]], leather thongs, and metal (often golden) or horn belt-plates.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Scythian religion}}\n[[Scythian religion]] was a type of [[Ancient Iranian religion|Pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion]] and differed from the post-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Iranian thoughts.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\">{{harvnb|Harmatta|1996|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> The Scythian belief was a more archaic stage than the Zoroastrian and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] systems. The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nOur most important literary source on Scythian religion is Herodotus. According to him the leading deity in the Scythian pantheon was [[Tabiti]], whom he compared to the Greek god [[Hestia]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Tabiti was eventually replaced by [[Atar]], the fire-pantheon of Iranian tribes, and [[Agni]], the fire deity of [[Indo-Aryans]].<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>  Other deities mentioned by Herodotus include Papaios, Api, Goitosyros/Oitosyros, Argimpasa, and Thagimasadas, whom he identified with [[Zeus]], [[Gaia]], [[Apollo]], [[Aphrodite]], and [[Poseidon]] respectively. The Scythians are also said by Herodotus to have worshipped equivalents of [[Heracles]] and [[Ares]], but he does not mention their Scythian names.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> An additional Scythian deity, the goddess Dithagoia, is mentioned in the a dedication by Senamotis, daughter of King Skiluros, at Panticapaeum. Most of the names of Scythian deities can be traced back to Iranian roots.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nHerodotus states that Thagimasadas was worshipped by the Royal Scythians only, while the remaining deities were worshipped by all. He also states that \"Ares\", the god of war, was the only god to whom the Scythians dedicated statues, altars or temples. [[Tumuli]] were erected to him in every Scythian district, and both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices were performed in honor of him. At least one shrine to \"Ares\" has been discovered by archaeologists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Scythians had professional priests, but it is not known is they constituted a heridetary class. Among the priests there was a separate group, the [[Enarei]], who worshipped the goddess [[Argimpasa]] and assumed feminine identities.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the \"First Man\", who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings. Similar myths are common among other Iranian peoples. Considerable importance was given to the division of Scythian society into three hereditary classes, which consisted of warriors, priests, and producers. Kings were considered part of the warrior class. Royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> The Iranian principle of royal charisma, known as [[khvarenah]] in the [[Avesta]], played a prominent role in Scythian society. It is probable that the Scythians had a number of epic legends, which were possibly the source for Herodotus writings on them.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Traces of these epics can be found in the epics of the Ossetians of the present day.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nIn Scythian cosmology the world was divided into three parts, with the warriors, considered part of the upper world, the priests of the middle level, and the producers of the lower one.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Scythian art}}\n[[File:Placca pantera, da regione di krasnodar, kurgan chertomlyk, oro a sbalzo e cesellato, fine VII sec ac..JPG|thumb|Gold plaque with panther, probably for a shield or breast-plate, 13 in/33 cm long, end 7th-century BC]]\n[[File:Scythian comb.jpg|thumb|Scythian comb from [[Solokha]], early 4th century BC]]\nThe art of the Scythians and related peoples of the Scythian cultures is known as [[Scythian art]]. It is particularly characterized by its use of the [[animal style]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style appears in an already established form Eastern Europe in the 8th century BC along with the Early Scythian archaeological culture itself. It bears little resemblance to the art of pre-Scythian cultures of the area. Some scholars suggest the art style developed under Near Eastern influence during the military campaigns of the 7th century BC, but the more common theory is that it developed on the eastern part of the Eurasian Steppe under Chinese influence. Others have sought to reconcile the two theories, suggesting that the animal style of the west and eastern parts of the steppe developed independently of each other, under Near Eastern and Chinese influences respectively. Regardless, the animal style art of the Scythians differs considerable from that of peoples living further east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style works are typically divided into birds, ungulates, and beasts of prey. This probably reflects the tripatriate division of the Scythian cosmos, with birds belonging to the upper level, ungulates to the middle level, and beasts of prey in the lower level.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImages of mythological creatures such a [[griffin]]s are not uncommon in Scythian animal style, but these are probably the result of Near Eastern influences. By the late 6th century, as Scythian activity in the Near East was reduced, depictions of mythological creatures largely disappears from Scythian art. It however reappears again in the 4th century BC as a result of Greek influence.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Anthropomorphic]] depictions in Early Scythian art is known only from [[kurgan stelae]]. These depict warriors with almond-shaped eyes and mustaches, often including weapons and other military equipment.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nSince the 5th century BC, Scythian art changed considerably. This was probably a result of Greek and Persian influence, and possibly also internal developments caused by an arrival of a new nomadic people from the east. The changes are notable in the more realistic depictions of animals, who are now often depicted fighting each other rather than being depicted individually. Kurgan stelae of the time also display traces of Greek influences, with warriors being depicted with rounder eyes and full beards.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe 4th century BC show additional Greek influence. While animal style was still in use, it appears that much Scythian art by this point was being made by Greek craftsmen on behalf of Scythians. Such objects are frequently found in royal Scythian burials of the period. Depictions of human beings become more prevalent. Many objects of Scythian art made by Greeks are probably illustrations of Scythian legends. Several objects are believed to have been of religious significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBy the late 3rd century BC, original Scythian art disappears through ongoing Hellenization. The creation of anthropomorphic gravestones continued however.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nWorks of Scythian art are held at many museums and has been featured at many exhibitions. The largest collections of Scythian art are found at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and the Museum of Historical Treasures of the Ukraine in [[Kiev]], while smaller collections are found at the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] of [[Oxford]], and the [[Louvre]] of [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> \n\n=== Gender ===\nThe idea of gender was [[Gender-fluid|fluid]] in the Scythian culture. [[Barry Cunliffe]] says, \"[the idea] that gender boundaries were fluid among the Scythians is explicitly stated by various classical observers, most notably Herodotus and Pseudo-Hippocrates.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218; quote found in \"Further Reading\" section at the end of the book|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Women ====\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] (a people considered part of Scythian culture) women would ride on horseback; and they use a bow and throw [[Javelin|javelins]] from their horses. He continues by saying that the women would remain virgins until they could kill three of their enemies. Pseudo-Hippocrates also says that young girls would have their right [[breast]] [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to stop it from developing; this would help give the young warrior enhanced strength as an archer. Herodotus called these women Amazons (meaning \"without a breast,\" in Greek). Women had a prominent role in hunting and in battle, according to Herodotus. He also says that women would sometimes [[Cross-dressing|dress like men]]. According to Barry Cunliffe, these accounts confirm each other and they are partially supported by archaeological evidence. In the old Sarmatian territory, one fifth of the warrior burials, dating to the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, are female; and a fifth of female graves contain weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218\u201320; 123|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Men ====\n{{Main|Enaree}}\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that some Scythian men were [[Eunuch|eunuchs]], spoke like women, performed female work, and wore female attire. The Scythian men, according to Pseudo-Hippocrates, accepted their condition as the will of the gods\u2009\u2014\u2009however, Pseudo-Hippocrates rejects this explanation. He said that gender transfer was more common among the rich and elite. Herodotus also noted the effeminacy of some Scythian men. Herodotus says that the gods inflicted this \"female sickness\" upon them because they destroyed the temple of Venus in Ascalon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=219\u201320|language=en}}</ref> \n\nMale Scythian burials in [[Siberia]], dating back to the second and third centuries BCE, containing female decorations and utensils have been discovered.

The skeleton has been described as a 40-45 year old woman. The grave includes female cosmetic items, such as a bronze mirror, and it contains a [[cowrie shell]], which is often seen as a traditional [[vagina]] symbol. However, recent interpretations of the burial have suggested that \"the face is definitely masculine\" and that it is an Enaree.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Timothy|title=The Prehistory of Sex: Four Million Years of Human Sexual Culture|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1997|isbn=978-0553375275|location=|pages=214}}</ref>\n\nCharles Chiasson has pointed out that Pseudo-Hippocrates tries to display the cross dressers as the ruling class (Anarieis), who are \"aristocratic poster-boys for the effeminacy that he posits as a characteristic national trait\"; and Herodotus tries to represent the cross dressers (the Enaree, as they are called by Herodotus) as a marginalized group in a masculine warrior society\u2009\u2014\u2009he describes the cross dressing as a sickness inflicted on them by a foreign deity, thereby making their belief in [[androgyny]] foreign. According to Chiasson, Herodotus' portrayal of the Enaree is much more accurate than Pseudo-Hippocrates' portrayal of them as aristocrats. Chiasson suggests that the reason for Pseudo-Hippocrates' view of the Scythians is because of his theory of [[climatic determinism]], where the climate affects both the physical and psychological characteristics of people. For example, he claims that the variation of Europe's climate made Europeans more courageous, fiercer, and more warlike than Asians. Pseudo-Hippocrates says that the cold and moist climate that the Scythians lived in robbed them of their desire for sex and that their nomadic lifestyle robbed them of the strength for sex\u2009\u2014\u2009the nomadic lifestyle entails excessive horse riding and too much trouser wearing, which, according to Pseudo-Hippocrates, robs men of the strength to have sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiasson|first=Charles|date=2001|title=Scythian Androgyny and Environmental Determinism in Herodotus and the Hippocratic \u03c0\u03f5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03f5\u0301\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03b4\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u00f3\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd|journal=Syllecta Classica|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=33\u201373|doi=10.1353/syl.2001.0007|issn=2160-5157}}</ref> The scholar and archaeologist [[Ellis Minns]] said that Pseudo-Hippocrates may have been correct in asserting that constant horse riding caused the phenomenon.

She says that it is one of the elements of the [[Shamanism|shamanic]] complex. In the shamanic cultures of Northern Eurasia and Central Asia, the shamans who changed their sex were very powerful and scared laymen. Ustinova suggests that the sex transformation must have began late in their lives. She also says that the roots of the phenomenon must be ancient.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRachel Hart has concluded that both Pseudo-Hippocrates and Herodotus are describing the same tradition that is similar to the cross-cultural tradition of cross-dressing shamans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/148/abstract/neither-men-nor-women-failure-western-binary-systems|title=(N)either Men (n)or Women?

The ordinary people whom they dominated were of much smaller stature, averaging 4\u20136 in. (10-15 cm) below them in height. Skeletons of Scythian nobles differ from those of today by their longer arm and leg bones, and stronger bone formation. These physical characteristics affirm an Iranian origin.<ref name=\"Rolle_55\"/>\n\n==Genetics==\nIn 2017, a genetic study of various Scythian cultures, including the Scythians, was published in [[Nature Communications]]. The study suggested that the Scythians arose independently of culturally similar groups further east. Though all groups studies shared a common origin in the [[Yamnaya culture]], the presence of east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages was largely absent among Scythians, but present among other groups further east. Modern populations most closely related to the Scythians were found to be populations living in proximity to the sites studied, suggesting genetic continuity.<ref name=\"\u00dcnterlander\">{{cite journal |last1=Unterl\u00e4nder |first1=Martina |author-link1= |date=March 3, 2017 |orig-year= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |title=Ancestry and demography and descendants of Iron Age nomads of the Eurasian Steppe |trans-title= |department= |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |type= |series= |language= |edition= |publication-date= |volume= 8|issue= |pages= 14615|bibcode= |bibcode-access= |doi=10.1038/ncomms14615 |pmid=28256537 |pmc=5337992 |doi-access= |jstor= |quote=Greek and Persian historians of the 1st millennium BCE chronicle the existence of the Massagetae and Sauromatians, and later, the Sarmatians and Sacae: cultures possessing artefacts similar to those found in classical Scythian monuments, such as weapons, horse harnesses and a distinctive \u2018Animal Style' artistic tradition.

Significant genetic differences were found between the Scythians and materially similar groups further east, which underpinned the notion that although materially similar, the Scythians and groups further east should be seen as separate peoples belonging to a common cultural horizon, which perhaps had its source on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe and the southern [[Urals]].<ref name=\"Krzewi\u0144ska\"/>\n\nIn 2019, a genetic study of remains from the [[Aldy-Bel culture]] of southern Siberia, which is materially similar to that of the Scythians, was published in [[Human Genetics (journal)|Human Genetics]].

Some writers claim that Scythians figured in the formation of the empire of the [[Medes]] and likewise of [[Caucasian Albania]].\n\nThe Scythians also feature in some national origin-legends of the Celts. In the second paragraph of the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], the \u00e9lite of [[Scotland]] claim Scythia as a former homeland of the [[Scottish people|Scots]]. According to the 11th-century [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]] (''The Book of the Taking of [[Ireland]]''), the 14th-century [[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]] and other [[Irish folklore]], the [[Irish people|Irish]] originated in Scythia and were descendants of [[F\u00e9nius Farsaid]], a Scythian prince who created the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n\nThe [[Carolingian]] kings of the [[Franks]] traced [[Merovingian]] ancestry to the Germanic tribe of the [[Sicambri]]. [[Gregory of Tours]] documents in his ''History of the Franks'' that when [[Clovis I|Clovis]] was baptised, he was referred to as a Sicamber with the words \"Mitis depone colla, Sicamber, adora quod incendisti, incendi quod adorasti.\" The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] in turn reveals that the Franks believed the Sicambri to be a tribe of Scythian or Cimmerian descent, who had changed their name to [[Franks]] in honour of their chieftain Franco in 11 BC.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, foreigners regarded the [[Russians]] as descendants of Scythians. It became conventional to refer to Russians as Scythians in 18th-century poetry, and [[Alexander Blok]] drew on this tradition sarcastically in his last major poem, ''The Scythians'' (1920). In the 19th century, romantic revisionists in the West transformed the \"[[barbarian]]\" Scyths of literature into the wild and free, hardy and democratic ancestors of all blond [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].\n\nBased on such accounts of Scythian founders of certain Germanic as well as Celtic tribes, British historiography in the [[British Empire]] period such as [[Sharon Turner]] in his ''[[History of the Anglo-Saxons]]'', made them the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]].\n\n==Related ancient peoples==\nHerodotus and other classical historians listed quite a number of tribes who lived near the Scythians, and presumably shared the same general milieu and nomadic steppe culture, often called \"Scythian culture\", even though scholars may have difficulties in determining their exact relationship to the \"linguistic Scythians\".

Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br />Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man\u2019s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian \u00bb 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017|date=2008-11-26}}</ref>}}\n\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.\n\n''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly \u201cspeaking computer.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-books-fiction/the-early-life-of-the-word-cyberpunk/|title=The Early Life of the Word \"Cyberpunk\" - Neon Dystopia|date=13 November 2016|website=NeonDystopia.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAfterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article where he said \"About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic \u201cschool\u201d would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as \u201ccyberpunks\u201d \u2014 Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/12/30/science-fiction-in-the-eighties/526c3a06-f123-4668-9127-33e33f57e313/|title=Science Fiction in the Eighties|first=Gardner|last=Dozois|date=30 December 1984|publisher=|access-date=28 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>\n\nAbout that time in 1984, William Gibson's novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk \"virtual reality\", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called \"Neuromantics\", a pun on the name of the novel plus \"[[New Romantics]]\", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased [[Michael Swanwick]]'s argument for the term: \"the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation ''Neuromancer''\".\n\nSterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf|title=Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image|website=AthabascaU.ca|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called ''[[Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology]]'', an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2013/01/review-of-mirrorshades-cyberpunk.html|title=Speculiction...: Review of \"Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology\" Edited by Bruce Sterling|last=Jesse|date=27 January 2013|website=Speculiction.Blogspot.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' in 1992.\n\nBookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called ''[[Headcrash]]'', like ''Snow Crash'' a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIt satirized the genre in this way:\n{{quote|...full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements ... They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures.

Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously [[Steampunk]], but also a host of other [[Cyberpunk derivatives]].\n\n== Style and ethos ==\nPrimary figures in the cyberpunk movement include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Bruce Bethke]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]]. [[Philip K.

The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the [[World Wide Web]] entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as [[Arthur C.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''.

The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture.

Talsorian Games]], and ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as a module of the [[GURPS]] family of RPGs. ''Cyberpunk 2020'' was designed with the settings of William Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, unlike the approach taken by [[FASA Corporation|FASA]] in producing the transgenre ''[[Shadowrun]]'' game.

All published editions of ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' have a tagline on the front cover, which reads \"The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!\" Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.\n\nCyberpunk has also inspired several [[tabletop game|tabletop]], [[miniature wargaming|miniature]] and [[board game]]s such as ''[[Necromunda]]'' by [[Games Workshop]]. ''[[Netrunner]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] introduced in 1996, based on the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' role-playing game.

Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. \n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk. The former has been interpreted as a dystopian<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/exo-mw0002387718 | title=Exo - Gatekeeper | website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=January 3, 2015 | author=Ham, Robert}}</ref> critique of [[capitalism]]<ref name=\"stylus1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stylus.com/hzwtls | title=Vaporwave: Soundtrack to Austerity | publisher=Stylus.com | date=January 29, 2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2014 | author=Ward, Christian}}</ref> in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter as a nostalgic [[retrofuturistic]] revival of aspects of cyberpunk's origins.\n\n== Social impact ==\n=== Art and architecture ===\n{{Commons category-inline|Cyberpunk cityscapes}}\n\n[[File:SonyCenterAtNight.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[Berlin]]'s [[Sony Center]]]]\n\nSome [[Neo-Futurism]] artworks and cityscapes have been influenced by cyberpunk, such as<ref name=\"cyberpunk1\"/> the [[Sony Center]] in the [[Potsdamer Platz]] [[public square]] of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Suzuki |first=David |authorlink=David Suzuki |title=Good News for a Change:How Everyday People Are Helping the Planet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbvpz6NaZC8C&pg=PA332 |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2003 |page=332 |isbn=1-55054-926-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Society and counterculture ===\nSeveral subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like \"tech wear\", \"goth ninja\" or \"tech ninja\". Important designers in this type of fashion{{According to whom|date=January 2015}} are ACRONYM, Demobaza,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.demobaza.com/ |title=Online Store |publisher=Demobaza |date= |accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> [[Boris Bidjan Saberi]], [[Rick Owens]] and [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]].\n\nThe [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[Hong Kong]] (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-new-look-at-kowloon-walled-city-the-internets-favorite-cyberpunk-slum|title=A New Look at Kowloon Walled City, the Internet's Favorite Cyberpunk Slum|publisher=|date=2014-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Related genres ===\n{{See also|Cyberpunk derivatives}}\nAs a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.

Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br />Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom.

Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.\n\n''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly \u201cspeaking computer.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-books-fiction/the-early-life-of-the-word-cyberpunk/|title=The Early Life of the Word \"Cyberpunk\" - Neon Dystopia|date=13 November 2016|website=NeonDystopia.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAfterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article where he said \"About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic \u201cschool\u201d would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as \u201ccyberpunks\u201d \u2014 Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/12/30/science-fiction-in-the-eighties/526c3a06-f123-4668-9127-33e33f57e313/|title=Science Fiction in the Eighties|first=Gardner|last=Dozois|date=30 December 1984|publisher=|access-date=28 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>\n\nAbout that time in 1984, William Gibson's novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk \"virtual reality\", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called \"Neuromantics\", a pun on the name of the novel plus \"[[New Romantics]]\", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased [[Michael Swanwick]]'s argument for the term: \"the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation ''Neuromancer''\".\n\nSterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf|title=Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image|website=AthabascaU.ca|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called ''[[Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology]]'', an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2013/01/review-of-mirrorshades-cyberpunk.html|title=Speculiction...: Review of \"Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology\" Edited by Bruce Sterling|last=Jesse|date=27 January 2013|website=Speculiction.Blogspot.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' in 1992.\n\nBookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called ''[[Headcrash]]'', like ''Snow Crash'' a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIt satirized the genre in this way:\n{{quote|...full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements ... They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures.

Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously [[Steampunk]], but also a host of other [[Cyberpunk derivatives]].\n\n== Style and ethos ==\nPrimary figures in the cyberpunk movement include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Bruce Bethke]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]]. [[Philip K.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''.

In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's ''Neuromancer,'' whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture.

Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]].

[[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. \n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk.

These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like \"tech wear\", \"goth ninja\" or \"tech ninja\". Important designers in this type of fashion{{According to whom|date=January 2015}} are ACRONYM, Demobaza,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.demobaza.com/ |title=Online Store |publisher=Demobaza |date= |accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> [[Boris Bidjan Saberi]], [[Rick Owens]] and [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]].\n\nThe [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[Hong Kong]] (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-new-look-at-kowloon-walled-city-the-internets-favorite-cyberpunk-slum|title=A New Look at Kowloon Walled City, the Internet's Favorite Cyberpunk Slum|publisher=|date=2014-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Related genres ===\n{{See also|Cyberpunk derivatives}}\nAs a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well-situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.

The planning area is bordered by [[Bedok]] and [[Paya Lebar]] to the west, [[Pasir Ris]] to the north, [[Changi]] to the east and the [[Singapore Straits]] to the south. Tampines [[Planned community#Singapore|New Town]] is located in the northern portion of Tampines planning area. Tampines is the third largest new town in Singapore by area, covering over 2089 hectares of land and also is the third most populated new town, following [[Bedok]] and [[Jurong West]]. It is the [[Regional centre (Singapore)|regional centre]] for the East Region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tampines Avenue 10 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Avenue 10]]\n[[File:Tampines HDB 10.JPG|thumb|200px|Apartment blocks in Tampines Town]]\nIn the past, Tampines was covered by forests, swamp and sand quarries. [[Ironwood]] trees, or ''tempinis'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], grew abundantly. The area was part of a military training area until about 1987.\n\nThe name Tampines goes back to the Franklin and Jackson map of 1828. It is named after [[Sungei Tampines]], which in turn got its name from the ''tempinis'' trees ([[Malay language|Malay]] for ''[[Streblus elongatus]]'') which were said to be growing by it.\n\nThe oldest street in the area, Tampines Road, dates to 1864 when it was a cart tract. At the turn of the 20th century, Tampines was a rubber plantation. Tampines was also home to the sand quarry for a long time. Among the plantations were Teo Tek Ho and Hun Yeang estates.\n\nThe new town started in 1978. Construction began for Neighbourhoods 1 and 2 and was completed between 1983 and 1987 although they were given priority. Neighbourhoods 8 and 9 started in 1985\u20131989, followed by Neighbourhood 5 which was completed in 1989 with the Tampines Town Centre. Neighbourhood 4 was completed with the new Tampines North Division between 1986 and 1988. Tampines Town was at the fast-paced expansion, that breaks it into Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North and Tampines Changkat divisions.\n\nFor the Singapore MRT plans, they showed \"Tampines North\" and \"Tampines South\" since the planning stages which is due to the similar townships from 1979 to 1982, before they were renamed respectively in 1985 to Tampines and [[Simei]].\n\nNew construction methods expedited the development of the town's infrastructure. More attractive designs, colours and finishings were incorporated into Tampines, compared to earlier public housing which consisted of uniform slabs of concrete laid out row after row with more thought given to function than form. The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form for the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tampines |url=https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tampines |website=Housing and Development Board |publisher=Housing and Development Board |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref> The [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) managed the construction of the town until 1991, when it handed the reins over to the Tampines Town Council. The Town Council is run by [[grassroot]] leaders and the residents themselves.\n\nThe Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the [[World Habitat Awards|World Habitat Award]] to Tampines, which was selected as a representative of Singapore's [[new towns]], on 5 October 1992. The award was given in recognition of an outstanding contribution towards human [[colonization|settlement]] and development.\n\nNeighbourhoods 3 and 7 were only fully completed in 1997, and the constituencies had been reformed to include the new Tampines Central division. Construction was paused until the developments of Tampines Central were started in 2010, which includes The Premiere @ Tampines, Tampines GreenLeaf, Centrale 8, Tampines Trilliant and Citylife @ Tampines, including some of the other leftover pockets of residential developments such as Tampines GreenTerrace, Arc @ Tampines, Q Bay Residences and The Santorini.\n\nNeighbourhood 6, which is also known as Tampines North New Town, has started construction with the first [[Build to order (HDB)|Build-To-Order]] (BTO) flats Tampines GreenRidges being announced at the end of November 2014. Tampines GreenRidges is also part of the first phase of development of the Tampines North New Town's Park West District, which is the first district to be constructed in the Tampines North New Town development.\n\nTampines Court<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-court-sold-en-bloc-for-970m/ Tampines Court En Bloc]</ref>, had been en-bloc since July 2017 and all residents vacated their premises by 12 December 2018.

Thus, an array of facilities are provided primarily for residents in the new towns. Tampines is one of Singapore's four regional centres (along with [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Jurong East]] and future [[Seletar]]), under the plan of the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. As a result, the Tampines Regional Centre serves the Tampines residents and the entire [[East Region, Singapore|East Region]].\n\n===Commercial services===\n[[File:Tampines Mall 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Mall]]\n[[File:IKEA Tampines 42.JPG|thumb|200px|IKEA Tampines]]\nRetail [[shopping]] in the Tampines Regional Centre is done at three main shopping malls: [[Tampines Mall]], [[Century Square]] and [[Tampines 1]].

All of the parks are close to each other and interconnected by a walking and bicycle path..\n\nThe other parks in Tampines Town are mainly community parks\u2013 Tampines North Park, Tampines Leisure Park, Tampines Central Park, Tampines Park, Festival Park, Tampines Green, Tampines Tree Garden, and some neighbourhood parks. Occasionally, community-related events are held at Festival Park.\n\nThere's also another unofficial park in Tampines Town, it is Tampines Quarry Park, which originally was a sand quarry. As time passed, rain water filled the quarry. It is the only park in Tampines that is not equipped with any facilities, but this park is still popular among residents living nearby. There are no signs to the park and there is no entrance as it is hidden among the greenery. There are hidden pathways to enter.\n\nIn future, there will be mainly 2 new main parks in Tampines Town, namely Tampines Boulevard Park and Tampines North Quarry Park which will be located at the future Tampines North New Town. There will also be more new neighbourhood parks added in the future in both Tampines Town and Tampines North New Town together with the developments in the area.\n\n===Our Tampines Hub===\nThe [[Our Tampines Hub]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1106058/1/.html|title=Tampines to have Town Hub by 2015|accessdate=21 January 2011|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tampines-new-town-hub-to/2086428.html|title=Tampines New Town Hub to open progressively from end-2016|last=Chan|first=Luo Er|date=2015-08-30|publisher=Channel News Asia|accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> is a new development in Tampines. Construction began in June 2013 and it opened on 9 November 2016. It is located at [[Tampines Stadium]] along Avenue 4 and 5, together with the swimming pool.\n\nIt is built for the residents of Tampines and provides a community space where residents can gather, interact and bond with others from the community. Facilities available include a community centre, sports and recreation centres, swimming pools, bowling alleys, karaoke facility, information centres and several offices. The Tampines Regional Library was also relocated here.\n\n==Politics==\nOriginally, Tampines was under the [[Tampines Single Member Constituency]] when it was still under development up until 1988, where its population was grown and made into [[Tampines Group Representation Constituency]]. The [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]] (and later [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] in the 2001 and 2006 elections) had always contested in the town in all the general elections except in 1997, when the party was disqualified, but the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won in every election they contested. \n\nSince 2015, Tampines was divided into four [[Group Representation Constituencies]], namely the namesake [[Tampines GRC|Tampines]] (central and regional centre), [[Aljunied GRC|Aljunied]] ([[Bedok Reservoir]] and [[Temasek Polytechnic]]), [[East Coast GRC|East Coast]] (the subregion of [[Simei]]) and [[Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC|Pasir Ris-Punggol]] (northernmost region, including IKEA and Giant hypermarket). Tampines was led by the PAP, among which the MPs include [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime]] and [[Minister for Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Heng Swee Keat]] and by [[Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources|Minister of the Environment and Water Resources]] and [[Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs|Muslim Affairs]] [[Masagos Zulkifli]], with the exception of Aljunied being led by the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Tampines MRT.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Tampines MRT station]]]]<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-mrt-stations]</ref>\n\n===Road network===\nA network of [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], namely the [[Pan-Island Expressway]], [[East Coast Parkway]] and [[Tampines Expressway]], and arterial roads allows easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the island. Tampines Avenue 10, an arterial road, forms the start/end of the [[Outer Ring Road System]], a semi-expressway.\n\n===Mass rapid transit===\nThere are currently 6 [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] stations that serve the planning area across 2 lines, the [[East West MRT Line|East West Line]] and [[Downtown MRT Line|Downtown Line]]. Both lines have two interchange stations at [[Tampines MRT station]] and [[Expo MRT station]] on the Changi Airport Branch line. The stations of the Downtown Line  were opened on 21 October 2017 as part of DTL3.

The planning area is bordered by [[Bedok]] and [[Paya Lebar]] to the west, [[Pasir Ris]] to the north, [[Changi]] to the east and the [[Singapore Straits]] to the south. Tampines [[Planned community#Singapore|New Town]] is located in the northern portion of Tampines planning area. Tampines is the third largest new town in Singapore by area, covering over 2089 hectares of land and also is the third most populated new town, following [[Bedok]] and [[Jurong West]]. It is the [[Regional centre (Singapore)|regional centre]] for the East Region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tampines Avenue 10 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Avenue 10]]\n[[File:Tampines HDB 10.JPG|thumb|200px|Apartment blocks in Tampines Town]]\nIn the past, Tampines was covered by forests, swamp and sand quarries. [[Ironwood]] trees, or ''tempinis'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], grew abundantly. The area was part of a military training area until about 1987.\n\nThe name Tampines goes back to the Franklin and Jackson map of 1828. It is named after [[Sungei Tampines]], which in turn got its name from the ''tempinis'' trees ([[Malay language|Malay]] for ''[[Streblus elongatus]]'') which were said to be growing by it.\n\nThe oldest street in the area, Tampines Road, dates to 1864 when it was a cart tract. At the turn of the 20th century, Tampines was a rubber plantation. Tampines was also home to the sand quarry for a long time. Among the plantations were Teo Tek Ho and Hun Yeang estates.\n\nThe new town started in 1978. Construction began for Neighbourhoods 1 and 2 and was completed between 1983 and 1987 although they were given priority. Neighbourhoods 8 and 9 started in 1985\u20131989, followed by Neighbourhood 5 which was completed in 1989 with the Tampines Town Centre. Neighbourhood 4 was completed with the new Tampines North Division between 1986 and 1988. Tampines Town was at the fast-paced expansion, that breaks it into Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North and Tampines Changkat divisions.\n\nFor the Singapore MRT plans, they showed \"Tampines North\" and \"Tampines South\" since the planning stages which is due to the similar townships from 1979 to 1982, before they were renamed respectively in 1985 to Tampines and [[Simei]].\n\nNew construction methods expedited the development of the town's infrastructure. More attractive designs, colours and finishings were incorporated into Tampines, compared to earlier public housing which consisted of uniform slabs of concrete laid out row after row with more thought given to function than form. The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form for the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tampines |url=https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tampines |website=Housing and Development Board |publisher=Housing and Development Board |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref> The [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) managed the construction of the town until 1991, when it handed the reins over to the Tampines Town Council. The Town Council is run by [[grassroot]] leaders and the residents themselves.\n\nThe Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the [[World Habitat Awards|World Habitat Award]] to Tampines, which was selected as a representative of Singapore's [[new towns]], on 5 October 1992. The award was given in recognition of an outstanding contribution towards human [[colonization|settlement]] and development.\n\nNeighbourhoods 3 and 7 were only fully completed in 1997, and the constituencies had been reformed to include the new Tampines Central division. Construction was paused until the developments of Tampines Central were started in 2010, which includes The Premiere @ Tampines, Tampines GreenLeaf, Centrale 8, Tampines Trilliant and Citylife @ Tampines, including some of the other leftover pockets of residential developments such as Tampines GreenTerrace, Arc @ Tampines, Q Bay Residences and The Santorini.\n\nNeighbourhood 6, which is also known as Tampines North New Town, has started construction with the first [[Build to order (HDB)|Build-To-Order]] (BTO) flats Tampines GreenRidges being announced at the end of November 2014. Tampines GreenRidges is also part of the first phase of development of the Tampines North New Town's Park West District, which is the first district to be constructed in the Tampines North New Town development.\n\nTampines Court<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-court-sold-en-bloc-for-970m/ Tampines Court En Bloc]</ref>, had been en-bloc since July 2017 and all residents vacated their premises by 12 December 2018.

Thus, an array of facilities are provided primarily for residents in the new towns. Tampines is one of Singapore's four regional centres (along with [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Jurong East]] and future [[Seletar]]), under the plan of the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. As a result, the Tampines Regional Centre serves the Tampines residents and the entire [[East Region, Singapore|East Region]].\n\n===Commercial services===\n[[File:Tampines Mall 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Mall]]\n[[File:IKEA Tampines 42.JPG|thumb|200px|IKEA Tampines]]\nRetail [[shopping]] in the Tampines Regional Centre is done at three main shopping malls: [[Tampines Mall]], [[Century Square]] and [[Tampines 1]].

Occasionally, community-related events are held at Festival Park.\n\nThere's also another unofficial park in Tampines Town, it is Tampines Quarry Park, which originally was a sand quarry. As time passed, rain water filled the quarry. It is the only park in Tampines that is not equipped with any facilities, but this park is still popular among residents living nearby. There are no signs to the park and there is no entrance as it is hidden among the greenery. There are hidden pathways to enter.\n\nIn future, there will be mainly 2 new main parks in Tampines Town, namely Tampines Boulevard Park and Tampines North Quarry Park which will be located at the future Tampines North New Town. There will also be more new neighbourhood parks added in the future in both Tampines Town and Tampines North New Town together with the developments in the area.\n\n===Our Tampines Hub===\nThe [[Our Tampines Hub]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1106058/1/.html|title=Tampines to have Town Hub by 2015|accessdate=21 January 2011|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tampines-new-town-hub-to/2086428.html|title=Tampines New Town Hub to open progressively from end-2016|last=Chan|first=Luo Er|date=2015-08-30|publisher=Channel News Asia|accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> is a new development in Tampines.

Facilities available include a community centre, sports and recreation centres, swimming pools, bowling alleys, karaoke facility, information centres and several offices. The Tampines Regional Library was also relocated here.\n\n==Politics==\nOriginally, Tampines was under the [[Tampines Single Member Constituency]] when it was still under development up until 1988, where its population was grown and made into [[Tampines Group Representation Constituency]]. The [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]] (and later [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] in the 2001 and 2006 elections) had always contested in the town in all the general elections except in 1997, when the party was disqualified, but the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won in every election they contested. \n\nSince 2015, Tampines was divided into four [[Group Representation Constituencies]], namely the namesake [[Tampines GRC|Tampines]] (central and regional centre), [[Aljunied GRC|Aljunied]] ([[Bedok Reservoir]] and [[Temasek Polytechnic]]), [[East Coast GRC|East Coast]] (the subregion of [[Simei]]) and [[Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC|Pasir Ris-Punggol]] (northernmost region, including IKEA and Giant hypermarket). Tampines was led by the PAP, among which the MPs include [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime]] and [[Minister for Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Heng Swee Keat]] and by [[Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources|Minister of the Environment and Water Resources]] and [[Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs|Muslim Affairs]] [[Masagos Zulkifli]], with the exception of Aljunied being led by the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Tampines MRT.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Tampines MRT station]]]]<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-mrt-stations]</ref>\n\n===Road network===\nA network of [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], namely the [[Pan-Island Expressway]], [[East Coast Parkway]] and [[Tampines Expressway]], and arterial roads allows easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the island. Tampines Avenue 10, an arterial road, forms the start/end of the [[Outer Ring Road System]], a semi-expressway.\n\n===Mass rapid transit===\nThere are currently 6 [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] stations that serve the planning area across 2 lines, the [[East West MRT Line|East West Line]] and [[Downtown MRT Line|Downtown Line]]. Both lines have two interchange stations at [[Tampines MRT station]] and [[Expo MRT station]] on the Changi Airport Branch line. The stations of the Downtown Line  were opened on 21 October 2017 as part of DTL3. The 6 stations are:\n\n*{{SMRT code 2I/C|EW|2|DT|32}} [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]]\n*{{SMRT code|EW|3}} [[Simei MRT station|Simei]]\n*{{SMRT code|DT|31}} [[Tampines West MRT station|Tampines West]]\n*{{SMRT code|DT|33}} [[Tampines East MRT station|Tampines East]]\n*{{SMRT code|DT|34}} [[Upper Changi MRT station|Upper Changi]]\n*{{SMRT code 2I/C|DT|35|CG|1}} [[Expo MRT station|Expo]]\n\n[[Xilin MRT station|Xilin MRT Station]] will be a future station as part of DTL3 extension, will be completed in 2024 in tandem with the opening of the Stage 4 of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson-East Coast Line]].\n\n[[Tampines North MRT station|Tampines North MRT Station]] will be the newest future station added to Tampines.

Tampines Bus Interchange has been operating since 1983 as a bus terminus and later on it moved to Tampines Central 1 in 1987. Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange was opened on 18 December 2016 to increase the capacity of the existing Tampines Bus Interchange.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.todayonline.com/singapore/sengkang-and-tampines-bus-interchanges-be-expanded |title=Sengkang and Tampines bus interchanges to be expanded |accessdate=25 Nov 2014|publisher=[[Today Online]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange| url=http://landtransportguru.net/tampines-concourse-bus-interchange/| website=Land Transport Guru| accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> \n\nA third bus interchange, Tampines North Bus Interchange, is currently under planning and will be part of the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://landtransportguru.net/tampines-north-bus-interchange/|title=Tampines North Bus Interchange {{!}} Land Transport Guru|date=2017-03-01|work=Land Transport Guru|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Changi Business Park#Changi Business Park Bus Terminal|Changi Business Park Bus Terminal]] is a bus terminal in the northern part of Changi Business Park.
