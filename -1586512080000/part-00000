The stadium is part of a sport center, which since 2007 has also consisted of a multi-purpose hall named Spar Nord Arena, while the stadium itself includes [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] certified athletics and sports facilities such as six round lanes, eight straight lanes, starting blocks, electronic timing, two tracks for the [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]],

(2018).\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the [[List of football stadiums in Denmark|stadium]] at Engvej broke ground in May 1941, with the last details coming into place in the spring of 1943, and the new stadium was finished in 1944 at a total cost of DKK 130,000.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As part of the agreement between [[Skive IK]] and [[Skive Municipality]], a new club house was built at the ground at a cost of DKK 12,000 and the club officially moved to Engvej in the spring of 1944.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> The stadium, with a total area of 9.5 [[barrel of land|barrels of land]] located at the [[meadow]] referred as ''Rosens Eng'' next to Karup River, consisted of an exhibition field with athletics courses, two training fields and four tennis courts.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> In the years leading up to the construction of the stadium, the meadow had already been filled up by the municipality as relief work for the unemployed.<ref name=\"drkis\" /> The inauguration of the stadium at Engvej took place on 5 June 1944 ([[Constitution Day (Denmark)|Constitution Day]]) with a programme consisting of a large athletics event with participation of many of the country's strongest athletes and an [[association football]] match in front of nearly 4,000 [[Audience|spectators]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /> Skive IK, participating in the 1943\u201344 JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke, lost their association football match against the best placed [[Jutland]]ish league team in the [[1943\u201344 Danish War Tournament|1943\u201344 season]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /> Arbejdernes Idr\u00e6tsforening (AIF), which was the competing sports team in the city, had their own inauguration of the stadium on 18 June 1944 with music, singing and association football, and their first team in the JBU's Mellemr\u00e6kke played an exhibition match against the local rivals [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] from the JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke.<ref name=\"sik100\" />\n\nThe City Council of [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]] made a unanimous decision on 12 June 1944 to prohibit the presence of non-paying [[audience|spectators]] at the north lying [[hill]]side, with the residence of the Skive Museum, during association football matches.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> Proposed by the then Street and Road Committee, the ban was meant to discourage potential ''free riders'' from viewing the matches from outside that stadium's gates, which could cost revenue for Skive IK and Skive Municipality.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> However, the local [[police]] have never enforced the ban nor spend resources on it, which have not had any significant impact.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> In the spring of 1945, the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupying forces]] seizes the stadium facilities and on 8 May 1945 a large parade was held by the [[Danish resistance movement]].<ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /> Although the construction of a covered spectator stand had to be abandoned due to the stringent rationing of building material during [[World War II]], it was finally built starting from the summer of 1965 to spring 1966 using voluntary labor and with partial financial support from Skive Municipality for the [[building material]]s, and was attached to Skive IK's new club member's house next to the football field \u2014 the house was inaugurated on 28 March 1966.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /><ref name=\"djfh-m\u00e5\" />\n\nThe stadium holds 10,000 people of which 523 are seated at the covered grandstand in the south west side.<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /> The stadium's record attendance was recorded on 19 May 1955 ([[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]]), when sold-out stadium crowd of nearly 10,000 spectators watched the last decisive league match in the [[1954\u201355 Jutland Series]] between the two highest placed teams in the northern division, Skive IK and local rivals [[Viborg FF]], competing for the division title and hence a spot in the [[Jutland Series|1954\u201355 Jutland Championship]] Final and qualification for the [[1954\u201355 Kvalifikationsturneringen]] (popularly known as the ''Danish 4th Division'').<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The [[Danish football league system|level 4]] league match, that Viborg FF won 3\u20132 in windy rain, is reportedly the largest match attendance to a lower ranking Danish league game, outside of the top three divisional structure.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"tipsbladet-skiveik\" />\n\nLarge [[renovation]]s and expansions to the stadium began in 1998. At that point, club members referred to the 55 years old ground as the most outdated [[Danish football league system|division]] stadium in Denmark.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As a consequence of the first phase, that involved the [[running track]]s for the [[athlete]]s having synthetic coating installed by 1999 and hence upgrading them to [[International Association of Athletics Federations|international standards]], Skive IK was forced to relocate their [[Professionalism in association football|professional association football]] home matches to Egeris Idr\u00e6tsanl\u00e6g (more specifically ''Bane 1'') in the south part of the city \u2014 the team played a last game at the stadium, before the renovations commenced, against [[Skovshoved IF]] in the fall of 1997 as part of their [[1997\u201398 Danish 2nd Division]] campaign.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The club's professional senior team played at their temporary ground until the reconstruction was completed in 2003, while Skive AM was the only club to use the stadium facilities after the completion of phase one.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"pol-07.11.2002\" /> After a 5.5 year displacement period, Skive IK inaugurated the renovated stadium on 11 May 2003 with a derby against [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] in front of 1,720 spectators as part of a larger celebration program that included [[Public speaking|speeches]], [[cycling]] and athletics competitions.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> The first phase had cost Skive Municipality DKK 10 million, which delayed the second phase of the project due to lack of funds.<ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The task of completing phase two was handed to a local Skive contractor, Kaj Ove Madsen A/S.<ref name=\"sf-28.06.2002\" /> The second phase involved renovations to the buildings by 2003, resulting in a two-story extension of the building's wings totaling 190 m\u00b2, 520 covered seatings and other facilities at the grandstand, a more contemporary [[scoreboard]] and a new grass blanket on the football field was laid.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The existing [[changing room]]s were renovated with additional changing rooms installed for the referees.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Changes also included facilities such as an [[Health club|exercise room]], [[public toilet]]s, a [[cafeteria]] with an extended terrace, a [[kitchen]] at the [[Storey#Numbering|building's ground floor]], while the first floor got VIP rooms for sponsors, press and meetings, a speakerbox, and rooms for the local athletics and cycling clubs, Skive AM and Skive Cykelklub.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Plankings were erected around the stadium as part of the modernisations to the stadium, with the support of Skive IK's then [[chairperson|chairman]], to prevent matches being viewed from Engvej, and the Skive Committee on Culture and Industry took the initiative to beautify the planking with [[vine|climbing plants]].<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" />\n\nThe running tracks were renovated again in 2009 due to wear and tear together with the buildings in 2010, and included the installation of a [[balcony]] at the grandstand and, due to security reasons, a designated area for the away fans at association football matches and better sponsor facilities.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /> On 7 and 10 April 2016, the stadium hosted two [[2016 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship qualification]] games, and have previously staged two men's [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national youth teams]] in 1961 and 2015.<ref name=\"ldb-skive\" /> An upgrade of the existing [[floodlight]]s of 150 [[lux]] to 500 lux was done in the late 2000s to better support the minimum requirements of 1000 lux set forward for evening TV-transmissions at level 2.\n\nNew demands for [[under-soil heating]] at all professional matches in the Danish 1st Division were implemented beginning with the 2017/18 season, and Skive IK could no longer rely on a several years long dispensation from the Danish FA. Hence, in the summer of 2017 [[Skive Municipality]] decided to invest DKK 2.6 million in installing a total of 25 kilometers of pipes under the municipal owned facility's football field as part of the new heating system provided by Danjord.<ref name=\"tvmv-varme\" /><ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> In the years leading up to 2010, both Skive IK Elite A/S and Skive AM had been paying Skive Municipality an [[Economic rent|annual rent]] of DKK 100,000 and in the years leading up to 2019, SIK Elite were paying DKK 318,999 in annual rent for the usage of Skive Stadium, but the latest investments to the ground heating and recent overpayments from Skive IK meant an adjustment of the annual rent down to DKK 295,000 not including the payment for using the new heating system.<ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> The watering system at the stadium, installed in the summer of 2010, makes use of the nearby river, Karup \u00c5, which lowers the cost of water to a minimum.<ref name=\"sf-26.07.2018\" />\n\n== Name, sponsorships and logos ==\nOn 8 September 2009, the Finance Committee of [[Skive Municipality]] approved the sale of the rights to naming [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]] at Skive Stadium to Skive IK Elite A/S for DKK 25,000 for four years in addition to having the rights to sell banner ads at Skive Stadium.<ref name=\"sf-09.09.2009\" /><ref name=\"sf-14.11.2009\" /> On 1 July 2010 the regional [[bank]], Sparbank, obtained the naming rights for the stadium, renaming it Sparbank Arena, creating matching names with the indoor athletics hall next to the stadium, that was constructed in 2007.<ref name=\"sparbank-05.07.2010\" /> When the regional [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]]-based bank merged with the [[Aalborg]]-based bank [[Spar Nord Bank]] in the fall of 2012, the sponsorship agreement was continued in the new financial constellation, with the stadium name being changed to Spar Nord Arena, beginning 18 November 2012.<ref name=\"sf-19.11.2012\" /> The bank announced a withdrawal from its main sponsorship of Skive IK Elite A/S and its naming rights to the stadium in the fall of 2017, which was made public in February 2018, but would continue having the naming rights for the stadium in 2018 until a new sponsor was found.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /><ref name=\"skiveik-26.03.2018\" /> Due to uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal, for a short period in March 2018, the stadium was hence temporarily referred to as SIK Arena.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /> On 1 July 2018, Skive Stadium officially changed its name to Hancock Arena, when a sponsorship deal was reached between the local brewery Hancock Bryggerierne A/S and SIK Elite, that is set to expire on 1 January 2022.<ref name=\"bold.dk-19.04.2018\" /> At [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] matches, it is still known under its original name, Skive Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions.\n\nLogos used for the naming rights agreements of the stadium:\n<gallery widths=\"170px\">\nFile:blank.png | '''Sparbank Arena'''<br />(2010\u20132012)<br />Sponsor: Sparbank\nFile:blank.png | '''Spar Nord Arena'''<br />(2012\u20132018)<br />Sponsor: [[Spar Nord Bank]]\nFile:blank.png | '''Hancock Arena'''<br />(2018\u2013''present'')<br />Sponsor: Hancock Brewery\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\">{{cite web |title=Fakta om Hancock Arena |url=http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |website=www.skive-ik.dk |publisher=[[Skive IK|Skive Idr\u00e6ts Klub]] |accessdate=14 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214131810/http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |archivedate=14 December 2019 |language=da}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sik100\">{{cite book |last1=Preisler |first1=Erik |title=SIK - Skive idr\u00e6tsklub gennem 100 \u00e5r |date=2000 |publisher=Skive Idr\u00e6tsklub |location=Skive |isbn=87-988248-0-5 |pages=42\u201346;

The stadium is part of a sport center, which since 2007 has also consisted of a multi-purpose hall named Spar Nord Arena, while the stadium itself includes [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] certified athletics and sports facilities such as six round lanes, eight straight lanes, starting blocks, electronic timing, two tracks for the [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]], [[pole vault]] and three throw cages surrounding an association football field.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /> The ground has a lighting installation with a light intensity of 500 [[lux]] and have been approved for televised [[Danish 1st Division]] matches by the [[Danish Football Association|Danish FA]].<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /> Apart from hosting matches for the [[Danish 1st Division|second highest football league]], the stadium have also staged two men's youth [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] and two [[2016 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship qualification|European women's youth qualification games]], one for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national youth team]].<ref name=\"ldb-skive\" /> It has been known as '''Hancock Arena''' for [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] reasons since July 2018 and have previously been referred to as '''Sparbank Arena''' (2010\u20132012), '''Spar Nord Arena''' (2012\u20132018) and '''SIK Arena''' (2018).\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the [[List of football stadiums in Denmark|stadium]] at Engvej broke ground in May 1941, with the last details coming into place in the spring of 1943, and the new stadium was finished in 1944 at a total cost of DKK 130,000.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As part of the agreement between [[Skive IK]] and [[Skive Municipality]], a new club house was built at the ground at a cost of DKK 12,000 and the club officially moved to Engvej in the spring of 1944.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> The stadium, with a total area of 9.5 [[barrel of land|barrels of land]] located at the [[meadow]] referred as ''Rosens Eng'' next to Karup River, consisted of an exhibition field with athletics courses, two training fields and four tennis courts.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> In the years leading up to the construction of the stadium, the meadow had already been filled up by the municipality as relief work for the unemployed.<ref name=\"drkis\" /> The inauguration of the stadium at Engvej took place on 5 June 1944 ([[Constitution Day (Denmark)|Constitution Day]]) with a programme consisting of a large athletics event with participation of many of the country's strongest athletes and an [[association football]] match in front of nearly 4,000 [[Audience|spectators]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /> Skive IK, participating in the 1943\u201344 JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke, lost their association football match against the best placed [[Jutland]]ish league team in the [[1943\u201344 Danish War Tournament|1943\u201344 season]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /> Arbejdernes Idr\u00e6tsforening (AIF), which was the competing sports team in the city, had their own inauguration of the stadium on 18 June 1944 with music, singing and association football, and their first team in the JBU's Mellemr\u00e6kke played an exhibition match against the local rivals [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] from the JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke.<ref name=\"sik100\" />\n\nThe City Council of [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]] made a unanimous decision on 12 June 1944 to prohibit the presence of non-paying [[audience|spectators]] at the north lying [[hill]]side, with the residence of the Skive Museum, during association football matches.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> Proposed by the then Street and Road Committee, the ban was meant to discourage potential ''free riders'' from viewing the matches from outside that stadium's gates, which could cost revenue for Skive IK and Skive Municipality.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> However, the local [[police]] have never enforced the ban nor spend resources on it, which have not had any significant impact.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> In the spring of 1945, the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupying forces]] seizes the stadium facilities and on 8 May 1945 a large parade was held by the [[Danish resistance movement]].<ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /> Although the construction of a covered spectator stand had to be abandoned due to the stringent rationing of building material during [[World War II]], it was finally built starting from the summer of 1965 to spring 1966 using voluntary labor and with partial financial support from Skive Municipality for the [[building material]]s, and was attached to Skive IK's new club member's house next to the football field \u2014 the house was inaugurated on 28 March 1966.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /><ref name=\"djfh-m\u00e5\" />\n\nThe stadium holds 10,000 people of which 523 are seated at the covered grandstand in the south west side.<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /> The stadium's record attendance was recorded on 19 May 1955 ([[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]]), when sold-out stadium crowd of nearly 10,000 spectators watched the last decisive league match in the [[1954\u201355 Jutland Series]] between the two highest placed teams in the northern division, Skive IK and local rivals [[Viborg FF]], competing for the division title and hence a spot in the [[Jutland Series|1954\u201355 Jutland Championship]] Final and qualification for the [[1954\u201355 Kvalifikationsturneringen]] (popularly known as the ''Danish 4th Division'').<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The [[Danish football league system|level 4]] league match, that Viborg FF won 3\u20132 in windy rain, is reportedly the largest match attendance to a lower ranking Danish league game, outside of the top three divisional structure.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"tipsbladet-skiveik\" />\n\nLarge [[renovation]]s and expansions to the stadium began in 1998. At that point, club members referred to the 55 years old ground as the most outdated [[Danish football league system|division]] stadium in Denmark.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As a consequence of the first phase, that involved the [[running track]]s for the [[athlete]]s having synthetic coating installed by 1999 and hence upgrading them to [[International Association of Athletics Federations|international standards]], Skive IK was forced to relocate their [[Professionalism in association football|professional association football]] home matches to Egeris Idr\u00e6tsanl\u00e6g (more specifically ''Bane 1'') in the south part of the city \u2014 the team played a last game at the stadium, before the renovations commenced, against [[Skovshoved IF]] in the fall of 1997 as part of their [[1997\u201398 Danish 2nd Division]] campaign.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The club's professional senior team played at their temporary ground until the reconstruction was completed in 2003, while Skive AM was the only club to use the stadium facilities after the completion of phase one.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"pol-07.11.2002\" /> After a 5.5 year displacement period, Skive IK inaugurated the renovated stadium on 11 May 2003 with a derby against [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] in front of 1,720 spectators as part of a larger celebration program that included [[Public speaking|speeches]], [[cycling]] and athletics competitions.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> The first phase had cost Skive Municipality DKK 10 million, which delayed the second phase of the project due to lack of funds.<ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The task of completing phase two was handed to a local Skive contractor, Kaj Ove Madsen A/S.<ref name=\"sf-28.06.2002\" /> The second phase involved renovations to the buildings by 2003, resulting in a two-story extension of the building's wings totaling 190 m\u00b2, 520 covered seatings and other facilities at the grandstand, a more contemporary [[scoreboard]] and a new grass blanket on the football field was laid.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The existing [[changing room]]s were renovated with additional changing rooms installed for the referees.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Changes also included facilities such as an [[Health club|exercise room]], [[public toilet]]s, a [[cafeteria]] with an extended terrace, a [[kitchen]] at the [[Storey#Numbering|building's ground floor]], while the first floor got VIP rooms for sponsors, press and meetings, a speakerbox, and rooms for the local athletics and cycling clubs, Skive AM and Skive Cykelklub.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Plankings were erected around the stadium as part of the modernisations to the stadium, with the support of Skive IK's then [[chairperson|chairman]], to prevent matches being viewed from Engvej, and the Skive Committee on Culture and Industry took the initiative to beautify the planking with [[vine|climbing plants]].<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" />\n\nThe running tracks were renovated again in 2009 due to wear and tear together with the buildings in 2010, and included the installation of a [[balcony]] at the grandstand and, due to security reasons, an designated area for the away fans at association football matches and better sponsor facilities.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /> On 7 and 10 April 2016, the stadium hosted two [[2016 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship qualification]] games, and have previously staged two men's [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national youth teams]] in 1961 and 2015.<ref name=\"ldb-skive\" /> An upgrade of the existing [[floodlight]]s of 150 [[lux]] to 500 lux was done in the late 2000s to better support the minimum requirements of 1000 lux set forward for evening TV-transmissions at level 2.\n\nNew demands for [[under-soil heating]] at all professional matches in the Danish 1st Division were implemented beginning with the 2017/18 season, and Skive IK could no longer rely on a several years long dispensation from the Danish FA. Hence, in the summer of 2017 [[Skive Municipality]] decided to invest DKK 2.6 million in installing a total of 25 kilometers of pipes under the municipal owned facility's football field as part of the new heating system provided by Danjord.<ref name=\"tvmv-varme\" /><ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> In the years leading up to 2010, both Skive IK Elite A/S and Skive AM had been paying Skive Municipality an [[Economic rent|annual rent]] of DKK 100,000 and in the years leading up to 2019, SIK Elite were paying DKK 318,999 in annual rent for the usage of Skive Stadium, but the latest investments to the ground heating and recent overpayments from Skive IK meant an adjustment of the annual rent down to DKK 295,000 not including the payment for using the new heating system.<ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> The watering system at the stadium, installed in the summer of 2010, makes use of the nearby river, Karup \u00c5, which lowers the cost of water to a minimum.<ref name=\"sf-26.07.2018\" />\n\n== Name, sponsorships and logos ==\nOn 8 September 2009, the Finance Committee of [[Skive Municipality]] approved the sale of the rights to naming [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]] at Skive Stadium to Skive IK Elite A/S for DKK 25,000 for four years in addition to having the rights to sell banner ads at Skive Stadium.<ref name=\"sf-09.09.2009\" /><ref name=\"sf-14.11.2009\" /> On 1 July 2010 the regional [[bank]], Sparbank, obtained the naming rights for the stadium, renaming it Sparbank Arena, creating matching names with the indoor athletics hall next to the stadium, that was constructed in 2007.<ref name=\"sparbank-05.07.2010\" /> When the regional [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]]-based bank merged with the [[Aalborg]]-based bank [[Spar Nord Bank]] in the fall of 2012, the sponsorship agreement was continued in the new financial constellation, with the stadium name being changed to Spar Nord Arena, beginning 18 November 2012.<ref name=\"sf-19.11.2012\" /> The bank announced a withdrawal from its main sponsorship of Skive IK Elite A/S and its naming rights to the stadium in the fall of 2017, which was made public in February 2018, but would continue having the naming rights for the stadium in 2018 until a new sponsor was found.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /><ref name=\"skiveik-26.03.2018\" /> Due to uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal, for a short period in March 2018, the stadium was hence temporarily referred to as SIK Arena.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /> On 1 July 2018, Skive Stadium officially changed its name to Hancock Arena, when a sponsorship deal was reached between the local brewery Hancock Bryggerierne A/S and SIK Elite, that is set to expire on 1 January 2022.<ref name=\"bold.dk-19.04.2018\" /> At [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] matches, it is still known under its original name, Skive Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions.\n\nLogos used for the naming rights agreements of the stadium:\n<gallery widths=\"170px\">\nFile:blank.png | '''Sparbank Arena'''<br />(2010\u20132012)<br />Sponsor: Sparbank\nFile:blank.png | '''Spar Nord Arena'''<br />(2012\u20132018)<br />Sponsor: [[Spar Nord Bank]]\nFile:blank.png | '''Hancock Arena'''<br />(2018\u2013''present'')<br />Sponsor: Hancock Brewery\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\">{{cite web |title=Fakta om Hancock Arena |url=http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |website=www.skive-ik.dk |publisher=[[Skive IK|Skive Idr\u00e6ts Klub]] |accessdate=14 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214131810/http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |archivedate=14 December 2019 |language=da}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sik100\">{{cite book |last1=Preisler |first1=Erik |title=SIK - Skive idr\u00e6tsklub gennem 100 \u00e5r |date=2000 |publisher=Skive Idr\u00e6tsklub |location=Skive |isbn=87-988248-0-5 |pages=42-46;

They are often designed in a one-way layout, leading customers counter-clockwise along what IKEA calls \"the long natural way\" designed to encourage the customer to see the store in its entirety (as opposed to a traditional retail store, which allows a customer to go directly to the section where the desired goods and services are displayed). There are often shortcuts to other parts of the showroom.\n\n[[File:IKEA Anderlecht self-serve warehouse (DSCF3734).jpg|thumb|The self-service warehouse area]]\n[[File:IKEA Food market in MegaBox 2017.jpg|thumb|Food market]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wp.nyu.edu/thoughtsonwayfinding/2017/11/19/the-nudge-how-ikeas-store-layout-design-influences-your-spending/|title=The Nudge \u2013 How IKEA\u2019s Store Layout Design Influences Your Spending \u2013 Thoughts on Wayfinding|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> The sequence first involves going through the furniture showrooms making note of selected items. The customer then collects a shopping cart and proceeds to an open-shelf \"Market Hall\" warehouse for smaller items, then visits the [[self-service]] furniture warehouse to collect previously noted showroom products in [[flat pack]] form. Sometimes, they are directed to collect products from an external warehouse on the same site or at a site nearby after purchase. Finally, customers pay for their products at a cash register. Not all furniture is stocked at the store level, such as particular sofa colours needing to be shipped from a warehouse to the customer's home or to the store.\n\nMost stores follow the layout of having the showroom upstairs with the marketplace and self-service warehouse downstairs. Some stores are single level, while others have separate warehouses to allow more stock to be kept on-site. Single-level stores are found predominantly in areas where the cost of land would be less than the cost of building a 2-level store. Some stores have dual-level warehouses with machine-controlled silos to allow large quantities of stock to be accessed throughout the selling day.\n\nMost IKEA stores offer an \"as-is\" area at the end of the warehouse, just before the cash registers. Returned, damaged and formerly showcased products are displayed here and sold with a significant discount, but also with a no-returns policy.\n\nIKEA uses a sales technique called \"bulla bulla\" in which a bunch of items are purposefully jumbled in bins, to create the impression of volume, and therefore, inexpensiveness.<ref name=TNY /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/house-perfect|title=Is the IKEA Aesthetic Comfy or Creepy?|website=The New Yorker|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref><!-- Web search can't confirm this.

Several smaller store formats have been unsuccessfully tested in the past (the \"midi\" concept in the early '90s, which was tested in Ottawa and Heerlen with {{convert|9,300|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, or a \"boutique\" shop in Manhattan). A new format for a full-size, city centre store was introduced with the opening of the [[Manchester]] (United Kingdom) store, situated in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in 2006. Another store, in [[Coventry]] opened in December 2007.  The store has seven floors and a different flow from other IKEA stores. IKEA's [[Southampton]] store which opened in February 2009 is also in the city centre and built in an urban style similar to the Coventry store.  IKEA built these stores in response to UK government restrictions blocking retail establishment outside city centres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html|title=IKEA \u2013 press room \u2013 press release|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], where shop space is limited and costly, IKEA has opened three outlets in the city, most of which have the one-way layout.

This modified store will feature only a display gallery and small warehouse. One location planned for [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] is in the place formerly occupied by a [[Sears|Sears Home]] store. The warehouses will not keep furniture stocked, and so customers will not be able to drop in to purchase and leave with furniture the same day. Instead, they will purchase the furniture in advance online or in store and order the furniture delivered to one of the new stores, for a greatly reduced rate. IKEA claims that this new model will allow them to expand quickly into new markets rather than spending years opening a full-size store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ikea-coming-to-kitchener-1.3332494|title=Ikea coming to Kitchener \u2013 Kitchener-Waterloo \u2013 CBC News|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Products and services==\n===Furniture and homeware===\n[[File:IKEA Billy bookshelf (80x106 cm birch veneer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Billy (bookcase)|Billy]] bookcase]]\n\nRather than being sold pre-assembled, much of IKEA's furniture is designed to be [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|assembled by the customer]]. The company claims that this helps reduce costs and use of packaging by not shipping air; the volume of a bookcase, for example, is considerably less if it is shipped unassembled rather than assembled. This is also more practical for <!-- European --> customers using public transport,  because flat packs can be more easily carried.\n\nIKEA contends that it has been a pioneering force in [[sustainability|sustainable approach]]es to [[Consumerism|mass consumer culture]].<ref>[http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_CA/pdf/sustainability_report/group_approach_sustainability_fy11.pdf The IKEA Group approach to sustainability (2011)]</ref> Kamprad calls this \"democratic design,\" meaning that the company applies an integrated approach to manufacturing and design (see also [[environmental design]]). In response to the [[explosion of human population]] and material expectations in the 20th and 21st centuries, the company implements [[economies of scale]], capturing material streams and creating manufacturing processes that hold costs and resource use down, such as the extensive use of [[Medium-density fibreboard|Medium-Density Fiberboard]] (\"MDF\"), also called \"particle board.\"\n\n[[File:Klippansofa.jpg|thumb|[[Klippan (sofa)|Klippan]] sofa]]\nNotable items of IKEA furniture include the [[Po\u00e4ng]] armchair, the [[Billy (bookcase)|Billy]] bookcase and the [[Klippan (sofa)|Klippan]] sofa, all of which have sold by the tens of millions since the late 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-ikea-products-2016-9/#2-the-poaeng-chair-sells-15-million-units-a-year-11|title=The 12 most popular IKEA products of all time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/t-magazine/design/ikea-forever.html|title=Ikea Forever|last=Fortini|first=Amanda|date=12 September 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 October 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIKEA products are identified by one-word (rarely two-word) names.

The foundation's nonprofit status also means that the Kamprad family cannot reap these profits directly, but the Kamprads do collect a portion of IKEA sales profits through the franchising relationship between INGKA Holding and Inter IKEA Systems.\n\nInter IKEA Systems collected \u20ac631 million of [[franchise fee]]s in 2004, but reported pre-tax profits of only \u20ac225 million in 2004.

For the idea stage, products should be flat-packed so that more items can be shipped at once; products should also be easier to dismantle and recycle. Raw materials are used, and since wood and cotton are two of IKEA's most important manufacturing products, the company works with environmentally friendly forests and cotton, whereby the excessive use of chemicals and water is avoided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/pdf/reports-downloads/sustainability-strategy-people-and-planet-positive.pdf |title=IKEA Group Sustainability Strategy 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIKEA stores recycle waste and many run on renewable energy. All employees are trained in environmental and social responsibility, while public transit is one of the priorities when the location of stores is considered. Also, the coffee and chocolate served at IKEA stores is [[UTZ Certified]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.utz.org/better-business-hub/strengthening-your-reputation/from-store-to-farm-traceability-in-action-at-ikea/ |title=From store to farm \u2013 traceability in action at IKEA \u2013 UTZ.org|website=UTZ.org |language=en-US|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe last stage of the life cycle is the end of life. Most IKEA stores recycle light bulbs and drained batteries, and the company is also exploring the recycling of sofas and other home furnishing products. \n\nAccording to IKEA's 2012 \"Sustainability Report\", 23% of all wood that the company uses meets the standards of the [[Forest Stewardship Council]], and the report states that IKEA aims to double this percentage by 2017.

They are often designed in a one-way layout, leading customers counter-clockwise along what IKEA calls \"the long natural way\" designed to encourage the customer to see the store in its entirety (as opposed to a traditional retail store, which allows a customer to go directly to the section where the desired goods and services are displayed). There are often shortcuts to other parts of the showroom.\n\n[[File:IKEA Anderlecht self-serve warehouse (DSCF3734).jpg|thumb|The self-service warehouse area]]\n[[File:IKEA Food market in MegaBox 2017.jpg|thumb|Food market]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wp.nyu.edu/thoughtsonwayfinding/2017/11/19/the-nudge-how-ikeas-store-layout-design-influences-your-spending/|title=The Nudge \u2013 How IKEA\u2019s Store Layout Design Influences Your Spending \u2013 Thoughts on Wayfinding|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> The sequence first involves going through the furniture showrooms making note of selected items. The customer then collects a shopping cart and proceeds to an open-shelf \"Market Hall\" warehouse for smaller items, then visits the [[self-service]] furniture warehouse to collect previously noted showroom products in [[flat pack]] form. Sometimes, they are directed to collect products from an external warehouse on the same site or at a site nearby after purchase. Finally, customers pay for their products at a cash register. Not all furniture is stocked at the store level, such as particular sofa colours needing to be shipped from a warehouse to the customer's home or to the store.\n\nMost stores follow the layout of having the showroom upstairs with the marketplace and self-service warehouse downstairs. Some stores are single level, while others have separate warehouses to allow more stock to be kept on-site. Single-level stores are found predominantly in areas where the cost of land would be less than the cost of building a 2-level store. Some stores have dual-level warehouses with machine-controlled silos to allow large quantities of stock to be accessed throughout the selling day.\n\nMost IKEA stores offer an \"as-is\" area at the end of the warehouse, just before the cash registers. Returned, damaged and formerly showcased products are displayed here and sold with a significant discount, but also with a no-returns policy.\n\nIKEA uses a sales technique called \"bulla bulla\" in which a bunch of items are purposefully jumbled in bins, to create the impression of volume, and therefore, inexpensiveness.<ref name=TNY /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/house-perfect|title=Is the IKEA Aesthetic Comfy or Creepy?|website=The New Yorker|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref><!-- Web search can't confirm this.

Several smaller store formats have been unsuccessfully tested in the past (the \"midi\" concept in the early '90s, which was tested in Ottawa and Heerlen with {{convert|9,300|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, or a \"boutique\" shop in Manhattan). A new format for a full-size, city centre store was introduced with the opening of the [[Manchester]] (United Kingdom) store, situated in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in 2006. Another store, in [[Coventry]] opened in December 2007.  The store has seven floors and a different flow from other IKEA stores. IKEA's [[Southampton]] store which opened in February 2009 is also in the city centre and built in an urban style similar to the Coventry store.  IKEA built these stores in response to UK government restrictions blocking retail establishment outside city centres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html|title=IKEA \u2013 press room \u2013 press release|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], where shop space is limited and costly, IKEA has opened three outlets in the city, most of which have the one-way layout.

This modified store will feature only a display gallery and small warehouse. One location planned for [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] is in the place formerly occupied by a [[Sears|Sears Home]] store. The warehouses will not keep furniture stocked, and so customers will not be able to drop in to purchase and leave with furniture the same day. Instead, they will purchase the furniture in advance online or in store and order the furniture delivered to one of the new stores, for a greatly reduced rate. IKEA claims that this new model will allow them to expand quickly into new markets rather than spending years opening a full-size store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ikea-coming-to-kitchener-1.3332494|title=Ikea coming to Kitchener \u2013 Kitchener-Waterloo \u2013 CBC News|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Products and services==\n===Furniture and homeware===\n[[File:IKEA Billy bookshelf (80x106 cm birch veneer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Billy (bookcase)|Billy]] bookcase]]\n\nRather than being sold pre-assembled, much of IKEA's furniture is designed to be [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|assembled by the customer]]. The company claims that this helps reduce costs and use of packaging by not shipping air; the volume of a bookcase, for example, is considerably less if it is shipped unassembled rather than assembled. This is also more practical for <!-- European --> customers using public transport,  because flat packs can be more easily carried.\n\nIKEA contends that it has been a pioneering force in [[sustainability|sustainable approach]]es to [[Consumerism|mass consumer culture]].<ref>[http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_CA/pdf/sustainability_report/group_approach_sustainability_fy11.pdf The IKEA Group approach to sustainability (2011)]</ref> Kamprad calls this \"democratic design,\" meaning that the company applies an integrated approach to manufacturing and design (see also [[environmental design]]). In response to the [[explosion of human population]] and material expectations in the 20th and 21st centuries, the company implements [[economies of scale]], capturing material streams and creating manufacturing processes that hold costs and resource use down, such as the extensive use of [[Medium-density fibreboard|Medium-Density Fiberboard]] (\"MDF\"), also called \"particle board.\"\n\n[[File:Klippansofa.jpg|thumb|[[Klippan (sofa)|Klippan]] sofa]]\nNotable items of IKEA furniture include the [[Po\u00e4ng]] armchair, the [[Billy (bookcase)|Billy]] bookcase and the [[Klippan (sofa)|Klippan]] sofa, all of which have sold by the tens of millions since the late 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-ikea-products-2016-9/#2-the-poaeng-chair-sells-15-million-units-a-year-11|title=The 12 most popular IKEA products of all time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/t-magazine/design/ikea-forever.html|title=Ikea Forever|last=Fortini|first=Amanda|date=12 September 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 October 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIKEA products are identified by one-word (rarely two-word) names.

Because INGKA Holding is owned by the nonprofit INGKA Foundation, none of this profit is taxed. The foundation's nonprofit status also means that the Kamprad family cannot reap these profits directly, but the Kamprads do collect a portion of IKEA sales profits through the franchising relationship between INGKA Holding and Inter IKEA Systems.\n\nInter IKEA Systems collected \u20ac631 million of [[franchise fee]]s in 2004, but reported pre-tax profits of only \u20ac225 million in 2004. One of the major pre-tax expenses that Inter IKEA systems reported was \u20ac590 million of \"other operating charges\". IKEA has refused to explain these charges, but Inter IKEA Systems appears to make large payments to I.I. Holding, another Luxembourg-registered group that, according to ''[[The Economist]],'' \"is almost certain to be controlled by the Kamprad family.\" I.I. Holding made a profit of \u20ac328 million in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the Inter IKEA group of companies and I.I.

IKEA was one of a number of companies, including West German firms, which benefited from this practice. The investigation resulted from attempts by former political prisoners to obtain compensation. In November 2012, IKEA admitted being aware at the time of the possibility of use of [[unfree labour|forced labor]] and failing to exercise sufficient control to identify and avoid it.

Viewers will be directed to a new [[Facebook]] page for the brand, where they are able to vote on who they believe is messier, and submit evidence using videos and photos through an app created especially for the campaign.

Nana is not an actual first name, but a Ghanaian title of nobility. His 1996 ''[[Nana (album)|self-titled debut album]]'' was certified Platinum in Poland and Gold in Germany and Switzerland. The album spawned the 1997 hit single, \"[[Lonely (Nana song)|Lonely]]\", which reached number-one in Germany and Switzerland, and was certified Platinum in Germany.\n\n==Early life==\nNana arrived in [[Hamburg]], Germany, with his mother and his brothers at the age of 10.<ref name=\"discogs\">{{Cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/214104|title=Nana (2)|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\n===Beginnings===\nAt the beginning of the 90s, his debut consisted of DJing in hip-hop clubs. He also co-produced and rapped in some songs of DJ David Fascher (\"Here We Go\", \"Make The Crowd Go Wild\"), under the alias '''MC Africa True'''.\n\n===1995: Eurodance project and departure===\nIn 1995 he joined the Eurodance project Darkness as a rapper, which was produced by B\u00fclent Aris and [[Toni Cottura]]. The song \"Dreams\" became a club hit, but Nana didn't feel very comfortable with the style Darkness adopted and the group separated. However, his current scene name, Darkman, originated from this time.\n\n===1996-1997: Debut album and commercial success===\nIn 1996 Aris and Cottura founded the [[Black Music]] label Booya Music, which Nana joined as the first artist. The first single, \"Darkman\" reached the top 10 of [[Germany]]'s official single-chart  by [[Media Control Charts|Media Control]]. The following single, \"Lonely\", became the most successful euro-rap song, being number-one for several weeks. The album, ''Nana'', released in 1997, is more on the mainstream, American style of rapping.<ref name=\"discogs\"/> It features numerous other members of the Booya Family, such as Jan van der Toorn and [[Alex Prince]].\n\n===1998: ''Father''===\nThe second album, ''Father'', was released in May 1998 and contains slower pieces and more personal lyrics.<ref name=\"discogs\"/> The songs \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" and \"War\" were also featured on the tribute albums ''Love The Bee Gees'' and ''Hands on Motown''.\n\n===1999-2004: Single releases and hiatus===\nAt the end of 1999, Nana's released the single \"I Wanna Fly\", which flopped, due to a decrease in euro-rap's popularity and the growing importance of hip-hop played in [[German language|German]]. Nevertheless, Nana still recorded two further albums with Booya Music, which were not released due to legal problems.\n\nAt the beginning of 2001 Nana released the German-language song ''Du wirst sehen'', a gesture which was not appreciated by international fans.

Nana is not an actual first name, but a Ghanaian title of nobility. His 1996 ''[[Nana (album)|self-titled debut album]]'' was certified Platinum in Poland and Gold in Germany and Switzerland. The album spawned the 1997 hit single, \"[[Lonely (Nana song)|Lonely]]\", which reached number-one in Germany and Switzerland, and was certified Platinum in Germany.\n\n==Early life==\nNana arrived in [[Hamburg]], Germany, with his mother and his brothers at the age of 10.<ref name=\"discogs\">{{Cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/214104|title=Nana (2)|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\n===Beginnings===\nAt the beginning of the 90s, his debut consisted of DJ-ing in hip-hop clubs. He also co-produced and rapped in some songs of DJ David Fascher (\"Here We Go\", \"Make The Crowd Go Wild\"), under the alias '''MC Africa True'''.\n\n===1995: Eurodance project and departure===\nIn 1995 he joined the Eurodance project Darkness as a rapper, which was produced by B\u00fclent Aris and [[Toni Cottura]]. The song \"Dreams\" became a club hit, but Nana didn't feel very comfortable with the style Darkness adopted and the group separated. However, his current scene name, Darkman, originated from this time.\n\n===1996-1997: Debut album and commercial success===\nIn 1996 Aris and Cottura founded the [[Black Music]] label Booya Music, which Nana joined as the first artist. The first single, \"Darkman\" reached the top 10 of [[Germany]]'s official single-chart  by [[Media Control Charts|Media Control]]. The following single, \"Lonely\", became the most successful euro-rap song, being number-one for several weeks. The album, ''Nana'', released in 1997, is more on the mainstream, American style of rapping.<ref name=\"discogs\"/> It features numerous other members of the Booya Family, such as Jan van der Toorn and [[Alex Prince]].\n\n===1998: ''Father''===\nThe second album, ''Father'', was released in May 1998 and contains slower pieces and more personal lyrics.<ref name=\"discogs\"/> The songs \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" and \"War\" were also featured on the tribute albums ''Love The Bee Gees'' and ''Hands on Motown''.\n\n===1999-2004: Single releases and hiatus===\nAt the end of 1999, Nana's released the single \"I Wanna Fly\", which flopped, due to a decrease in euro-rap's popularity and the growing importance of hip-hop played in [[German language|German]]. Nevertheless, Nana still recorded two further albums with Booya Music, which were not released due to legal problems.\n\nAt the beginning of 2001 Nana released the German-language song ''Du wirst sehen'', a gesture which was not appreciated by international fans. The single flopped, and the planned bilingual album ''Global Playa'' was canceled at the request of the record company.\n\n===2004: ''All Doors in Flight No. 7''===\nAfter a long break, in the summer of 2004, Nana finally released the album ''All Doors In Flight No. 7'', featuring Jan van der Toorn and Manuell, on his own label, '''Darkman Records'''.<ref name=\"discogs\"/> The album was distributed exclusively over the Internet, through Nana's website.\n\n== Discography ==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The University was founded by [[royal charter]] issued by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852, with roots in the founding of the [[S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec]] in 1663 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Laval|Fran\u00e7ois de Montmorency-Laval]], making it the oldest centre of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French.

After the [[Conquest of 1760]], the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and [[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested expanding the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec into Universit\u00e9 Laval. [[Louis-Jacques Casault|Louis Casault]], a priest who taught physics at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.\n\nThe S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], at the request of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] (Governor-General of the Province of Canada), creating Universit\u00e9 Laval with \"the rights and privileges of a university\".<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/Universit\u00e9 Laval<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816195903/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001990 |date=2007-08-16 }}</ref> The charter was signed in 1852.

In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the Universit\u00e9 Laval council.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux S\u00e9minaire'') in 1989.\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Laval is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.<ref name=langton1906>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/universitytoron02macagoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/universitytoron02macagoog/page/n394 306]|title=The University of Toronto and its colleges, 1827-1906|last=Langton|first=Hugh Hornby|last2=Macallum|first2=Archibald Byron|publisher=The University Library, pub. by the librarian|year=1906}}</ref>{{rp|306}}\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science.<ref name=langton1906 />{{rp|1904}} In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n\"Laval\", a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer, [[Wilfrid Beaudry]], was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal.

[[Canada]]. The University was founded by [[royal charter]] issued by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852, with roots in the founding of the [[S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec]] in 1663 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Laval|Fran\u00e7ois de Montmorency-Laval]], making it the oldest centre of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French. The university, whose campus was erected from the 1950s onward in the suburban borough of [[Sainte-Foy\u2013Sillery\u2013Cap-Rouge]], is ranked among the top 10 Canadian universities in terms of research funding<ref>Universit\u00e9 Laval.

After the [[Conquest of 1760]], the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and [[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested expanding the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec into Universit\u00e9 Laval. [[Louis-Jacques Casault|Louis Casault]], a priest who taught physics at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.\n\nThe S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], at the request of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] (Governor-General of the Province of Canada), creating Universit\u00e9 Laval with \"the rights and privileges of a university\".<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/Universit\u00e9 Laval<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816195903/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001990 |date=2007-08-16 }}</ref> The charter was signed in 1852.

In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the Universit\u00e9 Laval council.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux S\u00e9minaire'') in 1989.\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Laval is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.<ref name=langton1906>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/universitytoron02macagoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/universitytoron02macagoog/page/n394 306]|title=The University of Toronto and its colleges, 1827-1906|last=Langton|first=Hugh Hornby|last2=Macallum|first2=Archibald Byron|publisher=The University Library, pub. by the librarian|year=1906}}</ref>{{rp|306}}\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science.<ref name=langton1906 />{{rp|1904}} In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n\"Laval\", a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer, [[Wilfrid Beaudry]], was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal.

The piles, however, still seem in place. A capital has rotated, perhaps dragged by the deck that passed over it, but the bulk of the pile, the one in the riverbed is intact. The piles are very deep, I doubt that the explanations for this collapse lie in the fact that you are in the river bed.

This was before the discovery of a crack in the asphalt of the road in November 2019.<ref name=\u201dEuronews_2\u201d>[https://www.news1.news/a/2020/04/ponte-collapsed-who-is-the-anas-manager-who-signed-the-letter-of-tutto-a-posto.html Ponte collapsed, who is the Anas manager who signed the letter of \u201cTutto a posto\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Root causes of the disaster==\n\nAlthough the root causes of the collapse of the bridge like a house of cards are not yet identified, some conjectures have already been put forwards by some experts. Indeed, ''Voce Apuana'' reports that the engineer Fabrizio Ferrari, nephew of Nino Ferrari who constructed the bridge together with Professor Muggia between 1906 and 1908, told his speculations to CDS: {{Quote|text=\"His impression is that there has been a break due to a cut of a section of the deck at a support. The piles, however, still seem in place. A capital has rotated, perhaps dragged by the deck that passed over it, but the bulk of the pile, the one in the riverbed is intact. The piles are very deep, I doubt that the explanations for this collapse lie in the fact that you are in the river bed. Whether it is a failure of the deck.\"<ref name=\"Voceapuana_1\" />}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ponte Morandi#Collapse|Ponte Morandi]]\u2014A road viaduct in [[Genoa]] that collapsed in 2018\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.voceapuana.com/fotogallery/crollato-il-ponte-sul-magra-disastro-ad-776_1.aspx La Voce Apuana: Collapse of the Caprigliola bridge]\n* [https://www.controradio.it/albiano-magra-anas-scrisse-fatta-ispezione-niente-anomalie/ Controradio: Albiano Magra, Anas wrote 'inspection done, no anomalies']\n* [https://www.ilfogliettone.it/crolla-ponte-sul-magra-tra-liguria-e-toscana-2-mezzi-coinvolti/ Ilfogliettone.it: Bridge collapses over the Magra river between Liguria and Tuscany, 2 vehicles involved]\n* Video: [https://tg24.sky.it/cronaca/2020/04/08/ponte-crollato-albiano-sindaco-aulla.html Bridge collapse near Aulla]\n\n[[Category:2020 in Italy]]\n[[Category:2020 road incidents]]\n[[Category:21st century in Tuscany]]\n[[Category:April 2020 events in Europe]]\n[[Category:Bridge disasters in Italy]]\n[[Category:Bridge disasters of unknown cause]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2020]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Italy]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in Italy]]\n[[Category:Viaducts]]\n\n{{Italy-bridge-struct-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Verbcatcher", "label": "safe", "comment": "standard quote marks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprigliola_bridge_collapse"}
