The city's significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region's important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops, and the state was occupied by Union troops for the duration of the war. Then African-Americans from Middle Tennessee fled to contraband camps around military installations in Nashville's eastern, western, and southern borders. The [[Battle of Nashville]] (December 15\u201316, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a [[war of attrition]], making [[guerrilla]] raids and engaging in small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in the [[Deep South]] almost constantly in retreat.\n\nIn 1868, a few years after the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was founded by Confederate veteran [[John W.

This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African-American attorneys [[Z. Alexander Looby]] and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.<ref>Spinney 1998, p. 96</ref>\n\nWith the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed\", the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-white East High School to him. A similar case was filed by [[Reverend]] Henry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the \"Nashville Plan\", where the city's public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.<ref name=BitterSoutherner />\n\nUrban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.<ref name=BitterSoutherner />\n\n===Postwar development to present===\nRapid [[suburb]]anization occurred during the years immediately after World War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County Judge [[Beverly Briley]] and Mayor [[Ben West]].<ref name=\"bucy\"/>\n\nFollowing the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided.<ref name=\"bucy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Government/docs/MetroHistoryBucy.pdf |title=A Short History of the Creation of Metropolitan Government for Nashville-Davidson County |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |first=Carole |last=Bucy |date=2015}}</ref> This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms. Hotels and restaurants were also segregated. Between February 13 and May 10, 1960, [[Nashville sit-ins|a series of sit-ins]] were organized at lunch counters in downtown Nashville by the [[Nashville Student Movement]] and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, and were part of a broader [[sit-in movement]] in the southeastern United States as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities.<ref>Houston 2012, p. 91-99</ref> On April 19, 1960, the house of Z.

The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are elected [[at-large]] and 35 are elected from [[single-member district]]s, each to serve a term of four years.<ref name=\"bucy\"/> In 1957 Nashville desegregated it's school system using an innovative grade a year plan, in response to a class action suit Kelly vs. Board of Education of Nashville.

Craig's orchestra was also the first to broadcast over local radio station WSM-AM and enjoyed phenomenal success with a 12-year show on the [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Network. In the late 1930s, he introduced a newcomer, [[Dinah Shore]], a local graduate of Hume Fogg High School and Vanderbilt University.\n\nRadio station [[WMOT|WMOT-FM]] in nearby [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], which formerly programmed jazz almost exclusively and still does so on the weekends, aided significantly in the recent revival of the city's jazz scene, as has the non-profit Nashville Jazz Workshop, which holds concerts and classes in a renovated building in the north Nashville neighborhood of Germantown.

Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing by a candidate from Wallace's [[American Independent Party]] kept the seat in Democratic hands. However, they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably [[Joseph W. Byrns Sr.|Jo Byrns]], who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] for much of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s first term as President. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was [[Percy Priest]], who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors [[Richard Fulton]] and [[Bill Boner]] also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th District]], represented by Republican [[Marsha Blackburn]].

All three of these interstate highways, which also serve the suburbs, form brief [[concurrency (road)|concurrencies]] with each other in the city, and completely encircle downtown. [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|Interstate 440]] is a bypass route connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of downtown Nashville.

Ellington Parkway, a freeway made up of a section of [[U.S. Route 31E in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31E]], runs between east of downtown and Briley Parkway, serving as an alternative route to I-65. [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]] provides an outer southern bypass for the city, and a bypass for I-40 for the city and its suburbs.

The city's significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region's important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops, and the state was occupied by Union troops for the duration of the war. Then African-Americans from Middle Tennessee fled to contraband camps around military installations in Nashville's eastern, western, and southern borders. The [[Battle of Nashville]] (December 15\u201316, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a [[war of attrition]], making [[guerrilla]] raids and engaging in small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in the [[Deep South]] almost constantly in retreat.\n\nIn 1868, a few years after the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was founded by Confederate veteran [[John W.

This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African-American attorneys [[Z. Alexander Looby]] and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.<ref>Spinney 1998, p. 96</ref>\n\nWith the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed\", the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-white East High School to him. A similar case was filed by [[Reverend]] Henry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the \"Nashville Plan\", where the city's public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.<ref name=BitterSoutherner />\n\nUrban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.<ref name=BitterSoutherner />\n\n===Postwar development to present===\nRapid [[suburb]]anization occurred during the years immediately after World War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County Judge [[Beverly Briley]] and Mayor [[Ben West]].<ref name=\"bucy\"/>\n\nFollowing the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided.<ref name=\"bucy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Government/docs/MetroHistoryBucy.pdf |title=A Short History of the Creation of Metropolitan Government for Nashville-Davidson County |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |first=Carole |last=Bucy |date=2015}}</ref> This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms.

With a long history in the music scene it is no surprise that city was nicknamed 'Music City.' The [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]] is the major performing arts center of the city. It is the home of the [[Nashville Repertory Theatre]], the [[Nashville Opera Association|Nashville Opera]], the [[Music City Drum and Bugle Corps]], and the Nashville Ballet. In September 2006, the [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] opened as the home of the [[Nashville Symphony]].\n\nAs the city's name itself is a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the country music industry, many popular tourist attractions involve [[country music]], including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[Belcourt Theatre]], and [[Ryman Auditorium]]. The Ryman was home to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' until 1974 when the show moved to the Grand Ole Opry House, {{convert|9|mi}} east of downtown. The Opry plays there several times a week, except for an annual winter run at the Ryman.\n[[File:RCAStudioB Console.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]]\u2019s audio console at [[RCA Studio B]] in Nashville.

The [[Tennessee State Fair]] is also held annually in September.\n[[File:Broadway in Nashville, TN.jpg|alt=Photo of Broadway near the Cumberland River taken during Coronoavirus lockdown April 2020.|thumb|Broadway near the Cumberland River, April 2020]]\nNashville was once home of television shows such as ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[Pop! Goes the Country]]'', as well as [[The Nashville Network]] and later, [[RFD-TV]]. [[Country Music Television]] and [[Great American Country]] currently operate from Nashville. The city was also home to the [[Opryland USA|Opryland USA theme park]], which operated from 1972 to 1997 before being closed by its owners ([[Gaylord Entertainment Company]]) and soon after demolished to make room for the [[Opry Mills]] mega-shopping mall.\n\nThe [[Contemporary Christian music]] industry is based along Nashville's [[Music Row]], with a great influence in neighboring [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]]. The Christian record companies include [[EMI Christian Music Group]], [[Provident Label Group]] and [[Word Records]].\n\nMusic Row houses many [[gospel music]] and Contemporary Christian music companies centered around 16th and 17th Avenues South. On River Road, off Charlotte Pike in West Nashville, the ''CabaRay'' opened its doors on January 18, 2018. The performing venue of [[Ray Stevens]] it offers a [[Vegas]]-style dinner and a show atmosphere. There is also a [[piano bar]] and a [[gift shop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://raystevenscabaray.com/ |title=Ray Stevens CabaRay Showroom}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Nashville was never known as a major [[jazz]] town, it did have many great jazz bands, including The Nashville Jazz Machine led by Dave Converse and its current version, the Nashville Jazz Orchestra, led by Jim Williamson, as well as The Establishment, led by Billy Adair. The Francis Craig Orchestra entertained Nashvillians from 1929 to 1945 from the Oak Bar and Grille Room in the [[Hermitage Hotel]]. Craig's orchestra was also the first to broadcast over local radio station WSM-AM and enjoyed phenomenal success with a 12-year show on the [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Network. In the late 1930s, he introduced a newcomer, [[Dinah Shore]], a local graduate of Hume Fogg High School and Vanderbilt University.\n\nRadio station [[WMOT|WMOT-FM]] in nearby [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], which formerly programmed jazz almost exclusively and still does so on the weekends, aided significantly in the recent revival of the city's jazz scene, as has the non-profit Nashville Jazz Workshop, which holds concerts and classes in a renovated building in the north Nashville neighborhood of Germantown. [[Fisk University]] also maintains a jazz station, [[WFSK]].\n\nNashville has an active theatre scene and is home to several professional and community theatre companies. [[Nashville Children's Theatre]], Nashville Repertory Theatre, the [[Nashville Shakespeare Festival]], the Dance Theatre of Tennessee and the Tennessee Women's Theater Project are among the most prominent professional companies. One community theatre, Circle Players, has been in operation for over 60 years.\n\nThe [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] has its headquarters in Nashville.\n\n===Tourism===\nPerhaps the biggest factor in drawing visitors to Nashville is its association with country music, in which the [[Nashville sound]] played a role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/nashville-become-hub-country-music.htm |title=How Did Nashville Become the Hub of Country Music? |work=How Stuff Works |first=Dave |last=Roos |date=June 25, 2018 |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref> Many visitors to Nashville attend live performances of the Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest-running live radio show. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is another major attraction relating to the popularity of country music. The [[Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center]], the Opry Mills regional shopping mall and the ''[[General Jackson (riverboat)|General Jackson]]'' showboat, are all located in what is known as Music Valley.\n\nCivil War history is important to the city's tourism industry. Sites pertaining to the [[Battle of Nashville]] and the nearby [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]] and [[Battle of Stones River]] can be seen, along with several well-preserved antebellum plantation houses such as [[Belle Meade Plantation]], Carnton plantation in Franklin, and Belmont Mansion.<ref name=\"Davidson2005\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/6/2005_6_31.shtml |title=Singing City |journal=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |first=Carla |last=Davidson |volume=56 |issue=6 |date=November\u2013December 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012041857/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/6/2005_6_31.shtml |archivedate=October 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nNashville has many arts centers and museums, including the [[Frist Center for the Visual Arts]], [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art]], the [[Tennessee State Museum]], the [[Johnny Cash Museum]], Fisk University's Van Vechten and Aaron Douglas Galleries, Vanderbilt University's Fine Art Gallery and Sarratt Gallery, the [[National Museum of African American Music]], and the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|full-scale replica]] of the [[Parthenon]].\n\nNashville has become an increasingly popular destination for [[bachelor party|bachelor]] and [[bachelorette party|bachelorette parties]].<ref name=\"buzzfeed20180329\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/how-nashville-became-one-big-bachelorette-party |title=How Nashville Became One Big Bachelorette Party |work=[[BuzzFeed]] |last=Petersen |first=Anne Helen |date=March 29, 2018 |access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> In 2017 ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' counted 33 bachelorette parties on Lower Broadway (\"from Fifth Avenue down to the Cumberland River, it's their town\") in less than two hours on a Friday night, and stated that the actual number was likely higher.

The main premise of the series is that the beyblade is customizable, with interchangeable parts.\n\nBoth the toys and their names were inspired by \"'''Beigoma'''\", a traditional spinning top.  The concept is similar to [[Battling Tops]], a board game developed by [[Ideal Toy Company]] in 1968. The toy line was introduced with an accompanying [[Beyblade (manga)|manga series of the same name]] in 1999. In 2002, [[Hasbro]] began to sell Beyblade toys internationally (under license from, and produced by, Takara) along with a coordinated country-by-country release of localized versions of the TV series. In August 2008, Takara Tomy released ''Beyblade: Metal Fusion''; the first incarnation of the toy in three and a half years.\n\nThe ''[[Beyblade Burst]]'' series debuted in 2015, followed by ''Beyblade Burst Evolution'', ''Beyblade Burst Turbo'', and most recently ''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (known to Takara Tomy as Beyblade Burst GT).\n\n==Game and rules==\nAside from informal play, a game with specific rules is published. The formal game is played with two players or more. Each player is allowed up to three Beyblades to choose from during a match. Players may use any parts available to them to make their Beyblades as long as they are not restricted (such as in tournament play), but may not switch parts once a match has started. Players may choose from any of the three Beyblades they have with them for any battle in a match. In Beyblade and The Metal saga series, the first player to 1 point wins. In Beyblade Burst, Beyblade Burst Evolution, Beyblade Burst Turbo, and Beyblade Burst Gachi, it is up to 2 or 3 points depending on the type of match. A normal match or a match that isn't the finals will most likely be up to 2 points. Final matches are up to 3 points. (In Beyblade Burst Evolution, in the God Bladers Cup (Japan) or International Bladers Cup (English dub), the semi-final was up to three points.)  A survivor finish is where one top has stopped spinning and the other top continues to spin. That is 1 point. A ring out finish is where a top falls into a hole called a pocket or flies out of the Beystadium. That is 1 point. A burst finish (Beyblade Burst series only) is where a beyblade top breaks into three pieces. That is two points. When a beyblade burst into 4 or more pieces that is 3 points(Takara Tomy does not support this). A Battle Royale is where three or more players play. The last top spinning wins.<ref>https://www.fun.be/media/Beyblade%20Burst%20Guide%20Book.pdf</ref>\n\nPoints are awarded to the player based on how their Beyblade knocks out their opponent's Beyblade: (names are different depending on where you come from, Japanese saying comes after English dub saying.)\n* One point is awarded if the opponent's Beyblade stops spinning (Survivor/Spin Finish).\n* One point is awarded if the opponent's Beyblade is knocked out of the stadium or into a trap on the edge of the ring (Ring Out/Over Finish).\n* Beginning with ''Beyblade Burst'', two points are awarded if the opponent's Beyblade bursts (hence the name) during a battle (Burst Finish).\n\nIn the event of a draw (both Beyblades are knocked out of the ring, stop spinning simultaneously, or burst at the same time), no points are awarded to either player.\n\n==Types of Beyblade toys==\n\nThe three main types of Beyblades have rock-paper-scissors style effectiveness, with Attack generally being weak to Defense, Defense to Stamina, and Stamina to Attack. However, due to the high variability of the custom designs, this is not a hard rule. Balance types may be strong or weak to any of the others depending on specific parts.\n\nAttack/Striker: These Beyblades specialize in attacking other Beyblades. They battle fiercely and try to knock out the other Beyblade as fast as they can. They tend to outperform Stamina-Type Beyblades due to their lack of defense.\n\nDefense/Defender: These Beyblades specialize in knocking back attacks. They tend to travel slowly and are heavier than other types, resulting in opponents being deflected. Their weight also causes them to launch slower, resulting in less stamina. They tend to wear down Attack-types but are outlasted by Stamina.\n\nStamina/Endurance: These Beyblades specialize in stamina. They are used so they can out-spin the enemy Bey and win. In exchange for a lack of power, their stamina lasts longer against other Type of Beyblades making them naturally advantageous over Defense-Types, which focus on resisting hits.\n\nBalance/Combination: These Beyblades specialize in a mix of the other three types listed above, giving them no glaring strengths or weaknesses. They use a mix of Attack, Defense, and Stamina Types put together to make an even mix to win.\n\n==Stadium==\n\nA special arena called a Beystadium is also sold. It is primarily a shallow plastic tub but may have other features dependent on the purpose of the particular stadium.\n\nDifferent stadiums were released in different markets. Takara Tomy and Sonokong produce Beystadiums similar to those featured in the manga, with open sections in the walls and openings on the sides to launch into. Hasbro produces stadiums with high walls and pockets that count as a ring-out instead.\n \nCommon features of a Beystadium include a shallow impression called a cyclone ridge, which allows Attack type Beyblades to move around quickly without accidentally knocking themselves out, and cyclone points, which are recessed disks in the stadium floor that spin freely to add randomness to a battle. Other features may be specific to the series that the Beystadium is released in, like outer Rail sections in the ''Beyblade Burst: Turbo'' being meant for SlingShock Beyblades (ex:Forneus F4) to move around the outside of the stadium before returning in a straight line toward a certain point if slingshock mode is activated, in Beyblade Burst Rise, the HyperSphere Stadium, meant for HyperSphere Beyblades (ex:Air knight K5) where the performance tip are very round to ride the rails and strike the enemy Beyblade. The HyperSphere and slingshock stadiums are both made by Hasbro. Both of the stadiums said are inspired from the Beyblade Burst anime.\nA Beyblade Launcher is use to launch the beyblade in the battle. There\u2019s more powerful launchers that work better. (ex:Xcalius sword launcher).\nTT (Takara Tomy) do not sell HyperSphere or slingshock.\n\n==System==\nThe \"Basic System\" tops are the first generation of [[Beyblade]] tops. They are made entirely of [[plastic]], with the exception of Weight Disks and some tips. These Beyblades consist of four basic parts:\n\n*'''Bit Chip''': A decorative plate inserted into the Attack Ring of the Beyblade, adorned with a small icon of a mythical creature. In the manga, these creatures' souls were housed in the Beyblades themselves. Later Beyblades included a clear Bit Protector that prevented damage to the Bit Chip.\n* ''' Attack Ring ''': The Attack Ring determines the blade's effect when it impacts against its opponent, as this is normally the first part to come into contact with the opposing blade. Also, the Attack Ring holds the Bit Chip in place on the top, preventing it from coming off mid-battle.\n* ''' Weight Disk ''': A metal disk that adds weight to the bey and determines its weight distribution and much of its total weight.\n* ''' Blade Base ''': The Blade Base determines how the Beyblade spins and also affects its movement pattern. A Spin Gear on later releases determines the direction of the Beyblade's rotation; either clockwise (right) or counterclockwise (left) dependent on which Spin Gear/Spin Gear Casings is/are used. The BB is attached to the AR.\n\n===Magnacore System (MG)===\nIntroduced with the V-series, the \"Magnacore\" line of Beyblade toys featured magnetic Spin Gears and Weight Disks to attract or repel blades from each other. Additionally, certain Beystadiums had points to attach magnets, which affected the movement pattern.\n\n===Engine Gear System (EG)===\n'''Engine Gear''' tops were introduced with the G-series, and retain the same major design of a typical Beyblade, including a Bit Piece, an Attack Ring, a Weight Disk, and a Blade Base; Engine Gear tops, however, replace the typical Spin Gear with a more advanced Engine Gear, which affects the movement of the top during the battle. Each Engine Gear includes a '''Turbo Winder''' to wind-up the engine core. When in action, the Blade Base releases the Engine Gear determined by the Blade Base's clutch lock system. This series of Beyblades were the last ones to be made of plastic parts with the exception of the weight disks. The later ones were semi-metal or completely metal.\n\n====Engine gear types====\n* '''Engine Gear''': The default engine gear that comes with most Beyblades in G-revolution, but their tip is varied.\n* '''Turbo Engine Gear''': First released with the left-spinning Dragoon GT, the Turbo Engine Gear gives an even more powerful release than that of the original engine gear that comes with a larger turbo winder.\n* '''Reverse Gear''': The Engine Gear spins in the opposite direction of the rest of the top. This engine gear is only bundled with Dranzer gt, which uses this gear for a reverse zig-zag attack. Although this attack can be very effective, the Beyblade loses spin when the gear kicks in. As with Dragoon GT, it comes with a larger turbo winder.\n* '''Gyro Engine Gear''': This unique type allows the tip of the Beyblade to spin independently. Thus the Beyblade can be launched without a launcher, as a ripcord can be inserted into the Beyblade.\n\n====Blade base types====\n* '''Instant Release''' or '''First Clutch''': The Engine Gear triggers at the beginning of the battle, resulting in a type a large burst of speed almost immediately after launch.\n* '''Steady Release''': The Engine Gear triggers at the beginning of the battle, but releases earlier because of the weight of Kwa'Hit Release''' or '''Final Clutch''': The Engine Gear triggers when the blade base collides with an object, or when the Beyblade is running out of spin, and releases a quick burst of speed. The clutches must be pulled before winding the spin gear.\n* '''Middle Clutch''': Built exclusively for Dranzer GT, the middle clutch has a similar design to the Final Clutch Base, but releases the engine gear in the middle of the match; earlier than a final clutch but not instant as in the First Clutch base.\n\n===Heavy Metal System (HMS)===\n'''Beyblade HMS''' ('''Hard Metal System''') is a line of Beyblade toys released after the Engine Gear line of blades with respect to the [[anime]] series. This series, unlike ones in the past, use smaller pieces made mostly of metal. HMS Beyblades have a distinct advantage over previously released Beyblades, that being that their spin velocities are 1.5-2&times; faster.\n\nThese tops are composed of a four-layer part system:\n\n* '''Bit Protector''': This holds the parts together, unlike its plastic counterpart, the Bit Chip, which was merely decorative. With the release of the first 5 HMS Beyblades, 2 different stickers for made for the Bit Protector, one of a \"bit beast\" and one of the emblem. The emblem stickers were the only ones that appeared in later Beyblade toys.\n* '''Attack Ring''': This is composed of an inner metal part screwed to an outer ABS caul. Typically there would be a ring made of plastic that connected to the second ring made of metal. The attack rings were fashioned in many different styles.\n* '''Weight Disk''': HMS Weight Disks are completely round, unlike plastic Weight Disks which were shaped as Hexa-, octa-, and decagons. There are also Customizable Weight Disks, which have plastic and metal parts, the plastic parts giving the Weight Disk a certain feature.\n* '''Running Core''': The Blade Base of HMS. It goes through the weight disk & attack ring and attaches to the Bit Protector. This piece also replaces the Spin Gear/Engine Gear. Spin direction is now determined entirely by which launcher is used.\n\n====Beyblade Metal System (Pre-HWS)====\n* ''Face Bolt'': A screw which holds the bey together\n* ''Wheel'': A metal piece that makes up the main point of contact against the opposing Beyblade, and allows you to launch.\n* ''Track/Spin Track'': The part of the bey which connects to the face and helps to hold the top together. It also defines the height of the top.\n* ''Performance Tip'': The driver will change the spin patterns of the top as well as its stamina in battle. Flatter tips will cause Beys to behave more aggressively, while pointed ones create a stable, calm spin pattern.\n\n===Hybrid Wheel System (HWS)===\nThis system was released in 2008 in Japan and in 2010 worldwide. It was rebranded as the Performance Top System in Hasbro markets. It introduces new components making the Beyblades more complex, including a wheel made of [[polycarbonate]] and a wider variety of bottoms. These kinds of Beyblades were sold under the ''[[Beyblade: Metal Fusion]]'' brand. All parts of an HWS Beyblade are plastic except for the Fusion Wheel. A socket wrench like Tool is used to assemble the Beyblade, locking the Face Bolt and Performance Tip to the Spin Track. The main difference from the earlier Metal System is the replacement of the lone die-cast Wheel with a combination of a plastic \u201dEnergy Ring/Clear Wheel\u201d and \u201dMetal/Fusion Wheel\u201d. This was done to prevent the breakage of launcher parts.\n\nNames of Beyblades can now be determined by their parts. For example, Storm Pegasus 105RF has a 'Pegasus' Energy Ring/Clear Wheel, 'Storm' Fusion Wheel/Metal Wheel, '105(10.5mm)' Spin Track/Track, and an 'RF (Rubber Flat)' Bottom/Performance Tip.\n\n====4D System====\n4D system Beyblades were introduced in March 2011. It is an expansion of the Hybrid Wheel System which introduced new parts including the 4D Fusion Wheel and 4D Bottom. Additionally, the plastic parts of the wheels are made of a heavier, stronger material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ameblo.jp/ginta-mixx8/image-10797502724-11041212148.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092427/http://ameblo.jp/ginta-mixx8/image-10797502724-11041212148.html |archivedate=2011-02-22 |language=ja}}</ref>\n\nThe 4D Fusion Wheel replaces the standard Fusion Wheel. It is made of multiple parts, including the PC Frame, Metal Frame, and Core. Some omit a standard frame and core design, such as L-Drago Destroy which has an upper metal frame to replace the Energy Ring and a lower PC core with rubber inserts to replace the Fusion Wheel, essentially flipping the common construction of most tops from this system.\n\nThe 4D Bottom replaces the Spin Track and includes a built-in gimmick involving the tip, such as being quickly changed between battles without disassembly, changing performance based on stamina, or spinning freely on a bearing.\n\n====Zero-G System====\nThe Zero-G System continues the trend of the Hybrid Wheel System by using compatible parts. In uses the same engineering for the Spin Track and Performance Tip while introducing parts that can be used in place of others. The Crystal Wheel and Warrior/Chrome Wheel replace the Fusion Wheel and Energy Ring, while a similar but slightly longer Face Bolt is used due to the extra thickness of the new wheels. Stadiums for this system have rounded bottoms that cause them to pivot, which changes the movement patterns of the battling Beyblades. Additionally, the Crystal Wheel may be replaced with a second Warrior Wheel to create a heavier Synchrome Beyblade. \n\n\nSamauri Pegasus Has a Warrior/synchrome Wheel And Bottom Energy Layer.\nand And a W105R2F Spin track\n\n===Burst System===\nThis system is designed in such a way that the top may separate if it has sustained enough hits, which creates a burst gimmick due to a spring in the Performance Tip. The Burst System consists of 3 parts: \n\n*'''Energy Layer''': The top part of the Beyblade, it is the part where the launcher attaches as well as where most contact during battles takes place. They consist of a two-piece polycarbonate disk. Those that have inner layers with exposed edges are called Dual Layers. A later upgrade called the God Layer System in Japan and SwitchStrike in Hasbro releases introduced multi-piece Layers with gimmicks similar to earlier series. ''Beyblade Burst Cho-Z'' succeeded the God Layer System and contains metal and has a more ornate design. The metal was omitted for the Hasbro release as ''Beyblade Burst: Turbo'' but still follows the designs of the Japanese toys. They can also be fitted beneath the layer with a Level Chip, which reduces problems from the bey. (Only Turbo and some layers do not support this.) In Beyblade Burst Rise, the layer is now a 3 piece part with the Gatinko Chip, Weight, and Base. The Gatinko Chip provides the teeth needed to keep the layer together, the Layer Weight imitates the Forge Disk and adds weight to the layer, and the Layer Base provides the shape of the Beyblade, and what abilities it has. Hasbro Slingshock layers have no metal on them and is replaced by white plastic with the only exception being Xcalius X4.\n\n*'''Forge Disc''': Analogous to the Weight Disc from the original series, it provides much of the weight and how that weight is distributed across the Beyblade. In the two initial years, the disks were only metal with some of them having plastic. This is the case with most GT beys as well. The release of the SwitchStrike tops saw the release Two-Part Forge Discs which could fit a plastic part underneath the disk, called a Frame. They provide minor amounts of weight, but are primarily used to affect how well the Beyblade spins while knocked over, dubbed Life After Death by the community, or lower the center of gravity with a select few of the frames. A few disks have received upgraded forms marked by an apostrophe (ie. 8' and 1').\n\n*'''Performance Tip''': This component serves as the base of the Beyblade top upon which supports the other components as well as point of contact for the stadium floor. Drivers affect the agility, balance, and movement speed based on their shape. Starting with ''Beyblade Burst: Turbo'', Hasbro added their own variations of Drivers which can extend for extra height and speed as part of the SlingShock system. Takara Tomy has also added the upgraded ' (Dash) versions to certain drivers, mainly ones labeled as Attack and Balance types with one exception in Keep' being a defence driver. Dash drivers give more burst resistance and are marked red above the spring to not get mistaken for an normal driver.\n\n===Extreme Battle System===\nThe Extreme Battle System released by Hasbro in ''Beyblade: Metal Masters''. They are separated into four groups, \"Tornado Battlers\" (taller, all plastic), \"Electro Battlers\" (light and sound effects), \"IR Spin Control Beyblades\" (remote controlled), and \u00a8Stealth Battlers\u00a8 (hidden weapons released by [[centripetal force]]). None of these can be customized.\n\n===Beyblade Burst Micro===\n''Beyblade Burst Micro'' is a miniature scale version of the main ''Beyblade Burst'' series sold by Hasbro. Because of their small size, the tops can only be customized by changing the tips.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/product/beyblade-micros-battle-set:A02001FA-5056-9047-F596-8C9B59A1A7D9 |title=Beyblade Burst Micro |work=Product Description on Hasbro Website |format=[[MediaWiki]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Battling Tops]]\n* [[Spinja]]\n* [[Ninjago]]\n* [[Spin Fighters]]\n* [[Battle Strikers]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<br />\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.beyblade.com}}\n\n{{Beyblade}}\n{{Hasbro}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beyblade (Toy)}}\n[[Category:Beyblade]]\n[[Category:Hasbro products]]\n[[Category:2000s toys]]\n[[Category:Tops]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:2000s fads and trends]]\n[[Category:NewBoy]]\n[[Category:Muay Thai in anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Spinning toy}}\n{{About|the line of spinning top toys|the manga series|Beyblade (manga)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=July 2012}}\n{{overly detailed|date=July 2012}}\n{{advert|date=February 2012}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox Toy\n|image=\n|name=Beyblade\n|type=[[Spinning top]]\n|from=1999\n|to=present\n|inventor=\n|company=[[Takara Tomy]]\n[[Hasbro]]\n|website=\n|country=[[Japan]]\n|slogan=\n}}\n'''Beyblade''' (diminutive '''Bey''', from the diminutive of [[Beigoma]]) is the bestline of [[spinning top]] toys originally developed by [[Takara]] and manufactured by [[Tomy]], first released in Japan in July 1999. The main premise of the series is that the beyblade is customizable, with interchangeable parts.\n\nBoth the toys and their names were inspired by \"'''Beigoma'''\", a traditional spinning top.  The concept is similar to [[Battling Tops]], a board game developed by [[Ideal Toy Company]] in 1968. The toy line was introduced with an accompanying [[Beyblade (manga)|manga series of the same name]] in 1999. In 2002, [[Hasbro]] began to sell Beyblade toys internationally (under license from, and produced by, Takara) along with a coordinated country-by-country release of localized versions of the TV series. In August 2008, Takara Tomy released ''Beyblade: Metal Fusion''; the first incarnation of the toy in three and a half years.\n\nThe ''[[Beyblade Burst]]'' series debuted in 2015, followed by ''Beyblade Burst Evolution'', ''Beyblade Burst Turbo'', and most recently ''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (known to Takara Tomy as Beyblade Burst GT).\n\n==Game and rules==\nAside from informal play, a game with specific rules is published. The formal game is played with two players or more. Each player is allowed up to three Beyblades to choose from during a match. Players may use any parts available to them to make their Beyblades as long as they are not restricted (such as in tournament play), but may not switch parts once a match has started. Players may choose from any of the three Beyblades they have with them for any battle in a match. In Beyblade and The Metal saga series, the first player to 1 point wins. In Beyblade Burst, Beyblade Burst Evolution, Beyblade Burst Turbo, and Beyblade Burst Gachi, it is up to 2 or 3 points depending on the type of match. A normal match or a match that isn't the finals will most likely be up to 2 points. Final matches are up to 3 points. (In Beyblade Burst Evolution, in the God Bladers Cup (Japan) or International Bladers Cup (English dub), the semi-final was up to three points.)  A survivor finish is where one top has stopped spinning and the other top continues to spin. That is 1 point. A ring out finish is where a top falls into a hole called a pocket or flies out of the Beystadium. That is 1 point. A burst finish (Beyblade Burst series only) is where a beyblade top breaks into three pieces. That is two points. When a beyblade burst into 4 or more pieces that is 3 points(Takara Tomy does not support this). A Battle Royale is where three or more players play. The last top spinning wins.<ref>https://www.fun.be/media/Beyblade%20Burst%20Guide%20Book.pdf</ref>\n\nPoints are awarded to the player based on how their Beyblade knocks out their opponent's Beyblade: (names are different depending on where you come from, Japanese saying comes after English dub saying.)\n* One point is awarded if the opponent's Beyblade stops spinning (Survivor/Spin Finish).\n* One point is awarded if the opponent's Beyblade is knocked out of the stadium or into a trap on the edge of the ring (Ring Out/Over Finish).\n* Beginning with ''Beyblade Burst'', two points are awarded if the opponent's Beyblade bursts (hence the name) during a battle (Burst Finish).\n\nIn the event of a draw (both Beyblades are knocked out of the ring, stop spinning simultaneously, or burst at the same time), no points are awarded to either player.\n\n==Types of Beyblade toys==\n\nThe three main types of Beyblades have rock-paper-scissors style effectiveness, with Attack generally being weak to Defense, Defense to Stamina, and Stamina to Attack. However, due to the high variability of the custom designs, this is not a hard rule. Balance types may be strong or weak to any of the others depending on specific parts.\n\nAttack/Striker: These Beyblades specialize in attacking other Beyblades. They battle fiercely and try to knock out the other Beyblade as fast as they can. They tend to outperform Stamina-Type Beyblades due to their lack of defense.\n\nDefense/Defender: These Beyblades specialize in knocking back attacks. They tend to travel slowly and are heavier than other types, resulting in opponents being deflected. Their weight also causes them to launch slower, resulting in less stamina. They tend to wear down Attack-types but are outlasted by Stamina.\n\nStamina/Endurance: These Beyblades specialize in stamina. They are used so they can out-spin the enemy Bey and win. In exchange for a lack of power, their stamina lasts longer against other Type of Beyblades making them naturally advantageous over Defense-Types, which focus on resisting hits.\n\nBalance/Combination: These Beyblades specialize in a mix of the other three types listed above, giving them no glaring strengths or weaknesses. They use a mix of Attack, Defense, and Stamina Types put together to make an even mix to win.\n\n==Stadium==\n\nA special arena called a Beystadium is also sold. It is primarily a shallow plastic tub but may have other features dependent on the purpose of the particular stadium.\n\nDifferent stadiums were released in different markets. Takara Tomy and Sonokong produce Beystadiums similar to those featured in the manga, with open sections in the walls and openings on the sides to launch into. Hasbro produces stadiums with high walls and pockets that count as a ring-out instead.\n \nCommon features of a Beystadium include a shallow impression called a cyclone ridge, which allows Attack type Beyblades to move around quickly without accidentally knocking themselves out, and cyclone points, which are recessed disks in the stadium floor that spin freely to add randomness to a battle. Other features may be specific to the series that the Beystadium is released in, like outer Rail sections in the ''Beyblade Burst: Turbo'' being meant for SlingShock Beyblades (ex:Forneus F4) to move around the outside of the stadium before returning in a straight line toward a certain point if slingshock mode is activated, in Beyblade Burst Rise, the HyperSphere Stadium, meant for HyperSphere Beyblades (ex:Air knight K5) where the performance tip are very round to ride the rails and strike the enemy Beyblade. The HyperSphere and slingshock stadiums are both made by Hasbro. Both of the stadiums said are inspired from the Beyblade Burst anime.\nA Beyblade Launcher is use to launch the beyblade in the battle. There\u2019s more powerful launchers that work better. (ex:Xcalius sword launcher).\nTT (Takara Tomy) do not sell HyperSphere or slingshock.\n\n==System==\nThe \"Basic System\" tops are the first generation of [[Beyblade]] tops. They are made entirely of [[plastic]], with the exception of Weight Disks and some tips. These Beyblades consist of four basic parts:\n\n*'''Bit Chip''': A decorative plate inserted into the Attack Ring of the Beyblade, adorned with a small icon of a mythical creature. In the manga, these creatures' souls were housed in the Beyblades themselves. Later Beyblades included a clear Bit Protector that prevented damage to the Bit Chip.\n* ''' Attack Ring ''': The Attack Ring determines the blade's effect when it impacts against its opponent, as this is normally the first part to come into contact with the opposing blade. Also, the Attack Ring holds the Bit Chip in place on the top, preventing it from coming off mid-battle.\n* ''' Weight Disk ''': A metal disk that adds weight to the bey and determines its weight distribution and much of its total weight.\n* ''' Blade Base ''': The Blade Base determines how the Beyblade spins and also affects its movement pattern. A Spin Gear on later releases determines the direction of the Beyblade's rotation; either clockwise (right) or counterclockwise (left) dependent on which Spin Gear/Spin Gear Casings is/are used. The BB is attached to the AR.\n\n===Magnacore System (MG)===\nIntroduced with the V-series, the \"Magnacore\" line of Beyblade toys featured magnetic Spin Gears and Weight Disks to attract or repel blades from each other. Additionally, certain Beystadiums had points to attach magnets, which affected the movement pattern.\n\n===Engine Gear System (EG)===\n'''Engine Gear''' tops were introduced with the G-series, and retain the same major design of a typical Beyblade, including a Bit Piece, an Attack Ring, a Weight Disk, and a Blade Base; Engine Gear tops, however, replace the typical Spin Gear with a more advanced Engine Gear, which affects the movement of the top during the battle. Each Engine Gear includes a '''Turbo Winder''' to wind-up the engine core. When in action, the Blade Base releases the Engine Gear determined by the Blade Base's clutch lock system. This series of Beyblades were the last ones to be made of plastic parts with the exception of the weight disks. The later ones were semi-metal or completely metal.\n\n====Engine gear types====\n* '''Engine Gear''': The default engine gear that comes with most Beyblades in G-revolution, but their tip is varied.\n* '''Turbo Engine Gear''': First released with the left-spinning Dragoon GT, the Turbo Engine Gear gives an even more powerful release than that of the original engine gear that comes with a larger turbo winder.\n* '''Reverse Gear''': The Engine Gear spins in the opposite direction of the rest of the top. This engine gear is only bundled with Dranzer gt, which uses this gear for a reverse zig-zag attack. Although this attack can be very effective, the Beyblade loses spin when the gear kicks in. As with Dragoon GT, it comes with a larger turbo winder.\n* '''Gyro Engine Gear''': This unique type allows the tip of the Beyblade to spin independently. Thus the Beyblade can be launched without a launcher, as a ripcord can be inserted into the Beyblade.\n\n====Blade base types====\n* '''Instant Release''' or '''First Clutch''': The Engine Gear triggers at the beginning of the battle, resulting in a type a large burst of speed almost immediately after launch.\n* '''Steady Release''': The Engine Gear triggers at the beginning of the battle, but releases earlier because of the weight of Kwa'Hit Release''' or '''Final Clutch''': The Engine Gear triggers when the blade base collides with an object, or when the Beyblade is running out of spin, and releases a quick burst of speed. The clutches must be pulled before winding the spin gear.\n* '''Middle Clutch''': Built exclusively for Dranzer GT, the middle clutch has a similar design to the Final Clutch Base, but releases the engine gear in the middle of the match; earlier than a final clutch but not instant as in the First Clutch base.\n\n===Heavy Metal System (HMS)===\n'''Beyblade HMS''' ('''Hard Metal System''') is a line of Beyblade toys released after the Engine Gear line of blades with respect to the [[anime]] series. This series, unlike ones in the past, use smaller pieces made mostly of metal. HMS Beyblades have a distinct advantage over previously released Beyblades, that being that their spin velocities are 1.5-2&times; faster.\n\nThese tops are composed of a four-layer part system:\n\n* '''Bit Protector''': This holds the parts together, unlike its plastic counterpart, the Bit Chip, which was merely decorative. With the release of the first 5 HMS Beyblades, 2 different stickers for made for the Bit Protector, one of a \"bit beast\" and one of the emblem. The emblem stickers were the only ones that appeared in later Beyblade toys.\n* '''Attack Ring''': This is composed of an inner metal part screwed to an outer ABS caul. Typically there would be a ring made of plastic that connected to the second ring made of metal. The attack rings were fashioned in many different styles.\n* '''Weight Disk''': HMS Weight Disks are completely round, unlike plastic Weight Disks which were shaped as Hexa-, octa-, and decagons. There are also Customizable Weight Disks, which have plastic and metal parts, the plastic parts giving the Weight Disk a certain feature.\n* '''Running Core''': The Blade Base of HMS. It goes through the weight disk & attack ring and attaches to the Bit Protector. This piece also replaces the Spin Gear/Engine Gear. Spin direction is now determined entirely by which launcher is used.\n\n====Beyblade Metal System (Pre-HWS)====\n* ''Face Bolt'': A screw which holds the bey together\n* ''Wheel'': A metal piece that makes up the main point of contact against the opposing Beyblade, and allows you to launch.\n* ''Track/Spin Track'': The part of the bey which connects to the face and helps to hold the top together. It also defines the height of the top.\n* ''Performance Tip'': The driver will change the spin patterns of the top as well as its stamina in battle. Flatter tips will cause Beys to behave more aggressively, while pointed ones create a stable, calm spin pattern.\n\n===Hybrid Wheel System (HWS)===\nThis system was released in 2008 in Japan and in 2010 worldwide. It was rebranded as the Performance Top System in Hasbro markets. It introduces new components making the Beyblades more complex, including a wheel made of [[polycarbonate]] and a wider variety of bottoms. These kinds of Beyblades were sold under the ''[[Beyblade: Metal Fusion]]'' brand. All parts of an HWS Beyblade are plastic except for the Fusion Wheel. A socket wrench like Tool is used to assemble the Beyblade, locking the Face Bolt and Performance Tip to the Spin Track. The main difference from the earlier Metal System is the replacement of the lone die-cast Wheel with a combination of a plastic \u201dEnergy Ring/Clear Wheel\u201d and \u201dMetal/Fusion Wheel\u201d. This was done to prevent the breakage of launcher parts.\n\nNames of Beyblades can now be determined by their parts. For example, Storm Pegasus 105RF has a 'Pegasus' Energy Ring/Clear Wheel, 'Storm' Fusion Wheel/Metal Wheel, '105(10.5mm)' Spin Track/Track, and an 'RF (Rubber Flat)' Bottom/Performance Tip.\n\n====4D System====\n4D system Beyblades were introduced in March 2011. It is an expansion of the Hybrid Wheel System which introduced new parts including the 4D Fusion Wheel and 4D Bottom. Additionally, the plastic parts of the wheels are made of a heavier, stronger material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ameblo.jp/ginta-mixx8/image-10797502724-11041212148.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092427/http://ameblo.jp/ginta-mixx8/image-10797502724-11041212148.html |archivedate=2011-02-22 |language=ja}}</ref>\n\nThe 4D Fusion Wheel replaces the standard Fusion Wheel.

However, Max chooses his family and becomes a superhero instead by helping them take down Dark Mayhem.\n\nDuring the fourth season, Max and Phoebe, under their Thunder Twins team-up, are selected as candidates for membership to the elite Hero League team called the Z-Force. Halfway through the season, Phoebe accidentally absorbs Dark Mayhem's powers, which turn her evil, but her family saves her. At the end, Phoebe and Max become the new Z-Force leaders and enroll the Thundermans as members.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of The Thundermans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Thundermans episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of The Thundermans characters}}\n\n* [[Kira Kosarin]] as Phoebe Thunderman\n* [[Jack Griffo]] as Max Thunderman\n* Addison Riecke as Nora Thunderman\n* Diego Velazquez as Billy Thunderman\n* [[Chris Tallman]] as Hank Thunderman\n* [[Rosa Blasi]] as Barb Thunderman\n* Maya Le Clark as Chloe Thunderman (recurring, season 3; main, season 4)\n\n== Production ==\nOn August 3, 2012, Nickelodeon announced ''The Thundermans'' as one of its upcoming live-action series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Announces New Series & Pilots|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/08/nickelodeon-announces-new-series-pilots/|work=Deadline|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=August 3, 2012|access-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> Shooting began in mid-February and extras were cast at that time and throughout the production at [[Paramount Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twicsy.com/i/y6z5Vd|title=ChrisFabregas: Coming to You Live from a Taping of the #Thundermans at Paramount Studios!|work=Twicsy|date=July 13, 2013|access-date=November 5, 2013}}</ref> Its pilot was shot in October 2012.<ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/02/nickelodeon-pilot-the-thundermans-picked-up-to-series-a-young-lead-recast/|title=Nickelodeon Pilot The Thundermans Picked Up to Series, a Young Lead Recast|work=Deadline|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=February 14, 2013|access-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowauditions.info/2013/01/nickelodeon-auditions-and-casting-for.html|title=Nickelodeon Auditions and Casting for New Series The Thundermans|work=TV Show Auditions|access-date=March 31, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821092834/http://www.tvshowauditions.info/2013/01/nickelodeon-auditions-and-casting-for.html|archive-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref> On December 20, 2013, the series was renewed for a second season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-thundermans-nickelodeon-orders-season-two-31038/|title=The Thundermans: Nickelodeon Orders Season 2|work=TV Series Finale|date=December 20, 2013|access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref> The second season premiered on September 13, 2014.

The series stars [[Kira Kosarin]], [[Jack Griffo]], Addison Riecke, Diego Velazquez, [[Chris Tallman]], [[Rosa Blasi]], and Maya Le Clark, and features the voice of [[Dana Snyder]] as Dr. Colosso.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe series revolves around the Thundermans, a family with superpowers who try to live normal lives in the fictional town of Hiddenville. Phoebe dreams of being a [[superhero]] and using her powers for good, while her twin brother Max wants to be the next big [[supervillain]] and use his powers for evil. Parents Hank and Barb attempt to live normal lives and not use their superpowers \u2013 albeit not very successfully \u2013 while Nora and Billy enjoy using theirs whenever possible. A former supervillain named Dr. Colosso has been [[transmogrified]] into a rabbit and lives in Max's lair in the basement, offering him advice on becoming a villain. \n\nAt the end of the second season, Chloe is introduced as the baby sister.\n\nDuring the third season, Phoebe starts training to become a superhero, while the master super villain, Dark Mayhem, trains Max to become a villain. At the end of the season, Dark Mayhem asks Max to prove he is a villain by taking away Phoebe's powers. However, Max chooses his family and becomes a superhero instead by helping them take down Dark Mayhem.\n\nDuring the fourth season, Max and Phoebe, under their Thunder Twins team-up, are selected as candidates for membership to the elite Hero League team called the Z-Force. Halfway through the season, Phoebe accidentally absorbs Dark Mayhem's powers, which turn her evil, but her family saves her. At the end, Phoebe and Max become the new Z-Force leaders and enroll the Thundermans as members.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of The Thundermans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Thundermans episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of The Thundermans characters}}\n\n* [[Kira Kosarin]] as Phoebe Thunderman\n* [[Jack Griffo]] as Max Thunderman\n* Addison Riecke as Nora Thunderman\n* Diego Velazquez as Billy Thunderman\n* [[Chris Tallman]] as Hank Thunderman\n* [[Rosa Blasi]] as Barb Thunderman\n* Maya Le Clark as Chloe Thunderman (recurring, season 3; main, season 4)\n\n== Production ==\nOn August 3, 2012, Nickelodeon announced ''The Thundermans'' as one of its upcoming live-action series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Announces New Series & Pilots|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/08/nickelodeon-announces-new-series-pilots/|work=Deadline|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=August 3, 2012|access-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> Shooting began in mid-February and extras were cast at that time and throughout the production at [[Paramount Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twicsy.com/i/y6z5Vd|title=ChrisFabregas: Coming to You Live from a Taping of the #Thundermans at Paramount Studios!|work=Twicsy|date=July 13, 2013|access-date=November 5, 2013}}</ref> Its pilot was shot in October 2012.<ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/02/nickelodeon-pilot-the-thundermans-picked-up-to-series-a-young-lead-recast/|title=Nickelodeon Pilot The Thundermans Picked Up to Series, a Young Lead Recast|work=Deadline|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=February 14, 2013|access-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowauditions.info/2013/01/nickelodeon-auditions-and-casting-for.html|title=Nickelodeon Auditions and Casting for New Series The Thundermans|work=TV Show Auditions|access-date=March 31, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821092834/http://www.tvshowauditions.info/2013/01/nickelodeon-auditions-and-casting-for.html|archive-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref> On December 20, 2013, the series was renewed for a second season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-thundermans-nickelodeon-orders-season-two-31038/|title=The Thundermans: Nickelodeon Orders Season 2|work=TV Series Finale|date=December 20, 2013|access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref> The second season premiered on September 13, 2014.

After training in the United States with [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s, it deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], where it engaged in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign against Germany]].  After [[V-E Day]], the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated.\n\nThe squadron was activated in the [[military reserve force|reserve]] in 1948, but was inactivated in 1949 budget reductions.  It was [[mobilization|mobilied]] for the [[Korean War]] in 1951, but its personnel were used as fillers for other units and it was inactivated shortly after mobilization. The squadron again became a reserve unit in 1955 as the '''705th Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  It served as an airlift unit in the reserve until 1968, when it became a combat crew training unit as the  '''705th Tactical Airlift Squadron''' (CCTS).\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n====Training for combat====\n[[Image:446th-b24s1.jpg|thumb|446th Bomb Group Liberators on their way to a target. Identifiable is B-24H Liberator 42-7607.]]\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated on 1 April 1943 at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona as the '''705th Bombardment Squadron''' with an initial [[cadre (military)|cadre]] drawn from the [[39th Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Maurer705BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 709-710</ref><ref name=Castens20>Castens, p. 20</ref> It was one of the original squadrons of the [[446th Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Maurer705BS/></ref><ref name=Maurer446BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 320\u2013321</ref><ref name=706BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 710</ref><ref name=707BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 710\u2013711</ref> The cadre departed for [[Orlando Army Air Base]], Florida for training with the [[Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics]], where they flew simulated combat missions from [[Montbrook Army Air Field]].<ref name=Castens20/>\n\nThe unit headed for [[Alamogordo Army Air Field]], New Mexico in June 1943, but was diverted to [[Lowry Field]], Colorado, where the squadron was filled out and advanced training was completed. The squadron lost one aircraft during this training.<ref>Castens, pp. 22\u201323</ref> The ground echelon left Lowry on 18 October 1943 for [[Camp Shanks]], New York and embarked on the {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, sailing on 27 October 1943 and arrived in [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] on 2 November 1943. The aircraft left Lowry on 20 October 1943 for staging at [[Lincoln Air Force Base|Lincoln Army Air Field]], Nebraska. The [[aircrew]]s ferried their planes under the control of [[Air Transport Command]] via the southern route from Florida through Puerto Rico, Brazil, Senegal, and Morocco to England. The 705th was part of the first [[United States Army Air Forces]] group to complete the Transatlantic hop from Brazil to Africa without the installation of additional [[bomb bay]] fuel tanks.<ref>Castens, pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\n====Combat in the European Theater====\n[[Image:446th-b24s2.jpg|thumb|446th Bomb Group Liberators on their way to a target. Identifiable is B-24J Liberator 42-100360. This aircraft was shot down 29 April 1944 on mission to Berlin.]]\nThe squadron arrived at its new base at [[RAF Flixton]]<ref group=note>The station was referred to as Flixton by the Army Air Forces, but was also known as RAF Bungay.</ref> in the east of England in October.<ref name=bungay>{{PastScape|mnumber=1389350 |mname=Bungay airfield|accessdate= 21 January 2013}}</ref> The 705th flew its first mission on 16 December 1943 against shipping facilities in [[Bremen]].<ref>Castens, p. 38</ref> The unit operated chiefly against [[strategic bombing|strategic objectives]].  Its targets included [[U-boat]] installations at [[Kiel]], the port at [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], a chemical plant at [[Ludwigshafen]], [[ball-bearing]] works at [[Berlin]], aircraft engine plants at [[Rostock]], aircraft factories at [[Munich]], marshalling yards at [[Coblenz]], motor works at [[Ulm]], and oil refineries at [[Hamburg]].<ref name=Maurer446BG/>\n\nBesides strategic missions, the 705th often carried out [[close Air Support]] and [[air interdiction]] operations. It supported [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, in June 1944 by attacking strong points, bridges, [[airfield]]s, transportation, and other targets in France. The squadron aided ground forces at [[Caen]] and [[Saint-L\u00f4]] during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. It dropped supplies to Allied troops near [[Nijmegen]] during [[Operation Market-Garden]] in September. The unit bombed [[marshalling yard]]s, bridges, and road junctions during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944 and January 1945. It flew low level missions to drop medical supplies, arms, and food to airborne and ground troops near [[Wesel]] during [[Operation Varsity]] in March 1945.<ref name=Maurer446BG/><ref>Castens, p. 98</ref> The 705th flew its last combat mission on 25 April, attacking a bridge near [[Salzburg]], Austria.<ref name=Maurer446BG/>\n\nAfter [[V-E Day]], the 705th flew transport missions to France, sometimes landing at fields that had been targets the previous year.  It also flew \"Trolley\" missions, transporting support personnel for \"sightseeing\" trips over Germany to view the results of their efforts.<ref>Castens, p. 105</ref> The squadron began to redeploy to the US in June 1945. The first aircraft of the air echelon departed the United Kingdom in mid-June 1945 flying the northern route via Iceland.  The ground echelon sailed from Greenock on the ''Queen Mary'' on the sixth of July 1945 and arrived in New York on 11 July 1945. Personnel were given 30 days leave.  The ground and air echelons reassembled at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota in late July.  It was inactivated on 28 August 1945.<ref name=Maurer705BS/><ref>Castens, pp. 154, 157</ref>\n\n===Air Force reserve===\n====Corollary unit====\nThe '''705th Bombardment Squadron''' was activated again under [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) in the [[military reserve force|reserves]] in March 1948 at [[Carswell Air Force Base]], Texas.  Shortly after the squadron was activated, in July 1948, [[Continental Air Command]] (ConAC) assumed reserve training responsibility from ADC.  It was nominally a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombardment squadron, although it is not certain that it was equipped or fully manned.<ref>''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 709-710 (no aircraft listed)</ref>  The May 1949 Air Force Reserve program called for a new type of unit, the Corollary Unit, which was a reserve unit integrated with an active duty unit.  The plan was viewed as the best method to train reservists by mixing them with an existing regular unit to perform duties alongside the regular unit.<ref>Cantwell, p. 73</ref>  The squadron became a \"Heavy\" unit in June 1949<ref name=Maurer705BS/> and a corollary of the [[7th Bombardment Wing]], which was the regular combat wing at Carswell.  In May 1951, the squadron was [[mobilization|mobilized]] for the [[Korean War]], as were all reserve corollary units, and its personnel were used as fillers for other units, while the squadron was inactivated on 25 June.<ref name=Maurer705BS/><ref>Cantwell, p. 87</ref>\n\n====Airlift operations at Ellington====\n[[File:Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar 53-3156.jpg|thumb|C-119G Flying Boxcar as flown by the squadron]]\nReserve flying organizations began to be reformed in July 1952.<ref>Cantwell, p. 139</ref>  However, the Air Force desired that all reserve units be designed to augment the regular forces in the event of a national emergency.  The six reserve pilot training wings, including the 8706th Pilot Training Wing at [[Ellington Air Force Base]], Texas, however, had no mobilization mission.  On 18 May 1955, the 8706th Wing was discontinued and replaced by the [[446th Troop Carrier Wing]].<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW>Ravenstein, pp. 242-244</ref><ref>Cantwell, p. 146</ref>  Along with [[Beechcraft C-45 Expeditor]]s inherited from the pilot training program, the squadron began training with [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s as the '''705th Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  By late 1956, about 150 [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s became surplus to the regular Air Force,<ref>Cantwell, p. 168</ref> and in 1957 the squadron converted to the C-119.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n\nIn the summer of 1956, the squadron participated in Operation Sixteen Ton during its two weeks of active duty training.  Sixteen Ton was performed entirely by reserve troop carrier units and moved [[United States Coast Guard]] equipment From [[Floyd Bennett Naval Air Station]] to [[Isla Grande Airport]] in Puerto Rico and [[San Salvador]] in the Bahamas.  After the success of  Operation Sixteen Ton, the squadron began to use inactive duty training periods for Operation Swift Lift, transporting high priority cargo for the air force and Operation Ready Swap, transporting aircraft engines, between [[Air Materiel Command]]'s depots.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 149-150</ref>  At Ellington, the squadron initially trained with the 2578th Air Force Reserve Flying Center, but in 1958, the center was inactivated and some of its personnel were absorbed by the squadron.  Ellington was the first base to use the [[Air Reserve Technician Program]], in which a cadre of the unit consisted of full time personnel who were simultaneously civilian employees of the Air Force and held rank as members of the reserves.<ref>Cantwell, p. 163</ref>   In 1958 it was assigned directly to the [[446th Troop Carrier Wing]] when ConAC converted its reserve units to the dual deputy organization, which eliminated operational and maintenance group headquarters.<ref group=note>Under this plan flying squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Operations and maintenance squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Maintenance</ref> The group's squadrons were reassigned directly to the Wing.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n\nSince 1955, the reserve flying force included squadrons that were not located with their parent wings, but were spread over Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 156, 169</ref>  However, under this concept, support organizations remained with the wing.<ref>Cantwell, p. 156</ref>   Although the dispersal of flying units under the Detached Squadron Concept was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.  This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]].<ref name=Cantwell189>Cantwell, pp. 189-191</ref>  To resolve this, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons at the start of 1962.  However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the [[Cuban missile crisis]].  The formation of troop carrier groups was delayed until January 1963.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 189-191</ref>  This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.<ref name=Cantwell189/>   In January 1963, the [[925th Troop Carrier Group]] was activated as the [[headquarters]] for the 705th and its support elements.<ref name=Maurer705BS/>  \n\n====C-130 Hercules training school====\nThe squadron was one of the first reserve units to upgrade to the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]].   In March 1968, the squadron became a combat crew training unit as the demand for C-130 training increased with the conversion of other reserve units from the C-119.  As a training unit, it was no longer necessary to have associated support elements available for deployment support, so the 925th Group was inactivated and the squadron was once again assigned directly to the 446th Wing.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>  The squadron operated the USAF Combat Crew Training School (Tactical Airlift \u2013 C-130), and trained not only reservists, but members of the Air National Guard, regular Air Force and other military services using the Hercules.  The school was manned primarily by air reserve technicians, and was the first reserve unit to train active duty military.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n\nIn 1972, the squadron was briefly assigned to the [[433d Tactical Airlift Wing]] at [[Kelly Air Force Base]], Texas, when the 446th Wing inactivated, but was soon transferred to the remaining reserve headquarters at Ellington, the [[924th Tactical Airlift Group]].<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/><ref name=Ravenstein433TAW>Ravenstein, pp. 227-228</ref><ref name=924FGfacts>{{cite web |url= https://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432323/924-fighter-group-afrc/ |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 924 Fighter Group (AFRC)|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|url-status=live |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>  The squadron continued to train aircrews until 1976, when it was inactivated with the end of reserve flying operations at Ellington.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''705th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy) on 20 March 1943\n: Activated on 1 April 1943\n: Redesignated '''705th Bombardment Squadron''', Heavy on 20 August 1943\n: Inactivated on 28 August 1945\n* Redesignated '''705th Bombardment Squadron''', Very Heavy on 26 September 1947\n: Activated in the reserve on 26 March 1948\n: Redesignated '''705th Bombardment Squadron''', Heavy on 27 June 1949\n: Ordered to active service on 1 May 1951\n: Inactivated on 25 June 1951\n* Redesignated '''705th Troop Carrier Squadron''', Medium on 11 April 1955\n: Activated in the reserve on 25 May 1955<ref name=Maurer705BS2>Lineage, including assignments and stations, through March 1963 in Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 709\u2013710</ref>\n: Redesignated '''705th Tactical Airlift Squadron''' on 1 July 1967\n: Redesignated '''705th Tactical Airlift Squadron''' (CCTS)<ref group=note>Combat Crew Training Squadron</ref> on 25 March 1968\n: Redesignated '''705th Tactical Airlift Training Squadron''' on 1 June 1972\n: Inactivated on 30 June 1976\n\n===Assignments===\n* 446th Bombardment Group: 1 April 1943 \u2013 28 August 1945\n* 446th Bombardment Group: 26 March 1948 \u2013 25 June 1951\n* 446th Troop Carrier Group: 25 May 1955 \u2013 14 April 1959\n* 925th Troop Carrier Group (later Tactical Airlift Group): 17 January 1963<ref name=Maurer705BS2/>\n* 446th Tactical Airlift Wing: 25 March 1968<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n* [[433d Tactical Airlift Wing]]: 1 July 1972<ref name=Ravenstein433TAW/>\n* 924th Tactical Airlift Group: 1 September 1972 \u2013 30 June 1976<ref name=924FGfacts/>\n\n===Stations===\n* Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 1 April 1943\n* Lowry Field, Colorado,  8 June 1943 \u2013 c. 24 October 1943\n* RAF Flixton (AAF-125),<ref>Station code in Anderson.</ref> England, 4 November 1943 \u2013 5 July 1945\n* Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 15 July 1945 \u2013 28 August 1945\n* Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, 26 March 1948 \u2013 25 June 1951\n* Ellington Air Force Base (later Ellington Air Reserve Base), Texas, 25 May 1955 \u2013 30 June 1976<ref name=Maurer705BS2/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n* [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], 1943\u20131945<ref name=Maurer705BS/>\n* Curtiss C-46 Commando, 1955-1956<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n* Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, 1956\u20131967<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n* [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], 1967\u20131976\n\n===Awards and campaigns===\n{{unit awards table\n|award_image1=AF OUA\n|award_name1=[[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]]\n|award_date1=25 April 1968 \u2013 25 April 1970\n|award_notes1=705th Tactical Airlift Squadron<ref name=AFP9002>AF Pamphlet 900-2, p. 88</ref>\n|award_image2=AF OUA\n|award_name2=Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n|award_date2=26 April 1970 \u2013 31 December 1970\n|award_notes2=705th Tactical Airlift Squadron<ref name=AFP9002/>\n|award_image3=AF OUA\n|award_name3=Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n|award_date3=1 January 1971 \u2013 10 January 1972\n|award_notes3=705th Tactical Airlift Squadron<ref name=AFP9002/>\n}}\n\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

The squadron lost one aircraft during this training.<ref>Castens, pp. 22\u201323</ref> The ground echelon left Lowry on 18 October 1943 for [[Camp Shanks]], New York and embarked on the {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, sailing on 27 October 1943 and arrived in [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] on 2 November 1943. The aircraft left Lowry on 20 October 1943 for staging at [[Lincoln Air Force Base|Lincoln Army Air Field]], Nebraska. The [[aircrew]]s ferried their planes under the control of [[Air Transport Command]] via the southern route from Florida through Puerto Rico, Brazil, Senegal, and Morocco to England. The 705th was part of the first [[United States Army Air Forces]] group to complete the Transatlantic hop from Brazil to Africa without the installation of additional [[bomb bay]] fuel tanks.<ref>Castens, pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\n====Combat in the European Theater====\n[[Image:446th-b24s2.jpg|thumb|446th Bomb Group Liberators on their way to a target. Identifiable is B-24J Liberator 42-100360. This aircraft was shot down 29 April 1944 on mission to Berlin.]]\nThe squadron arrived at its new base at [[RAF Flixton]]<ref group=note>The station was referred to as Flixton by the Army Air Forces, but was also known as RAF Bungay.</ref> in the east of England in October.<ref name=bungay>{{PastScape|mnumber=1389350 |mname=Bungay airfield|accessdate= 21 January 2013}}</ref> The 705th flew its first mission on 16 December 1943 against shipping facilities in [[Bremen]].<ref>Castens, p. 38</ref> The unit operated chiefly against [[strategic bombing|strategic objectives]].  Its targets included [[U-boat]] installations at [[Kiel]], the port at [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], a chemical plant at [[Ludwigshafen]], [[ball-bearing]] works at [[Berlin]], aircraft engine plants at [[Rostock]], aircraft factories at [[Munich]], marshalling yards at [[Coblenz]], motor works at [[Ulm]], and oil refineries at [[Hamburg]].<ref name=Maurer446BG/>\n\nBesides strategic missions, the 705th often carried out [[close Air Support]] and [[air interdiction]] operations. It supported [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, in June 1944 by attacking strong points, bridges, [[airfield]]s, transportation, and other targets in France. The squadron aided ground forces at [[Caen]] and [[Saint-L\u00f4]] during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. It dropped supplies to Allied troops near [[Nijmegen]] during [[Operation Market-Garden]] in September. The unit bombed [[marshalling yard]]s, bridges, and road junctions during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944 and January 1945. It flew low level missions to drop medical supplies, arms, and food to airborne and ground troops near [[Wesel]] during [[Operation Varsity]] in March 1945.<ref name=Maurer446BG/><ref>Castens, p. 98</ref> The 705th flew its last combat mission on 25 April, attacking a bridge near [[Salzburg]], Austria.<ref name=Maurer446BG/>\n\nAfter [[V-E Day]], the 705th flew transport missions to France, sometimes landing at fields that had been targets the previous year.  It also flew \"Trolley\" missions, transporting support personnel for \"sightseeing\" trips over Germany to view the results of their efforts.<ref>Castens, p. 105</ref> The squadron began to redeploy to the US in June 1945. The first aircraft of the air echelon departed the United Kingdom in mid-June 1945 flying the northern route via Iceland.  The ground echelon sailed from Greenock on the ''Queen Mary'' on the sixth of July 1945 and arrived in New York on 11 July 1945. Personnel were given 30 days leave.  The ground and air echelons reassembled at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota in late July.  It was inactivated on 28 August 1945.<ref name=Maurer705BS/><ref>Castens, pp. 154, 157</ref>\n\n===Air Force reserve===\n====Corollary unit====\nThe '''705th Bombardment Squadron''' was activated again under [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) in the [[military reserve force|reserves]] in March 1948 at [[Carswell Air Force Base]], Texas.  Shortly after the squadron was activated, in July 1948, [[Continental Air Command]] (ConAC) assumed reserve training responsibility from ADC.  It was nominally a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombardment squadron, although it is not certain that it was equipped or fully manned.<ref>''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 709-710 (no aircraft listed)</ref>  The May 1949 Air Force Reserve program called for a new type of unit, the Corollary Unit, which was a reserve unit integrated with an active duty unit.  The plan was viewed as the best method to train reservists by mixing them with an existing regular unit to perform duties alongside the regular unit.<ref>Cantwell, p. 73</ref>  The squadron became a \"Heavy\" unit in June 1949<ref name=Maurer705BS/> and a corollary of the [[7th Bombardment Wing]], which was the regular combat wing at Carswell.  In May 1951, the squadron was [[mobilization|mobilized]] for the [[Korean War]], as were all reserve corollary units, and its personnel were used as fillers for other units, while the squadron was inactivated on 25 June.<ref name=Maurer705BS/><ref>Cantwell, p. 87</ref>\n\n====Airlift operations at Ellington====\n[[File:Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar 53-3156.jpg|thumb|C-119G Flying Boxcar as flown by the squadron]]\nReserve flying organizations began to be reformed in July 1952.<ref>Cantwell, p. 139</ref>  However, the Air Force desired that all reserve units be designed to augment the regular forces in the event of a national emergency.  The six reserve pilot training wings, including the 8706th Pilot Training Wing at [[Ellington Air Force Base]], Texas, however, had no mobilization mission.  On 18 May 1955, the 8706th Wing was discontinued and replaced by the [[446th Troop Carrier Wing]].<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW>Ravenstein, pp. 242-244</ref><ref>Cantwell, p. 146</ref>  Along with [[Beechcraft C-45 Expeditor]]s inherited from the pilot training program, the squadron began training with [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s as the '''705th Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  By late 1956, about 150 [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s became surplus to the regular Air Force,<ref>Cantwell, p. 168</ref> and in 1957 the squadron converted to the C-119.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n\nIn the summer of 1956, the squadron participated in Operation Sixteen Ton during its two weeks of active duty training.  Sixteen Ton was performed entirely by reserve troop carrier units and moved [[United States Coast Guard]] equipment From [[Floyd Bennett Naval Air Station]] to [[Isla Grande Airport]] in Puerto Rico and [[San Salvador]] in the Bahamas.  After the success of  Operation Sixteen Ton, the squadron began to use inactive duty training periods for Operation Swift Lift, transporting high priority cargo for the air force and Operation Ready Swap, transporting aircraft engines, between [[Air Materiel Command]]\u2019s depots.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 149-150</ref>  At Ellington, the squadron initially trained with the 2578th Air Force Reserve Flying Center, but in 1958, the center was inactivated and some of its personnel were absorbed by the squadron.  Ellington was the first base to use the [[Air Reserve Technician Program]], in which a cadre of the unit consisted of full time personnel who were simultaneously civilian employees of the Air Force and held rank as members of the reserves.<ref>Cantwell, p. 163</ref>   In 1958 it was assigned directly to the [[446th Troop Carrier Wing]] when ConAC converted its reserve units to the dual deputy organization, which eliminated operational and maintenance group headquarters.<ref group=note>Under this plan flying squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Operations and maintenance squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Maintenance</ref> The group's squadrons were reassigned directly to the Wing.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n\nSince 1955, the reserve flying force included squadrons that were not located with their parent wings, but were spread over Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 156, 169</ref>  However, under this concept, support organizations remained with the wing.<ref>Cantwell, p. 156</ref>   Although the dispersal of flying units under the Detached Squadron Concept was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.  This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]].<ref name=Cantwell189>Cantwell, pp. 189-191</ref>  To resolve this, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons at the start of 1962.  However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the [[Cuban missile crisis]].  The formation of troop carrier groups was delayed until January 1963.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 189-191</ref>  This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.<ref name=Cantwell189/>   In January 1963, the [[925th Troop Carrier Group]] was activated as the [[headquarters]] for the 705th and its support elements.<ref name=Maurer705BS/>  \n\n====C-130 Hercules training school====\nThe squadron was one of the first reserve units to upgraded to the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]].   In March 1968, the squadron became a combat crew training unit as the demand for C-130 training increased with the conversion of other reserve units from the C-119.  As a training unit, it was no longer necessary to have associated support elements available for deployment support, so the 925th Group was inactivated and the squadron was once again assigned directly to the 446th Wing.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>  The squadron operated the USAF Combat Crew Training School (Tactical Airlift \u2013 C-130), and trained not only reservists, but members of the Air National Guard, regular Air Force and other military services using the Hercules.  The school was manned primarily by air reserve technicians, and was the first reserve unit to train active duty military.<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n\nIn 1972, the squadron was briefly assigned to the [[433d Tactical Airlift Wing]] at [[Kelly Air Force Base]], Texas, when the 446th Wing inactivated, but was soon transferred to the remaining reserve headquarters at Ellington, the [[924th Tactical Airlift Group]].<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/><ref name=Ravenstein433TAW>Ravenstein, pp. 227-228</ref><ref name=924FGfacts>{{cite web |url= https://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432323/924-fighter-group-afrc/ |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 924 Fighter Group (AFRC)|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|url-status=live |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>  The squadron continued to train aircrews until 1976, when it was inactivated with the end of reserve flying operations at Ellington.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''705th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy) on 20 March 1943\n: Activated on 1 April 1943\n: Redesignated '''705th Bombardment Squadron''', Heavy on 20 August 1943\n: Inactivated on 28 August 1945\n* Redesignated '''705th Bombardment Squadron''', Very Heavy on 26 September 1947\n: Activated in the reserve on 26 March 1948\n: Redesignated '''705th Bombardment Squadron''', Heavy on 27 June 1949\n: Ordered to active service on 1 May 1951\n: Inactivated on 25 June 1951\n* Redesignated '''705th Troop Carrier Squadron''', Medium on 11 April 1955\n: Activated in the reserve on 25 May 1955<ref name=Maurer705BS2>Lineage, including assignments and stations, through March 1963 in Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 709\u2013710</ref>\n: Redesignated '''705th Tactical Airlift Squadron''' on 1 July 1967\n: Redesignated '''705th Tactical Airlift Squadron''' (CCTS)<ref group=note>Combat Crew Training Squadron</ref> on 25 March 1968\n: Redesignated '''705th Tactical Airlift Training Squadron''' on 1 June 1972\n: Inactivated on 30 June 1976\n\n===Assignments===\n* 446th Bombardment Group: 1 April 1943 \u2013 28 August 1945\n* 446th Bombardment Group: 26 March 1948 \u2013 25 June 1951\n* 446th Troop Carrier Group: 25 May 1955 \u2013 14 April 1959\n* 925th Troop Carrier Group (later Tactical Airlift Group): 17 January 1963<ref name=Maurer705BS2/>\n* 446th Tactical Airlift Wing: 25 March 1968<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n* [[433d Tactical Airlift Wing]]: 1 July 1972<ref name=Ravenstein433TAW/>\n* 924th Tactical Airlift Group: 1 September 1972 \u2013 30 June 1976<ref name=924FGfacts/>\n\n===Stations===\n* Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 1 April 1943\n* Lowry Field, Colorado,  8 June 1943 \u2013 c. 24 October 1943\n* RAF Flixton (AAF-125),<ref>Station code in Anderson.</ref> England, 4 November 1943 \u2013 5 July 1945\n* Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 15 July 1945 \u2013 28 August 1945\n* Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, 26 March 1948 \u2013 25 June 1951\n* Ellington Air Force Base (later Ellington Air Reserve Base), Texas, 25 May 1955 \u2013 30 June 1976<ref name=Maurer705BS2/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n* [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], 1943\u20131945<ref name=Maurer705BS/>\n* Curtiss C-46 Commando, 1955-1956<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n* Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, 1956\u20131967<ref name=Ravenstein446MAW/>\n* [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], 1967\u20131976\n\n===Awards and campaigns===\n{{unit awards table\n|award_image1=AF OUA\n|award_name1=[[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]]\n|award_date1=25 April 1968 \u2013 25 April 1970\n|award_notes1=705th Tactical Airlift Squadron<ref name=AFP9002>AF Pamphlet 900-2, p. 88</ref>\n|award_image2=AF OUA\n|award_name2=Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n|award_date2=26 April 1970 \u2013 31 December 1970\n|award_notes2=705th Tactical Airlift Squadron<ref name=AFP9002/>\n|award_image3=AF OUA\n|award_name3=Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n|award_date3=1 January 1971 \u2013 10 January 1972\n|award_notes3=705th Tactical Airlift Squadron<ref name=AFP9002/>\n}}\n\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
