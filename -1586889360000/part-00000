She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland (1923)]]\n[[File:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Carroll, Robinson - S119 - 'What day of the month is it' he said, turning to Alice.jpg|thumb|Mad tea party.

[[Leon Coward|Dr Leon Coward]] asserts the book 'suffers' from \"readings which reflect today's fascination with postmodernism and psychology, rather than delving into an historically informed interpretation,\" and speculates that this has been partly driven by audiences encountering the narrative through a 'second-hand' source, explaining \"our impressions of the original text are based on a multiplicity of reinterpretations. We don't necessarily realise we're missing anything in understanding the original product, because we're usually never dealing ''with'' the original product.\"<ref name=\"Coward 18\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nIt has been suggested by several people, including [[Martin Gardner]] and Selwyn Goodacre,<ref name=\"more_annotated\">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|url=https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363|title=More Annotated Alice|publisher=Random House|year=1990|isbn=978-0-394-58571-0|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363 363]}}</ref> that Dodgson had an interest in the French language, choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

We don't necessarily realise we're missing anything in understanding the original product, because we're usually never dealing ''with'' the original product.\"<ref name=\"Coward 18\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nIt has been suggested by several people, including [[Martin Gardner]] and Selwyn Goodacre,<ref name=\"more_annotated\">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|url=https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363|title=More Annotated Alice|publisher=Random House|year=1990|isbn=978-0-394-58571-0|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363 363]}}</ref> that Dodgson had an interest in the French language, choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Popular among London theatregoers, the play was frequently revived during Christmas season over the next four decades.]]\n\nThe first full major production of 'Alice' books during Carroll's lifetime was ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', an 1886 [[musical theatre|musical play]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] by H. Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.
