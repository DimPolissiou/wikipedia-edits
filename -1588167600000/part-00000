In contrast to most other [[Indo-European languages]], English does not retain [[grammatical gender]] and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el humano'') or grammatically feminine (as in [[French language|French]] ''la personne''), or sometimes grammatically neuter (as in [[German language|German]] ''das M\u00e4dchen''), regardless of the actual gender of the referent.\n\nIn addressing [[Grammatical_gender#Natural gender|natural gender]], English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker's attitude to the issue or the perceived [[Acceptance#Social acceptance|social acceptability]] of such strategies.\n\n==Debate==\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. \nMany people find non-neutral language to be offensive.<ref>{{cite web |last = Chappell |first = Virginia |title = Tips for Using Inclusive, Gender Neutral Language |work=Marquette.edu |date=2007 |url=http://www.marquette.edu/wac/neutral/NeutralInclusiveLanguage.shtml | accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way we think: it also shapes our thinking.

Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:\n<blockquote>\"As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth....\"\n</blockquote>\n\"If ''man'' and ''he'' were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been ''he has difficulties in childbirth''\", Miller and Swift comment.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=15}}</ref> Writing for the [[American Philosophical Association]], Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word ''man'' would be perceived as \"false, funny, or insulting\", offering as an example the sentence \"Some men are female.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Virginia L. |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language |url=https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]] |accessdate=29 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302025159/https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |archivedate=2 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurther, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of ''man'' has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=492}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] did not make the same distinction in declaring that \"all men are created equal\" and \"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].\" In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word ''men'' in its principal sense of ''males'', and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\"/>\n</blockquote>\nFor reasons like those above, proponents of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having ''man'' and ''men'' refer unambiguously to males, and ''human(s)'' or ''people'' to all persons;<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=493}}</ref> similarly, the word ''mankind'' replaced by ''humankind'' or ''humanity''<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=27}}</ref><!--\n\nIn gender-neutral language, when the description of defined genders has a practical need, the words \"Male and Female\" are often used as opposed to \"Men and Women\" in an attempt to make emphasis on the scientific features of male and female humans as opposed to cultural associations and baggage that may come with the words \"Men and Women\". {{clarification needed|date=January 2013}}-->\n\nThe use of the word ''man'' as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988\"/>\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Third-person pronoun#English}}\nAnother target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine [[English personal pronouns|pronoun]] ''he'' (and its derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself'') to refer to antecedents of [[Grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|indeterminate gender]]. Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to.

Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic.

Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to. The ''their'' there does not, in fact, have plural number, because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer at all.<ref>{{harvp|Pinker |2000}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSome [[style guide]]s {{which|date=April 2020}} accept singular ''they'' as grammatically correct,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage |last=Peters |first=Pam |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62181-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00pete_0 |ref= }}</ref> while others {{which|date=April 2020}} reject it.

[[Newspaper]]s such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' use gender-neutral language. Many law journals, psychology journals, and literature journals will only print articles or papers that use gender-inclusive language.<ref name=\"UPenn\" />\n\nEmployee policy manuals sometimes include strongly worded statements prescribing avoidance of language that potentially could be considered discriminatory.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]].

[[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Certainly in the 700s there was a [[Viking]] town there. Recent research has dated the building of the first city wall to 934. Aarhus must have been a town of some importance in the [[Viking Age]], as there are six [[Rune stone|runestones]] in or near the city. The name is known as Aros, Arus, Aarhus or Aars, as early as the 15th century. The city's charter of 1449 names it \"Aarss\". After the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]], the name \"Aarhus\" became current.\n\nAarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a [[Lumber|timber]] structure, was built during the reign of [[Frode]] King of Jutland around year 900 on top of the city's [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] in what was then the center of town.<ref name=VIKINGAROS>Damm, Annette. ''Viking Aros'' (2005) {{ISBN|87-87334-63-1}}.</ref> The first [[bishop]] was [[Reginbrand]], a [[missionary]] bishop of Aros in 948 under the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg]]. Aros came under the rule of the Archbishop of [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] in 1060. According to [[Adam of Bremen]], Aros was made a dependent [[diocese]] before 998.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16001a.htm  |title= Ancient See of Aarhus in Denmark|publisher =   New Advent|author=  Kevin Knight \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/bispesaede.htm  |title= Reginbrand er navnet p\u00e5 \u00c5rhus\u00b4 f\u00f8rste biskop|publisher =vikingemuseet    \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSt. Nikolai's church was the first [[cathedral]] of Aros. The second cathedral was a timber structure built in 1102 by bishop [[Ulfketil, Bishop of Aarhus|Ulfketil]] near the present site to house the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]].  St. Clement was an early Bishop of [[Rome]] who was [[martyr]]ed by having an [[anchor]] tied to his neck and thrown into the [[Black Sea]], according to a fictional biography of the saint.  Clement was the patron saint of [[sailor]]s and especially popular in [[Scandinavia]]. The first St. Clement's church burned at some point before the 1190s.  \n<ref>{{cite web|url =  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Pope_St._Clement_I |title=  Pope St. Clement I|publisher =  Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis timber church was the center of the local veneration of St. [[Niels of Aarhus]] (also called St. Nickolas). St. Niels was a younger son of [[Canute V of Denmark|King Canute V]].  As a young man, Prince Niels lost interest in life at [[court]] and withdrew to the village of Skibby near Aarhus and built a church with his own hands.  He lived a [[saint]]ly life and helped the people in the area around Aarhus.  One day, as he and a few men from the town were felling trees to build the church at [[Viby J|Viby]] near the sea, one of the men complained that he was thirsty. St. Niels prayed for water and a spring appeared to slake the man's thirst; St. Niels's Spring has run ever since.  It has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years and many miraculous healings are said to have taken place there, especially on [[Midsummer Day|St. John's Day]]. On his death bed in 1180, St. Niels asked to be buried in \"the little church by the sea\" (St. Clements). He was buried in the churchyard at St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0204.html|title= Hellig Niels|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Aarhus Cathedral===\nThe construction of Aarhus Cathedral began in the decade after year 1190, by Bishop [[Peder Vognsen]]  (d.11 April 1204) of the powerful [[Hvide]] family from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. Bishop Vognsen built the cathedral around St. Clement's church because local people venerated St. Niels, and Vognsen wanted to harness that devotion for his cathedral. Vognsen also established the [[cathedral school]] of [[Aarhus Katedralskole]], before the cathedral was completed. The church was finished in 1300 in typical [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style with half-rounded arches supporting a flat timber ceiling.  The second St. Clements was built of large red [[brick]]s, a new building material that became popular all over Scandinavia and [[northern Germany]] for ecclesiastical and public buildings.  Four [[chapel]]s were built into the north [[transept]]. The episcopal chair was moved from Our Lady Church to St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =   http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Peder_Vognsen|title= Peder Vognsen|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral altar back.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] (with paint restored in 1999), windows and the back of the [[altar]] in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nHowever, in 1330, the cathedral and much of the town burned down, and the church was abandoned until 1449. By then the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of architecture had reached Denmark, and the cathedral was enlarged in stages until it reached its present size in year 1500. The [[nave]] was lengthened to 93 meters, the longest in Denmark.  The transept was widened, and the typical [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] raised the ceilings and permitted high windows which fill the building with light.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed life in and around the cathedral in many significant ways. In 1524 [[Hans Tausen]] (1494\u20131561), the Danish [[Martin Luther|Luther]], taught a [[Good Friday]] sermon at Antvarskov Abbey proclaiming the doctrines of Luther.  His superior ordered him imprisoned in the [[Hospitallers]] monastery in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], Jutland.  Tausen taught from his cell and ordinary people responded with enthusiasm.  His superior tried to silence Tausen, but a near riot forced his release.  In the beginning, he was allowed to preach in the open air but his supporters broke open a [[Franciscan]] church, and soon Tausen had more followers than the church could accommodate.  Within a year, he was the king's own [[chaplain]].  Luther's ideas quickly spread to Aarhus and soon the townspeople demanded the right to hear the [[liturgy]] in Danish.  The bishop and [[Canon (priest)|canons]] attempted to stop the spread of the Lutheran doctrine in their [[diocese]], but Tausen had caught the imagination of the people and they would not be cowed by anything the bishop might threaten. Most nobles were staunchly [[Catholic]], and that brought even more support from common people.  By 1528 most of the cities had begun the process of reforming their churches. Tausen taught that tearing apart ancient churches was wrong and that orderly change should be used to reform the church.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Danske_folkekirke/Hans_Tausen|title=  Hans Tausen\n|publisher =  Den Store Danske, Gyldendal |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1533 [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederik I]] died and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: [[Thing (assembly)|''Landsting'']]), but the State Council denominated by the Catholic bishops refused to accept the election and called upon [[count]] [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to assist in restoring Catholic Christian II to the throne. This resulted in a two-year war called the [[Count's Feud]]. Despite the odds, Christian III prevailed and in the summer of 1536 arrested several of the bishops and threw them into prison. The last Roman Catholic Bishop of Aarhus, [[Ove Bille]] (d. 1555) was imprisoned in the summer of 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Ove_Bille|title= Ove Bille|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe tower is the tallest in Denmark at 96 meters.

Until the Reformation, most of the church's walls were covered in frescoes, of which many were lost. The cathedral still has 220 m<sup>2</sup> of frescoes, more than any other church in Denmark. One pre-1470 painting was saved from the first Romanesque-style cathedral in the northwest corner, the so-called ''Lazarus Window'', painted about 1300. It is believed that the window was used to give food to the [[leper]]s who weren't permitted inside the building.\n\nThe paintings of [[St Christopher]] and St Clement are the tallest in the country. Other figures include [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] and [[St George]] with the dragon (pictured, left).\n\nSt Clements only has one [[Stained glass|stained glass window]].  It was created by  [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] artist [[Emanuel Vigeland]] (1875\u20131948) in 1926. Its theme is taken from [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]]'s [[ hymn]] ''Da livtr\u00e6et f\u00e6stet i graven rod''. It stands 14 m high and is the largest stained glass window in all of Denmark. Three scenes are painted on the window: at the bottom, Christ's lying in his grave on [[Calvary|Golgotha]]; next, Christ crucified, and topmost, Christ standing in golden light. The most unusual feature is the [[Crucifixion]] scene, which (for an unknown reason) shows Jesus's head falling to the left, unlike traditional scenes which always show Jesus's head falling to the right.\n<ref>{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Emanuel_Vigeland|title= Emanuel Vigeland|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=  Nils Messel\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/writers/nikolai-frederik-severin-grundtvig |title= Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig\n|publisher =   Gyldendal Leksikon|author=  Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Altertavle-domkirken.jpg|thumb|left|Altar by [[Bernt Notke]]]]\n\n===The altar===\nThe cathedral has a wonderful altar piece (pictured, left) carved by the famous [[L\u00fcbeck]] sculptor and painter [[Bernt Notke]]) (c. 1440\u2013c. 1509).

Certainly in the 700s there was a [[Viking]] town there. Recent research has dated the building of the first city wall to 934. Aarhus must have been a town of some importance in the [[Viking Age]], as there are six [[Rune stone|runestones]] in or near the city. The name is known as Aros, Arus, Aarhus or Aars, as early as the 15th century. The city's charter of 1449 names it \"Aarss\". After the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]], the name \"Aarhus\" became current.\n\nAarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a [[Lumber|timber]] structure, was built during the reign of [[Frode]] King of Jutland around year 900 on top of the city's [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] in what was then the center of town.<ref name=VIKINGAROS>Damm, Annette.

The second cathedral was a timber structure built in 1102 by bishop [[Ulfketil, Bishop of Aarhus|Ulfketil]] near the present site to house the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]].  St. Clement was an early Bishop of [[Rome]] who was [[martyr]]ed by having an [[anchor]] tied to his neck and thrown into the [[Black Sea]], according to a fictional biography of the saint.

He lived a [[saint]]ly life and helped the people in the area around Aarhus.  One day, as he and a few men from the town were felling trees to build the church at [[Viby J|Viby]] near the sea, one of the men complained that he was thirsty. St. Niels prayed for water and a spring appeared to slake the man's thirst; St. Niels's Spring has run ever since.  It has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years and many miraculous healings are said to have taken place there, especially on [[Midsummer Day|St. John's Day]]. On his death bed in 1180, St. Niels asked to be buried in \"the little church by the sea\" (St. Clements).

The episcopal chair was moved from Our Lady Church to St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =   http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Peder_Vognsen|title= Peder Vognsen|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral altar back.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] (with paint restored in 1999), windows and the back of the [[altar]] in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nHowever, in 1330, the cathedral and much of the town burned down, and the church was abandoned until 1449. By then the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of architecture had reached Denmark, and the cathedral was enlarged in stages until it reached its present size in year 1500. The [[nave]] was lengthened to 93 meters, the longest in Denmark.  The transept was widened, and the typical [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] raised the ceilings and permitted high windows which fill the building with light.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed life in and around the cathedral in many significant ways. In 1524 [[Hans Tausen]] (1494\u20131561), the Danish [[Martin Luther|Luther]], taught a [[Good Friday]] sermon at Antvarskov Abbey proclaiming the doctrines of Luther.  His superior ordered him imprisoned in the [[Hospitallers]] monastery in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], Jutland.  Tausen taught from his cell and ordinary people responded with enthusiasm.  His superior tried to silence Tausen, but a near riot forced his release.  In the beginning, he was allowed to preach in the open air but his supporters broke open a [[Franciscan]] church, and soon Tausen had more followers than the church could accommodate.  Within a year, he was the king's own [[chaplain]].  Luther's ideas quickly spread to Aarhus and soon the townspeople demanded the right to hear the [[liturgy]] in Danish.  The bishop and [[Canon (priest)|canons]] attempted to stop the spread of the Lutheran doctrine in their [[diocese]], but Tausen had caught the imagination of the people and they would not be cowed by anything the bishop might threaten. Most nobles were staunchly [[Catholic]], and that brought even more support from common people.  By 1528 most of the cities had begun the process of reforming their churches. Tausen taught that tearing apart ancient churches was wrong and that orderly change should be used to reform the church.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Danske_folkekirke/Hans_Tausen|title=  Hans Tausen\n|publisher =  Den Store Danske, Gyldendal |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1533 [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederik I]] died and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: [[Thing (assembly)|''Landsting'']]), but the State Council denominated by the Catholic bishops refused to accept the election and called upon [[count]] [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to assist in restoring Catholic Christian II to the throne. This resulted in a two-year war called the [[Count's Feud]]. Despite the odds, Christian III prevailed and in the summer of 1536 arrested several of the bishops and threw them into prison. The last Roman Catholic Bishop of Aarhus, [[Ove Bille]] (d. 1555) was imprisoned in the summer of 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Ove_Bille|title= Ove Bille|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe tower is the tallest in Denmark at 96 meters. It received its present form in 1931.\nIn 1642 lightning struck the tower and set it ablaze, destroying some of the historic bells, but damage to the interior of the church was minimal.\n\n== Interior ==\n[[Image:Kalkmaleri2.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval fresco in typical Danish style]]\n[[File:Skt. Georg og dragen.jpg|left|thumb|A fresco of St. George with the dragon inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\n===The fresco paintings and the stained glass window===\nAarhus Cathedral has a number of [[Church frescos in Denmark|fresco paintings]] dating from the 1470 to 1520.  Until the Reformation, most of the church's walls were covered in frescoes, of which many were lost. The cathedral still has 220 m<sup>2</sup> of frescoes, more than any other church in Denmark. One pre-1470 painting was saved from the first Romanesque-style cathedral in the northwest corner, the so-called ''Lazarus Window'', painted about 1300. It is believed that the window was used to give food to the [[leper]]s who weren't permitted inside the building.\n\nThe paintings of [[St Christopher]] and St Clement are the tallest in the country. Other figures include [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] and [[St George]] with the dragon (pictured, left).\n\nSt Clements only has one [[Stained glass|stained glass window]].  It was created by  [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] artist [[Emanuel Vigeland]] (1875\u20131948) in 1926. Its theme is taken from [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]]'s [[ hymn]] ''Da livtr\u00e6et f\u00e6stet i graven rod''. It stands 14 m high and is the largest stained glass window in all of Denmark. Three scenes are painted on the window: at the bottom, Christ's lying in his grave on [[Calvary|Golgotha]]; next, Christ crucified, and topmost, Christ standing in golden light. The most unusual feature is the [[Crucifixion]] scene, which (for an unknown reason) shows Jesus's head falling to the left, unlike traditional scenes which always show Jesus's head falling to the right.\n<ref>{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Emanuel_Vigeland|title= Emanuel Vigeland|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=  Nils Messel\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/writers/nikolai-frederik-severin-grundtvig |title= Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig\n|publisher =   Gyldendal Leksikon|author=  Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Altertavle-domkirken.jpg|thumb|left|Altar by [[Bernt Notke]]]]\n\n===The altar===\nThe cathedral has a wonderful altar piece (pictured, left) carved by the famous [[L\u00fcbeck]] sculptor and painter [[Bernt Notke]]) (c. 1440\u2013c. 1509).

It was a gift of Bishop Jens Ivarsen Lange,  (d. 1482) who just two years earlier had given the great altar piece to St Clements.  The font stands on the heads of the [[four evangelists]] in human form, but with the heads of the animals that often symbolize the four [[gospel]]s in ecclesiastic art: [[John the Evangelist|John]] is [[eagle]]-headed, [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] is [[lion]]-headed, [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] bears the head of an [[ox]], while [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] alone has the head of a man.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/dbl/10/0030.html|title= Lange, Jens Iversen, \u20131482, Biskop|publisher =   \tDansk biografisk Lexikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe font has four scenes, carved in relief, from the life of [[Christ]] and nine of the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] (the rest of the figures cannot be identified). The scenes are the [[Baptism#Baptism_of_Jesus|Baptism]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], Christ on [[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]], and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary's]] heavenly coronation.\n\nFor the first hundred years the font was open and the priest dipped the child three times; later there were added a [[brass]] top and a [[silver]] tray used for the baptism of children, which is now over 300 years old.<ref name=DOMKIRKE />\n\n===Golden gates, the bells and the model ship===\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral golden gate.jpg|right|thumb|One of the golden gates inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nThe \"Golden Door\" is one of five wrought [[iron]] gates that separate the nave from the [[choir (architecture)|choir]], a reminder of the separation between the clergy and public in Catholic times.

Frichs bell.\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Domkirke ship.jpg|left|thumb|A model [[ship]] exhibited inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nAs is the custom in many parts of Denmark, a [[ship]] hangs at the crossing as a reminder of those lost at sea and of Denmark's close connection to the sea (pictured, left).  The cathedral's ship (dated 1720) is named ''Enigheden'' (lit. English ''Unity'') and it might have been built in Holland: the [[Russians|Russian]] [[tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] ordered war ships from ship builders in Holland; instead of sketches, he was offered a model of the upcoming ship, which was sent by sea to [[Russia]]. A storm sank the transport by [[Skagen]], and the model made it to shore almost intact. Some fishermen from Aarhus bought the model, and subsequently offered it as a [[votive offering|votive gift]] to the Aarhus Domkirke.\n\nWith the model ship's length of 2.65 m and height of 3.50 m, it is the largest church ship in any Danish church, and it is thought of as a symbol of man's sail from [[Bassinet|cradle]] to [[grave (burial)|grave]].<ref name=DOMKIRKE />\n\n===Tombs and memorials===\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral tomb.jpg|right|thumb|A memorial plaque (dated 1587) above a tomb of a noble woman in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral donation.jpg|right|thumb|A memorial plaque (in [[Danish language|Danish]]) remembering a donation of 100 [[Thaler]]s left to the cathedral in 1702 by an elderly married couple]]\nThe crypt of the cathedral houses the remains of thousands of people of all ranks.\nThe church has several chapels and [[tomb]]s (in both Romanesque and Baroque styles), and a number of [[memorials]]. The most striking is the Marselis Chapel, built for the Marselis family by the Flemish baroque sculptor [[Thomas Quellinus]] (1661-c.1710); the chapel's high Baroque memorial is the largest of its kind in Denmark, and beneath the floor is the family burial vault.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=10096|title= Thomas Quellinus|publisher = kulturarv.dk  \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The organ===\nThe main [[pipe organ]] was built by the organ builder [[Lambert Daniel Kastens]] (c. 1690-1744) in 1730.  He was a student of one of [[Europe]]'s best-known organ makers, [[Arp Schnitger]] (1648\u20131719) of [[Hamburg]].  It has been restored, enlarged, and updated several times, but the [[baroque]] facade has been maintained.
