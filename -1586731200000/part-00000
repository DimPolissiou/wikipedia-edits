The military [[parade]] is now almost entirely ceremonial, though soldiers from time immemorial up until the late 19th century fought in formation. Massed parades may also hold a role for propaganda purposes, being used to exhibit the apparent military strength of one's nation.\n\n==History==\n\nThe terminology comes from the tradition of \n[[close order formation]] combat, in which soldiers were held in very strict formations as to maximise their combat effectiveness. Formation combat was used as an alternative to [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] combat, and required strict discipline in the ranks and competent officers. As long as their formations could be maintained, regular troops could maintain a significant advantage over less organised opponents. Military parades are not to be confused with military show of force.\n\nAlthough the firepower of breechloading rifles and [[machine guns]] long ago rendered close formations in battle suicidal, modern armies still use parades for ceremonial purposes or in non-combat environments for their efficiency, ease of organization and encouragement of discipline. Roughly synonymous are \"drill\" and \"march\". The English word \"drill\" is of [[Middle Dutch]] origin, dating from the 16th-century drill of the Dutch army of prince [[Maurice of Orange]], which was widely copied throughout Europe at the time, decreasing the volley time of musket formations.\n\nIn ancient times, drilling increased in importance when men stopped fighting as individuals and began to fight together as units. Drilling as a vital component of a war machine further increased with the increases in the size of armies, for example when [[Phillip II of Macedon]] disciplined his army so they could swiftly form the [[Phalanx formation|phalanxes]] that were so critical to his successes as a general. Military drilling later was used by the [[Roman Army]] to maximise efficiency and deadliness throughout their long history. After the fall of the empire, and the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] set in Europe, most feudal lords more heavily relied on peasant levies and their wealthy [[knights]] to fight their wars, the knights for the most part reverting to fighting as individuals{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Massed military drilling was used mostly by only the foremost armies and nations, such as the [[Normans]].\n\nThe U.S. drill is based on the contributions of [[Baron von Steuben]], a [[Prussian Army]] officer who served in the [[Continental Army]].<ref>Paul Lockhart, ''The Drillmaster of Valley Forge: The Baron de Steuben and the Making of the American Army'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Books, 2008)</ref> During the winter quarters in [[Valley Forge]], Pennsylvania, von Steuben taught a model company of 100 soldiers musket drill. These soldiers, in turn, taught the remainder of the Continental Army.\n\nThe most familiar form of [[melee weapon]] and [[unarmed combat]] drill in the modern world is the [[Kata]] and the [[Hyung]] in Eastern [[martial arts]]. However, there were once similar drills in the martial training of warriors in all cultures worldwide. They all had exactly the same purpose, to make instinctive an appropriate reaction to an attack or opening by conditioning the mind and body, through repeated and constant repetition of a series of actions (building up [[muscle memory]]). Probably one of the last survivors of such drills in the Western martial tradition are the reaction drills and rhythm exercises in the modern sport of [[fencing]].\n\n[[File:\u0411\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0430 SandCat.JPG|thumb|Parade during [[Defender of the Fatherland Day (Kazakhstan)|Defender of the Fatherland Day]] in [[Nur-Sultan]].]]\n\nThe oldest, largest and most famous regular military parade in [[Europe]] is the [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] which is held each 14 July, on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in [[Paris]], during [[Bastille Day|France's national day]] celebrations.<ref name=\"paris1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.com/paris_city_guide/city_visits_of_paris/champs_elysees_arc_de_triomphe |title=Champs-Elys\u00e9es city visit in Paris, France - Recommended city visit of Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris |publisher=Paris.com |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807091009/http://www.paris.com/paris_city_guide/city_visits_of_paris/champs_elysees_arc_de_triomphe |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}</ref><ref name=\"paris-attractions1\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://paris-attractions.net/celebrate-bastille-day-in-paris-this-year/\n |title=Celebrate Bastille Day in Paris This Year\n |publisher=Paris Attractions |date=2011-05-03\n |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326174027/http://paris-attractions.net/celebrate-bastille-day-in-paris-this-year/\n |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Rationale==\n[[File:Queen's Birthday Parade, Hamilton Bermuda 2000.jpg|thumb|Queen's Birthday Parade, [[Hamilton, Bermuda]], 2000.]]\nA military drill is memorizing certain actions through repetition until the action is instinctive to the soldiers being drilled. Complex actions are broken down into simpler ones which can be practised in isolation so when the whole is put together the desired results are achieved. Such is necessary for a fighting force to perform at maximum efficiency in all manner of situations. However, depending on the army and the drills it adopts, drilling may destroy flexibility and initiative in exchange for predictability and cohesion.\n\nRecruits in most modern militaries are taught drill to teach them how to work and move as a team. In addition, formations are still used in [[riot control]], where m\u00eal\u00e9e combat is still the norm.\n\n==Four directions==\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-5.jpeg|thumb|[[2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]\nParades consist of four directions:\n# Advance\n# Retire\n# Left\n# Right\n\nThe Advance is the primary direction of movement, regardless of which direction the soldiers are actually facing (similar to a ship's [[Bow (ship)|bow]].) On a parade square, the advance is determined by the position of the [[dais]] or flags. When these are not present, the direction of the drill commander is the advance.\n\nThe Retire is opposite to the advance, against the primary direction of movement (similar to a ship's [[stern]].)\n\nThe Left is to the left of the Advance (similar to a ship's [[Port (nautical)|port]].)\n\nThe Right is to the right of the Advance (similar to a ship's [[starboard]].)\n\nIf the Advance is changed, then all other directions are changed to be based on the new Advance.\n\nThere is only one person in charge of a parade at a time. Changing this person is very ceremonious. This is to make it obvious to the soldiers who is currently in command and therefore to whom to pay attention.\n\nDuring parades, unless explicitly told otherwise, soldiers have restricted movement, meaning they can move only exactly when they are told, and then doing only exactly what they are told to do. In most stances, any movement at all is disallowed and is held to such an extent as to have soldiers fainting on parade, although fainting under any conditions short of plural hours standing still in the hot sun is considered a sign of medical disability.<ref name=indianman>{{cite web|last=Srivastava|first=Vikram|title=Drills and Parades|url=http://bprd.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/File965.pdf|work=Police Drill Manual|publisher=Bureau of Police Research and Development, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=21 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206154713/http://bprd.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/File965.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAmerican usage allows the service member to be at four states of alert:\n# [[At attention|Attention]]: standing straight, eyes forward, chest out, knees straight but not locked, feet together at a 45-degree angle.\n# Parade Rest: A modified position of attention in which the left foot is moved to shoulder width (typically measured as exactly 12 inches) and the hands are placed in the small of the back with the right hand placed inside the left with all fingers together and pointing rigidly straight (exception: U.S. Air Force usage is modelled after Commonwealth practice - see below).\n# Stand At Ease: Same as Parade Rest, but the soldier may look at the speaker.\n# At Ease: The service member is allowed to move around all but the right foot, but must remain silent.\n# Rest: Service member may talk, smoke (if command authorized) and may move as long as their right pivot foot remains grounded.\nA formation must be brought to the position of attention before it can go to a higher state of alert.<ref name=\"army\">FM 22-5, Drill and Ceremonies, Headquarters, Department of the Army, 1986</ref><ref name=\"marine\">NAVMC 2691 Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual, Headquarters, United States Marine Corps, 1981</ref>\n\n[[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries allow four states of alert:\n# Attention: standing straight, eyes forward, heels together, feet at a 30-degree angle (540 mils). The hands are held in tight fists with the thumbs aligned with the seam of the trousers.\n# At Ease: a modified position of attention in which the left foot is moved to shoulder width and the hands are placed behind the back with arms fully extended. The right hand is placed inside the left. [[United States|U.S.]] military usage is \"Parade Rest.\"\n# Stand-Easy: Legs remain in the At Ease position, arms are brought to the sides to a more natural standing position. Member may relax their muscles and make minimal movements. U.S. usage is \"At Ease,\" however a common mistake in U.S. military practice confuses \"At Ease\" with \"Rest\" (below).\n# Relax: Legs remain at position at ease, member may make more significant movements or look around. Members may not move the feet. If the troops are not being addressed by a commander, they are generally allowed to talk quietly. U.S. usage is \"Rest.\"\n\n==Common parade commands==\n*'''Fall In'''. Have designated troops move into an already existing formation on the parade square and/or ground.\n*'''Fall Out'''. Have designated troops wheel out and to the right of their formation, then halt facing the parade commander to be dismissed.\n*'''Dis -Miss'''. Telling designated units to leave the parade square and stop drilling. \n*'''[Parade Size]/Parade, [Parade Size], Atten-Tion (Shun)''' (U.S.: '''Atten - Tion (Shun)'''). Have the soldiers uniformly adopt the [[At attention|Attention position]], the most constrictive position (with feet together), but the only position from which soldiers can actually be made to move. In the United States military, the position is defined as heels together, feet at a 45-degree angle, arms straight, palms inward with fingers naturally curled, thumbs along the seams of trousers, shoulders square and head erect, looking forward. In the Royal Navy, the order \"Shun\" is replaced with the order \"Ho\". For Example, the most common usage is \"Guard Ho!\" With a small pause between words.\n\n===Alignment commands===\n\n====Commonwealth version====\n[[Image:Royal Military College of Canada cadets drill in parade square, Stone Frigate 1880s.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets drill in Military parade square, in front of [[HMCS Stone Frigate|Stone Frigate]] 1880s]]\n*'''Right Dress''', - all personnel in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified (Elbow Dressing, Shoulder Dressing).  Some Armies, e.g. the Australian Army, will raise the left arm (the right arm holding the service weapon).\n*'''Left Dress''', - all personnel in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified (Elbow Dressing, Shoulder Dressing).\n*'''Inwards Dress/Centre Dress''', used when a parade is formed up in two or more groups with [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colours, Guidons, or Banners]] on parade.  This is used so that dressing is off the colours.  The formations to the left of the Colour Party will dress to the right and the formations to the right of the Colour Party will dress to the left.   All personnel to the right of the Colours in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. All personnel to the left of the colours in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. Some Armies, i.e. the Australian Army, will raise the left arm (the right arm holding the service weapon).  After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their left or right (depending on the direction of dressing), unless otherwise specified (Elbow Dressing, Shoulder Dressing).\n*'''Eyes Front''', following Right/Left/Inwards Dress, the front rank snaps their arms down and faces forward, while all other ranks simply face forward.\n\n====American version====\n*'''Dress Right, DRESS''' - all personnel in the unit except the soldiers at the far left bring up their left arms parallel to the ground and at the same time snap their heads so they are facing right.  The person on the far right will keep his head straight. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their left.  If the command is preceded by '''\"At Close Interval\"''', the left arm is bent at the elbow rather than parallel to the ground.  If the command is preceded by '''\"At Double Interval\"''', both arms are extended.  '''\"Dress Left\"''' reverses the instructions (Right arm up, look left).\n*'''Ready, FRONT''' - all personnel snap their arms down and faces forward.\n*'''COVER''' - used after any movement is halted to realign the formation.  All personnel in the formation except the squad leaders make short, choppy steps to align themselves with their squad leaders, then come to attention.<ref name = \"army\"/><ref name = \"marine\"/>\n\n===Rest positions===\n[[File:A Member of the Queen's Guards, Guarding the Mall - geograph.org.uk - 1354107.jpg|thumb|190px|A British [[Household Division]] soldier in the position of at ease.]]\n[[File:120416-Z-KZ880-024 (7109575235).jpg|thumb|American honour guards in the ceremonial at ease position.]]\n*'''Stand at Ease''' (U.S.: '''PARADE REST'''). Have the soldiers adopt the more relaxed position At Ease position, with feet shoulder width apart, hands clasped behind back but with upper body half still in position of attention (chest out, shoulders back). This is typically used when soldiers must wait a short duration, ready to adopt the position of attention e.g. if waiting for an Officer to arrive for an inspection. Changing from At Ease to Attention and back again, or the converse, is standard when the command of a parade is transferred (typically between the commanding officer and his Sergeant-Major), since command of a formation is not actually transferred until the new commander makes a command. There is no talking allowed at Parade Rest; personnel must come to the position of attention before speaking.\n*'''Stand at Ease''' (U.S.) This is the same as Parade Rest, except that soldiers are expected to turn their heads to look at whoever is addressing them. This should not be confused with At Ease.\n*'''Stand Easy'''. (U.S.: '''AT EASE''') Have the soldiers adopt the next easiest stance, where hands are still clasped behind the back, however, the soldiers can relax their upper bodies (the shoulders can be slacked) and quietly speak. This is often, but not always, followed by an implicit 'Relax' ('Rest'). This is typically used when being addressed/lectured for a long period of time where the positions of attention or at ease would be too painful/uncomfortable to hold.\n*'''Relax''' (U.S.: '''REST''') The only parade instruction given in an ordinary voice, rather than the raised, emphatic parade voice. This is the only position that actually offers soldiers freedom of movement. Soldiers are typically allowed to move other than moving their feet, though, when it is given by a high-ranking officer, soldiers typically move a minimal amount after a bit of stretching.\n\n===Marching with weapons/saluting===\n'''[[Rifle]]s'''\n*'''Shoulder/Slope Arms''': Although Left and Right Shoulder Arms are both valid commands, left is assumed if it is unstated. Soldiers must be at attention to shoulder weapons. This is typically done through a throw rather than a carry. In British and Commonwealth parades, the command \"Slope Arms\" is used to order soldiers to place their rifles on the top of the shoulder. The command of \"Shoulder Arms\" in the Commonwealth and Britain, is done when a rifle is brought on the left or right sides by the shoulder with the carrying hand holding the pistol grip. In US ceremonies, if the soldiers have the weapons at the order, then it is brought up and carried on the right shoulder, and all shoulder commands must specify the shoulder, and may be performed while [[military step|marching in step]].\n*'''Port Arms''': The weapon is brought out in front of the soldier, and held by the right hand on small of the butt, or equivalent, and the left hand about the forestock, or equivalent. Usually this command is used for preparation of the Feu De Joie/Fire of Joy for parades. In the United States, Port Arms is the required carry position for marching at [[military step|double time]].\n*'''[[Present arms (command)|Present Arms]]''': The soldiers bring their weapons to the front of their bodies, and move adjust their right foot position. Soldiers without weapons use a salute appropriate for their headdress. Often officers can salute on behalf of their troops, and any such ambiguity will be discussed with the troops beforehand. This, in the case of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations, is often used with the precautionary General/Commander's Salute or Royal/Presidential/Prime Minister's Salute, when appropriate. In U.S. usage, all soldiers salute, except if he or she is holding a weapon. Guidons and organizational colors are dipped to 90 degrees above the ground (but not touching the ground, but in the Commonwealth it is common practice). The U.S. national colors are never dipped (it is also the case in Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Spain) but the British or Commonwealth national colors are dipped to the ground when the salute is performed. This command is used whenever saluting during ceremonial inspections in most countries (like Germany, France, Russia, Poland, Italy, Serbia and Ukraine as well as in Chile, Argentina, Ecuador and Colombia), and eyes are pointed to either the left, on the front, or the right to the direction of the honors being paid to. The command for recovery is \"Shoulder/Slope Arms!\" or \"Order Arms!\" depending on the situation.\n*'''Order Arms''': If the soldiers are carrying a weapon which can be ordered they will lower it so that is resting on the ground, touching the outer toes of the right boot, and being supported by a slightly bent right arm. Usually given in Shoulder/Slope Arms or Present Arms position.\n*'''Ground Arms''': The soldier takes a full pace forward, bending their knees, so the right leg is parallel to the floor below the knee, and at the same time leaning forward and laying their rifles down to the ground (ejection port up). They then take the appropriate pause time, then stand up into attention.\n*'''Trail Arms''': Same as Order Arms but with hands holding on the rifle above the ground.\n*'''Sling Arms''': If the soldiers have a \"[[sling (firearms)|sling]]\" (strap) on their rifles, then this command can be called. The soldiers will loosen the sling so they can now have their rifles strapped around their shoulders.\n*'''Unsling Arms''': Servicemen will unloosen the sling so they can now have their rifles at the port or high port position.\n*'''Front Sling Arms''': Servicemen holding weapons with slings attached to the chest now sling those weapons in the Port or High Port Arms position.\n*'''High Port Arms''': This is a higher variant of Port Arms, with both arms holding the weapon high. \n*'''Fire of Joy, load weapons''': This command is used in parades such as the [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade in Singapore]], and [[Trooping the Colour]]. The soldier will load the rifle with the blank round in preparation of the [[Feu de joie]], French for Fire of Joy in parades. This is called in Polish as the ''Salwa Honorowa'' or Honor Volley.\n*'''Fix Bayonets''': In US ceremonies, whenever the bayonets are to be fixed to the weapons, this command is called out. In times, the accompanying bugle call for it is used before the order is done. The troops pull out their bayonets from their uniforms and attach them to the weapon.\n*'''Unfix Bayonets''': Soldiers in formation remove their bayonets from their rifles and return them to their uniforms.\n\n'''[[Sabre]]s'''\n*'''Draw Sabres''': used to draw the sabres.\n*'''Return Sabres''': used to return the sabres.\n*'''Present Sabres''': used for officers to salute using their sabres.\n*'''Shoulder/Slope Sabres''': used for officers to slope the sabre in their left-hand shoulder.\n*'''Order Sabres''': the sabre is lowered to the ground after presenting or sloping.\n\n=== Forming the parade for the march past/pass in review ===\n[[File:Pass and Review.jpg|thumb|Marine Corps General [[Joseph Dunford]], takes part in a pass in review of the [[Ceremonial Guard (Canada)|Ceremonial Guard]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]].]]\n*'''Pass in Review''' - used in the US to denote the start of the march past segment of parades. When this command is said the parade prepares in readiness for the march past. It is also used as a way for a newly assigned commander to inspect the troops he/she commands.<ref>{{cite web | title=Air Force ROTC Detachment 225, Pass in Review | website=University of Notre Dame | date=2019-06-18 | url=https://afrotc.nd.edu/det-225-history/military-functions/pass-in-review/ | access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pass+in+review|title=Pass in Rview|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n* '''Parade, in close order, left/right dress''' - in the UK, this command is used to commence dressing of parade units in close order\n* '''Company, in close order, form three/four ranks''' - in the UK, this command is used to form companies into three or four ranks of personnel each\n* '''Staff behind me, (forward) march''' - in the US, this command is used by the parade commander to form his parade staff in readiness for the march past/pass in review segment of parades\n* '''Parade will now advance/retire in slow/quick time, about turn''' - in the Commonwealth the command is used to form parade formations when arranged in line formation for the march past\n\n===Compliments and Saluting===\n\n====Saluting on the march====\nIn the Commonwealth countries, the following saluting on the march commands are ordered with a preparatory command of ''''Saluting on the march...''''. For example, ''''Saluting on the march, to the front Salute'''' and always called on the left foot.\n*'''To the front Salute''' or '''Salute''': The parade is halted and the right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. This is lowered and then repeated again, followed by an about turn and a resume in marching (off the left foot). The timing is: \"Call, Check, Halt, 2, 3, Up, 2, 3, Down, 2, 3, 4, 5, Up, 2, 3, Down, 2, 3, About, 2, 3, In, 2, 3, Left, Right, Left!\" It is one of, if not the longest drill movement in the military.\nIn British Corps, the drill movement for saluting to the front is the following. Two, three, up. Two, three, down.\n*'''To the Right Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, four, five, down, swing!\"\n:This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n*'''To the Left Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, four, five, down, away!\"\n:This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker (as they are the front most of the saluting flank), who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n\nIn the United States, the command for saluting on the march is \"Eyes, RIGHT/LEFT.\" The parade leader and other officers execute the hand salute, while everyone but the right file or left file in either case turns their heads to the right.\" The command for recovery is \"Ready, FRONT.\" If the command does not have rifles, they will salute if given the command '''present ARMS'''. The arms will be lowered back to their normal position on the commands '''Order ARMS'''. They can also salute if given the command '''Hand SALUTE'''. The salute is raised when the parade leader finishes saying \"salute\", and is lowered in after being held for the same amount of time elapsed between the words \"hand\" and \"salute.\"\n\n=== Compliments on the March ===\n\n*'''Eyes Right''': The parade turn their heads to the right after a check pace. The parade leader salutes while looking in the direction they gave.\n:This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n*'''Eyes Left''': Similar to the '''Eyes Right''' except the parade looks to the left.\n:This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n\n====Saluting at the halt (static)====\n*'''To the front Salute''' or '''Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, down!\"\n*'''To the Right Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, down!\" \n*'''To the Left Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, down!\"\nIn the United States, salutes at a halt are given on the command \"Hand Salute\". They are lowered in the same amount of time elapsed between the two words. The command \"present arms\" will cause the command to salute if the command is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with the command \"order arms\".\n*'''Advance in Review Order''': This is used to pay final compliments to the reviewing officer. On the command: ADVANCE IN REVIEW ORDER, BY THE CENTRE, QUICK...MARCH, the unit being reviewed advances 15 paces and halts automatically before presenting arms to the reviewing officer. It is usually employed by the [[British Army]] and the [[Canadian Army]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.2824cops.com/wp-content/uploads/Army-Cadet-Reference-Manual.pdf|title=Royal Canadian Army Cadets: Cadet Reference Book|publisher=National Defence|year=2001|location=Canada|oclc=289058362|id=A-CR-CCP-121/PT-001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/cgi-bin/forum/archive2006_config.pl?md=read;id=67469|title=Historical Need for Drill|website=www.napoleon-series.org}}</ref>\n\n===Colour commands===\n\n====Marching with colours====\n*'''Let Fly the Colours''': The colours are normally held in a semi-taut position. This is a simple, ceremonial letting fly and catching of the colours.\n*'''Slant Colours''': The colours are normally kept upright, but this can represent a problem both when dealing with standard doors. This slants the colours forward sufficiently to negate this, and they are brought back up afterward.\n*'''Slope/Shoulder Colours''': The normal method for carrying colours can be tiresome for the bearer. This has the colours taken out of their frogs and sloped over the right shoulder at about 45\u00b0.\n\n====Colour commands at the halt (static)====\n*'''Order Colours''': Essentially the same as Order Arms, except used exclusively for the Colour Party.\n*'''Carry Colours''': This is equivalent to Shoulder Arms. The right arm lifts the colours up so they line up with the body's centre line, with the right arm held in front of the soldier, at mouth level parallel to the ground. It is caught and guided into its frog with left hand, which is then returned to its side.\n*'''Change colours''': This is used when the senior flag officer decides that he/she and the other flag holding members, have held their flags for a long time, and that their arms are tired, so, when the command \"Change - colours!\" is given, the flag holders put their arms in line with the flag, their other hand on top of their first hand and move the first hand down to attention, so that the other hand is now at the first hands' original position.\n\n===Turning motions===\n\n===Turning motions at the march===\n*'''Right Turn''' (U.S.:'''Column right, MARCH'''): A 90\u00b0 turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball. The cautionary and executive are both called on the left foot. The left leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground (although exceptions are made for kilted regiments) and slammed into the ground in the position of attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.\n*'''Left Turn''' (U.S.:'''Column left, MARCH'''): A 90\u00b0 turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. The right leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground and slammed down into attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.\n*'''About Turn''' (U.S.: '''To the rear, MARCH'''): A 180\u00b0 turn to the right, done as an exaggerated version of the right turn. United States units do not make exaggerated gestures with the legs or arms.\n*'''Right Flank MARCH''' or '''Right turn''', it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching execute 90\u00b0 turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball.\n*'''Left Flank MARCH''' or '''Left turn''', it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching 90\u00b0 turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.\n*'''Right Incline''' (U.S.:'''Column half-right, MARCH'''), is a half turn to the right, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45\u00b0 to the right, done by rotation on the left ball and the right heel.\n*'''Left Incline''' (U.S.:'''Column half-left, MARCH'''), is a half turn to the left, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45\u00b0 to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.\n*'''Right Wheel''', is a turn to the right, differentiated from a Right Turn in that the order of march remains the same. \n*'''Left Wheel''', is a mirror of the Right Wheel.\n\n====Turning motions at the halt (static)====\n\n'''[[United States Armed Forces]]:'''\n\n*'''Right Face''': The body is rotated on the heel of the right foot and then the left heel is brought forward to meet the right heel in the position of attention.\n*'''Left Face''': A mirror image of Right Face.\n*'''About Face''': The right toe is brought back to behind the left heel; the body pivots on the right toe and left heel 180\u00b0.\n*'''Half-Left Face''': Exactly the same as a left face, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n*'''Half-Right Face''': Exactly the same as a right face, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n\n'''[[Commonwealth of Nations]]'''\n\n*'''Right Turn''': The body is rotated 90\u00b0 to the right members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy, the heel movements mirror that of the US Armed Forces.\n*'''Left Turn''': A mirror image of Right Turn.\n*'''About Turn''': The body is rotated 180\u00b0 in a clockwise direction, knees locked. Members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy heel movements are the same for Right Face.\n*'''Right Incline''': Exactly the same as a right turn, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n*'''Left Incline''': Exactly the same as a left turn, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n\n===Marching motions===\n{{main|Military step}}\n*'''Quick March''': The standard pace is typically 116 beats/minute with a 30in. step.  There is also a '''Rifleman's Pace''', 140 beats/minute and a '''Highland Pace''', 110 beats/minute (typically done with a kilt.) The pace is based on the individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band's rhythm. The way the march is performed depends on the regiment's nationality.\n*'''Slow March''': This is a ceremonial pace, used for funerals and when a unit's colours are marched out in front of the troops. The standard pace is 65 beats per minute.\n*'''Half Step March''' or '''Cut the pace''':\n:*This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as Quick Time, but instead of 30 inches, the step is 15 inches.\n:*There is also a Canadian and Commonwealth version of this, used for when the front file/rank is getting too far ahead of the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, it means that front file/rank should make their steps smaller, to allow for the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, to get back into proper dressing.\n*'''Double March''': This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of Quick Time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is '''\"Double Time, MARCH.\"'''\n*'''Easy March''': This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is '''\"Route Step, MARCH.\"''' In the Canadian Forces the command '''\"March at, EASE\"''' is given while the unit is on the march. It can not be given from the halt.\n*'''[[Military mark time|Mark Time]]''': This is essentially a [[Military mark time|stationary march]] with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off of the ground. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed. The U.S. equivalent command is \"'''Mark Time, MARCH'''.\"\n*'''Step For -Ward''' or '''Forward''' or '''Forward, March''': This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march.\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:2013. \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0435 181.jpg|thumb|Cadets parade in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]].]]\n\nDrill is today used to demonstrate discipline and cohesion in a modern military force. Large military parades are today held on major holidays and military events around the world. It usually held on occasions of national importance such as a country's independence day, and therefore is presided over by the head of state who, in most cases, is the commander in chief of the combined national military forces of that country. Today, military parades include all aspects of military drill, from an [[exhibition drill]] of precision drill teams and [[military band]]s (in addition to the occasional [[corps of drums]], [[fanfare band]], and/or [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]]), as well as an exhibition of military weapons such as a mobile column, the occasional mounted cavalry column (led by a [[mounted band]]), a naval parade, and a fly past by the country's [[air force]]. When on parade, most of the participating soldiers wear their [[Full dress uniform|ceremonial uniforms]] and carry the standards/colours of their respective battalions/regiments/corps/academies. In many countries, the military contingent is joined by contingents from youth cadet organizations, personnel from the police and fire services and by occasion jail and border services, youth police and fire cadets, veterans and personnel of the civil service.\n\n===By country ===\n==== Albania ====\n[[Albania]] has long been influenced by Greek and Italian influences and even Soviet/Russian tradition. During the era of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Liberation Day (Albania)|Liberation Day]], which then the main national holiday, was celebrated with a military parade of the [[Albanian People's Army]] on [[Tirana]]'s [[D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard]]. These parades have been held in 1954,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Current Digest of the Soviet Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvMRAAAAIAAJ|volume=Vol 6|year=1954|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.}}</ref> 1959,<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service|title=Daily Report: Foreign Radio Broadcasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wi0jAQAAMAAJ|year=1959}}</ref> 1964, 1974,<ref>{{cite book|title=Daily Report: People's Republic of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5sbAQAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=U.S. Foreign Broadcast Information Service}}</ref> 1984<ref>{{cite book|title=Soviet Analyst|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrVpAAAAMAAJ|volume=13-14|year=1984}}</ref> and 1989.

One of the more notable modern military parades was held on the [[100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania]], in which a special unit of 65 soldiers from the [[Kosovo Security Force]] as well as other foreign contingents participated. The other took place on 4 December 2007 in honor of the 95th anniversary of the [[Albanian Armed Forces]].<ref>https://aaf.mil.al/index.php/arkivi/dhjetor-2007/1403-parade-ushtarake-madheshtore-me-rastin-e-95-vjetorit-te-krijimit-te-forcave-te-armatosura-shqiptare</ref>\n\n==== Argentina ====\nArgentina's long history of military parades are a heritage inherited from the times of the Spanish colonial Viceroyality of Rio de la Plata, with influences from Germany, France, Britain and Italy. Today the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], together with the paramilitary [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] and [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]] hosts massive military parades featuring armed companies, cadets, and military bands on the following days (national events unless otherwise noted):\n\n* January 24 - anniversary of the beginning of the Crossing of the Andes (local commemoration)\n* February 3 - anniversary of the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] (local commemoration)\n* April 2 - [[Malvinas Day|Falklands War Veterans' Day]]\n* May 10 - anniversary of Air Force baptism of fire in the [[Falklands War]]\n* May 17 - Navy Day, anniversary of the victory at the [[Battle of Buceo]]\n* May 25 - [[First National Government|First National Government Anniversary Day]]\n* May 29 - Army Day\n* June 17 -  General Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes Memorial Day (local commemoration)\n* June 20 - [[Flag Day (Argentina)|Flag Day]]\n* June 30 - Naval Prefecture Day\n* July 9 - [[Argentine Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n* July 28 - National Gendarmerie Day\n* August 10 - Air Force Day\n* September 24 - Battle of Tucuman Day (local commemoration)\n* November 20 - [[National Sovereignty Day]]\n\n==== Australia and New Zealand ====\nAs both Commonwealth realms, Australia and New Zealand share the customs and traditions of parades of the British Armed Forces. The friendship and cooperation of the defence services of both countries can be seen in the annual [[Anzac Day]] parades every 25 April, in memory of the namesake [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], which was heavily involved in the long [[Battle of Gallipoli]] and were the first Allied forces to land there on that day in 1915. On this day, in many major cities in these two countries, parades are held involving personnel of both the [[Australian Defence Force]] and the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], veterans' organizations, cadet organizations and other youth uniformed groups and personnel of the police and fire services, as well as students of schools and universities honoring many of their fallen alumni of the long campaign.\n\nParades are also held jointly in these two countries on 11 November, Remembrance Day.\n\nAside from these two days, the schedule of annual military and civil parades held in these two countries is as follows:\n\n* For parades in Australia:\n** National level parades are held on:\n*** 26 January, Australia Day\n*** The second  Monday of June, the Queen's Birthday, marked in most of Eastern Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory\n**** typically the last Monday of September or the first Monday of October, Queen's Birthday Holiday for Western Australia\n**** 1st Monday in October, Queen's Birthday Holiday for Queensland\n** Local parades involving armed forces, police and fire personnel are held on:\n*** 2nd Monday in March in the ACT, Canberra Day\n*** 6 June in Queensland, Queensland Day\n*** first Monday in June in Western Australia, Western Australia Day\n*** first working day after Christmas Day, Proclamation Day in South Australia\n** Parades are also held in the following cases:\n*** during change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet [[Passing out (military)|passing out parades]] and regimental anniversaries within the service branches of the ADF and all military academies\n*** During holiday parades held in major cities as can be permitted by the commander of the unit taking part, including:\n**** the AFL Grand Final Parade in Melbourne\n* For parades in New Zealand:\n** National level parades are held on:\n*** 6 February, Waitangi Day\n*** on the 1st Monday in June, the Queen's Birthday\n** Local parades involving armed forces, police and fire personnel are held within the anniversary days of the former [[Provinces of New Zealand]], which were abolished in 1876, the days of which are as set by their respective district and city governments.\n** Change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet graduation parades, together with regimental anniversary parades, are also held occasionally within the service branches of the NZDF and its training institutions.\n\n==== Canada ====\nWithin Canada, the now tri-service [[Ceremonial Guard]] performs the marchpast for senior dignitaries of the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] during change of command ceremonies and state arrival ceremonies, typically held in [[Ottawa]], the national capital. The two [[Primary Reserve]] [[Canadian Army]] regiments that typically provide personnel for the guard, the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] and [[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]], together with the [[Governor General's Horse Guards]] and guard of honour detachments from both the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] take part in these events. In addition, the CG and optionally both the GGHG and the CGG take part in military parades such as the more common [[Trooping the Colour]], also in Ottawa and special parades during the jubilee years of the monarch or of national foundation. The CAF personnel, as well as the [[Canadian Cadet Organizations]] and military veterans also parade during national holidays such as [[Remembrance Day]], [[Victoria Day]], [[Canada Day]] or [[Canadian Forces Day]], as well as during parades celebrating anniversaries of regiments, brigade groups or wings, and divisional level formations and passing out parades of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] and recruit training bases, as well as in local holidays in the provinces and major cities. Across the country, the annual Warriors Day military parade has since 1921, been a traditional event of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. It is specifically devoted to formally recognizing veterans of the CF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewarriorsdayparade.ca/Parade%20History-Guide.html|title=The Warriors' Day Parade - History Guide}}</ref> Like in the UK, the [[Authorized marches of the Canadian Armed Forces|regimental march of the unit]] being honored is played by the band and/or [[pipe band]] if present.\n\n==== Chile ====\nThe tradition of military parades in Chile has origins not just in Spanish tradition, but also a mix between those of France, the United Kingdom, and particularly Germany, given the fact that Imperial German Army officers trained the army and navy in the mid-1890s in the Prussian-German traditions of military parades that are continued until today.\n\nCurrently, the [[Chilean Armed Forces]] and the [[Carabineros de Chile]] hold public parades in front of state leaders and the public on\n\n* 21 May - [[Navy Day (Chile)|Navy Day]] - honoring the fallen of the 1879 [[Battle of Iquique]], also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the [[Chilean Navy]]\n* 19 September - [[Great Military Parade of Chile|Army Day]] - while honoring the 1810 anniversary of the formal inauguration of the First Government Junta, is also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the [[Chilean Army]]\n\nLocal level parades are marked on the following days aside from 21 May:\n\n* 17 February  - anniversary of the victory in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]]\n* 21 March - Air Force Day\n* 2 April - anniversary of the victory in the [[Battle of Maipu]]\n* 27 April - Carabineros Day\n* 7 June - anniversary of the victory in the [[Battle of Arica]]\n* 9 July  - Flag Day\n* 20 August - birthday of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]]\n* 18 September - Independence Day\n* 2 October - anniversary of the [[Battle of Rancagua]]\n* 30 November - [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] Day\n\n==== China ====\nThe first military parade on the Chinese mainland can be dated to over 4,000 years ago, when [[Yu the Great]], a legendary ruler in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], hosted a gathering of tribal forces from northern and southern China.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=llmCOvtWcUcC&pg=PA76&dq=chinese+military+parade+1984&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4wKiB1IXlAhUQIKwKHfsJBp8Q6AEISTAF#v=onepage&q=chinese%20military%20parade%201984&f=false</ref>\n\n===== People's Republic of China =====\n{{See also|Military parades in Hong Kong}}\n{{external media|align=right|width=250px|video1=Parts [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmnAg_e9Dk 1] [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy_Kyq5iCzE 2] [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy_Kyq5iCzE 3] and [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4WJNtiHiZJQ 4] of a documentary on the history of Chinese military parades|align2=right|width2=250px|video2=[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ZfByEEYmg 1981 \u65b0\u7586 \u5927\u9605\u5175 Chinese Uighur Military Parade in Xinjiang (Eng narration)]}}\nThe People's Republic of China holds extraordinary military parades in Beijing to celebrate [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]]. The first parade of this nature took place right after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China]] by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] on 1 October 1949. Originally celebrated annually, the parade was suspended in 1960, before returning in 1984 to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. It is now held to mark every tenth anniversary, starting in 1999. Parades were also held in 1964, 1966, 1969 and 1970.<ref>https://www.frstrategie.org/en/publications/strategic-imagery/military-parade-70th-anniversary-prc-revealing-example-chinese-strategic-power-2019</ref>\n\nIn 2015, China held a [[2015 China Victory Day Parade|military parade]] to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the [[Victory over Japan Day|Victory over Japan]]. This was the first time China held a military parade for an event other than its National Day. It is currently unknown if China will continue to celebrate the end of World War II, through.\n\nIn 2017, the 90th anniversary since the [[Nanchang Uprising]] and the beginning of the [[People's Liberation Army]] was marked by a [[2017 PLA Day Parade|military parade]], the first time ever that a military parade had been held in its honor and the first time it was held outside of the capital, having been held at [[Zhurihe Training Base]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] under the direction of General [[Han Weiguo]] of the [[Central Theater Command]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-defence/chinas-xi-calls-for-building-elite-forces-during-massive-military-parade-idUSKBN1AF00J|title=China's Xi calls for building elite forces during massive military parade|first=Michael|last=Martina|first2=Ben|last2=Blanchard|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 29, 2017|editor-first=Kim|editor-last=Coghill|editor-first2=Sam|editor-last2=Holmes}}</ref><ref>https://www.chinadailyhk.com/articles/50/38/44/1501474883058.html</ref> This was also the first field parade to take place since September 1981 when a parade consisting of troops participating in an excersise in [[Zhangjiakou]] in the presence of [[Deng Xiaoping]] to commemorate Deng's assumption to the post of [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]. During that parade, Deng reportedly said \"Let\u2019s hold a large-scale one if we are to hold a military exercise, so that it can be of use\" in reference to the size of the parade.<ref>https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2079193/massive-parade-tipped-plas-90th-birthday</ref> Naval parades have also been reintroduced in recent years with a [[2018 South China Sea Parade|parade]] (which was the biggest naval review since 1949 and according to the Chinese government, the biggest in 600 years.<ref>https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/superpower-china-claims-biggest-naval-parade-600-years-25403</ref>) being held in the [[South China Sea]] in 2018 and a [[PLA Navy Platinum Jubilee Parade|parade]] for the [[platinum jubilee]] of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] being held in early 2019.\n\nSmaller scale parades are also periodically held in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]].

This practice was abandoned in 1991 though parades were recently held every five years beginning in 2011 during the [[100th Anniversary of the Republic of China|Xinhai Revolution centenary]] and again in 2016. Special parades were held outside Taipei in 1995 and 2015 marking the 50th and 70th anniversaries, respectively, of both the Allied victory in the Second World War and the conclusion of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\n==== Colombia ====\nBoth the [[Military Forces of Colombia]] and the [[National Police of Colombia]] hold important national parades to celebrate the anniversary of national independence as well as of the Armed Forces. Such parades are a mix of the Spanish, German, French, American and British influences owing to the long history of the country's military and police forces. National level parades are held on:\n\n* February 15 - Air Force Day \n* July 20 - [[Colombian Independence Day parade|Independence Day]]\n* July 24 - Navy Day \n* August 7 - Army Day and [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1|Battle of Boyaca Victory Day]]\n* November 15 - National Police Day\n\nLocal level parades by the personnel and veterans of the armed forces and police are held on the following:\n\n* April 7 - Barranquilla Day\n* July 3 - Cali Independence Day\n* November 11 - Cartagena Independence Day\n\n==== Cuba ====\nThe [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] generally holds military parades in honor of the [[Day of the Cuban Armed Forces]] and the [[Triumph of the Revolution]] on [[Havana]]'s [[Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n]]. The first parade took place in 1960 for the latter event and over time, importance was transferred to Armed Forces Day in relation to military parades. In 2011, a special honor parade was held on April 16 to commemorate the [[golden jubilee]] since the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref>https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-04-16/cuba-marks-victory-socialism</ref> The largest parade to be held took place in December 1986 in honor of the 30th anniversary of the revolution, in which General [[Humberto Ortega]] from [[Nicaragua]] as well as officials from the [[Soviet Union]] attended.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=7z1mvx29XMgC&pg=PA589&dq=military+parade+in+cuba+1986&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8so7g9oHmAhUP2qwKHZwTBuUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=military%20parade%20in%20cuba%201986&f=false</ref> The [[diamond jubilee]] parade planned for 2016 was postponed for 1 month due to the [[death and state funeral of Fidel Castro]], and took place during the Victory Day celebrations on 2 January 2017.<ref>http://www.cubagob.cu/otras_info/minfar/granma.htm</ref><ref>http://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?o=rn&id=135863&SEO=conmemoran-en-angola-dia-de-las-fuerzas-armadas-de-cuba</ref>\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n[[File:Vojenska prehlidka 1985b.jpg|thumb|A parade of tanks of the \u010cSLA in Prague on [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]], 9 May 1985.]]\n{{external media|align=right|width=250px|video1=[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EApCYZR-NMk Czechoslovak Military Parade \"Shield-84\" - Vojensk\u00e1 p\u0159ehl\u00eddka \u010cSLA \"\u0160t\u00edt-84]}}\nLarge mlitary parades in the [[Czech Republic]] are today held every 10 years in the capital of [[Prague]], encompassing personnel from the [[Czech Army]] and the [[Police of the Czech Republic]].

Regular military parades were held during the period of the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], with the first parades being organized in the 1950s. The first parade of the [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] (\u010cSLA) took place in 1951 in [[Letn\u00e1]]. Since then, parades were held every five years on 9 May to mark the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Prague uprising|Liberation of Czechoslovakia]]. To honor the latter's celebrations, the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] would be performed by the massed bands on parade preceded by the [[Kde domov m\u016fj|Czechoslovakian national anthem]].

It is currently the oldest and largest military parade on the European continent. It is held on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and passes from l'[[Arc de Triomphe]] to [[Place de la Concorde]]. Bastille Day parades are also held in smaller garrison towns such as [[Toulon]] and [[Belfort]]. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the [[French Republican Guard]] regularly performs ceremonial marchpasts in is role as the [[guard of honour]] for the [[President of the French Republic]]. Like the British, many French units have the ability to march in quick time, while only one - the [[French Foreign Legion]] - marches uniquely in slow time, while another unit of the armed forces marches in very quick time and that is of the Army's [[Chasseurs]], especially its [[Chasseurs alpins]].\n\nLocal parades are held on the following days:\n\n* May 8 - [[Victory in Europe Day]]\n* November 11 - Armistice Day\n* Anniversaries of important battles fought by the French Armed Forces\n\n==== Germany ====\nThe [[Germany]] has had a long tradition of military parades dating back to the days of [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and its army and navy. It was the Prussians who invented the [[goose step]], a style of marching that was used in many German armies as well as in the militaries of various countries, which were instructed by Prussian military training officers and instructors from the 19th century to the early 20th.\n\nDuring the [[Nazi era]], military parades were commonplace as they were held as a sort of victory parade for the German [[Wehrmacht]] as they invaded countries during the Second World War. The first major parades took place in [[Nuremberg]] in September 1938 and [[Adolf Hitler's 50th birthday]] in April 1939. In the months Immediately after the [[German invasion of Poland]], a [[German\u2013Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk|joint German\u2013Soviet military parade]] took place in [[Brest-Litovsk]] (now [[Brest, Belarus]]). In [[Allied-occupied Germany]], the major powers held parades through the center of Berlin to honor their victory. These include the [[Berlin Victory Parade of 1945]], [[1945 British Berlin Victory Parade]] and [[Berlin Victory Parade of 1946]].\n\nIn the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), parades were held according to the Russian standard, although the [[Soviet Army]] allowed the East Germans to use the Prussian tradition, something that had been dropped by their West German counterparts in the 50s. In the GDR, parades were held on the following occasions:\n\n*NVA Day (3 March)\n*[[International Workers' Day]] (1 May)\n*[[Liberation Day|Tag der Befreiung]] (8 May)\n*[[Republic Day (East Germany)|Tag der Republik]] (7 October)\n\nThe first parade took place on 1 May 1956 in the presence of [[President of East Germany|President]] [[Wilhelm Pieck]].<ref>https://www.mdr.de/zeitreise/erster-mai-ddr-politparade-volksfest100.html</ref> In the 60s and early 70s, parades took place on the western half of the [[Palace of the Republic, Berlin|Palace of the Republic]], which was intended as a military parade ground, even though tremors from the heavy vehicles proved dangerous due to the glass facade. By 1979, the western half was used mainly as a parking lot and military parades were moved to [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] in central Berlin.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F029232-0004, N\u00fcrburgring, Bundeswehrparade zum NATO-Jubil\u00e4um.jpg|thumb|[[Bundeswehr]] personnel on the [[N\u00fcrburgring]].]]\nIn 1969, the first military parade of [[West Germany]] and later the entire [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was held on the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] in the town of [[N\u00fcrburg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].<ref>http://www.hawkies.de/chronik-39.html</ref> It took place on 6 June 1969 and was held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).<ref>https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/GJQUEWUHL6MHFEI7OOLMIOGW4VZT7UTU</ref> It was attended by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] in his position as [[Federal Chancellor of Germany]]. Participating foreign and national units included those from the [[Bundeswehr]], [[Canadian Forces Europe]], [[United States Army Europe]], as well as army contingents from [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Allied parades were also held later in the country's 40-year existence.\n\nToday, military parades are held on the following holidays on a smaller scale:\n\n* Remembrance Day of [[July 20 plot|July 20]]\n* [[German Unity Day]] (October 3)\n* Passing out parades of NCO training schools and officer training institutions\n\n==== Greece ====\nThe long history of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]] and the role played in the defense and progress of the country are recalled in splendid and grand military parades that are held in major cities in the country following a hybrid of the British, French, Danish and German traditions on the following dates:\n\n* 25 March - [[Greek Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n* 28 October - Ohi Day\n* On Liberation Days of major cities and towns, honoring the Greek fallen of the Second World War and the later Greek Civil War\n\n==== India ====\nThe [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]] is held annually in [[Delhi]] to mark the Republic Day of [[India]]. Parades are also held on the service holidays: [[Army Day (India)|Army Day]], Navy Day and Air Force Day.\n\n==== Mongolia ====\nMilitary parades in [[Mongolia]] have a long tradition that dates back to the era of the [[Mongol Empire]].

Air force of Poland.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Air Force]] ceremonial guard during the Armed Forces Day parade.]]\nThe [[Polish Armed Forces]] and the [[Police of Poland]] holds two yearly military parades ({{lang-pl|Defilada wojskowa}}) in the capital of [[Warsaw]]: The [[Armed Forces Day (Poland)|Armed Forces Day]] parade through [[Ujazd\u00f3w Avenue]] and the [[National Independence Day (Poland)|National Independence Day]] parade near the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] on [[Pi\u0142sudski Square]]. Both of these parades include [[NATO]] personnel stationed near or inside the country. The Armed Forces Day Parade was introduced in 2007 and 2008 as first grand military parades since the holiday was reinstated and have been held yearly since 2013. The first Polish military parade took place on 17 January 1945. Prior to 1989, parades were held in front of the [[Palace of Culture and Science]] on [[Parade Square]] on 22 July commemorate the [[National Day of the Rebirth of Poland]] celebrations, honoring the anniversary of the signing of the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-sponsored [[PKWN Manifesto]]. Back then, the [[People's Republic of Poland]] used many Russian traditions in regards to military parades, especially the inspection by the Minister of Defence. In 1966, during the millennium celebrations of the [[Christianization of Poland]], a parade was held on 22 July which included cadets of military academies and personnel of Polish ceremonial units dressed in historical military uniforms dating back to the [[Piast dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Polish Chronicle | website=KronikaRP | url=http://www.kronikarp.pl/pop-up.php?id=58989&type=2 | language=pl | access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://phistory.info/photo-history/679-rycari-v-kinorekvizite-uchastvuyut-v-parade-v-chest-1000-letiya-polskogo-gosudarstva.html|title=Knights (in Film Props) Participate in a Parade in Honor of the 1000th Anniversary of the Polish State|date=2019-07-14|website=phistory.info|language=ru|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref> A [[1985 Warsaw Victory Day Parade|special parade]] was held on 9 May 1985 to honor the 40th anniversary of the Victory in Europe and the servicemen of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the East. In 2019, a 3rd was added when the yearly [[3 May Constitution Day]] parades, last held in 1939 and were held off and on since 1990, were officially reinstated.\n\n==== Russia and ex-Soviet countries ====\n[[File:Naval Academy 1983.jpg|thumb|The [[N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy]], led by Captain Anatoliy Karpenko, during a parade on [[Leningrad]]'s [[Palace Square]] in 1983.]]\nThe Western tradition of military parades in the [[Russian Empire]] was part of the many reforms made by [[Peter the Great]] as part of his many efforts to transform the army and the navy from traditional militias to a full-blown professional armed service that is a model for the people in discipline and obedience, courage, bravery, loyalty to the country and in bringing pride and glory to her people. During the Imperial period, national parades were alternated between [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] on major national civil and military holidays, anniversaries of the Romanov Dynasty and as part of the imperial coronation celebrations, celebrations and parades were also held in many major cities and provincial capitals.\n\nSo important was the value of these parades that even the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] made these parades a common tradition beginning in August 1918 when the first modern parade was held in Moscow's [[Red Square]] when Moscow area [[Vsevobuch]] detachments march past, earlier that May, a [[1918 May 1 Parade|military parade]], the first by the nascent [[Red Army]], was held outside the capital. Since that year, many innovations have been seen in the practice of annual parades held not just there but in the capital cities of the former [[Soviet Union]], as well as in major cities in the wide country, which were held on 1 May (1918-1941 and 1945-1968), [[October Revolution Day|7 November]] (1920-1941 and 1945-1990) and [[Victory Day Parades|9 May]] (1945, 1965, 1985 and 1990). Today, the [[Russian Armed Forces]] - and by extension countries of the former Soviet Union - host a variety of military parades held on important national holidays, honoring the men and women of their armed forces and military veterans. The celebrations in each of these countries carry on years of tradition, honor, discipline and prestige by the millions of men and women who serve and have served in the ranks of the armed forces of their respective home countries. These parades have extensive government funding and aside from the iconic wide march past columns and occasional historical formations, typically include a mobile column, and occasionally a naval fleet review and/or air force fly past segment, a legacy of the Soviet era.\n\n[[File:4Samarin.jpg|thumb|A Russian Armed Forces Honour Parade on [[Red Square]] in November 2018.]]\n\n===== Armenia =====\nWhile the country was a Soviet Republic from 1920 to 1991, Armenia was formerly independent from 1918 to 1920 and thus had armed forces composed of both veterans of the Imperial Army and guerillas fighting the Ottoman armed forces who had been enforcing the anti-Armenian massacres of 1914. Armenians fought bravery in the Eastern Front of the Second World War as part of the Soviet Armed Forces, retaining some of its traditions today. The last of the Soviet era parades took place in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.am/hy/news/2015/07/10/%D4%B1%D6%80%D5%B1%D5%A1%D5%B6/19710|title=Talking Monuments.

The forces on parade are assembled based on a mix of the Turkish and Russian parade formation.\n\n===== Belarus =====\nThe [[Armed Forces of Belarus]] holds an annual military parade on 3 July along the [[Victors Avenue]] in the national capital [[Minsk]], marking the anniversary of the liberation of the country during the 1944 [[Minsk Offensive]], which coincides with the country's [[Independence Day (Belarus)|Independence Day]]. On special years of the victory in Europe, commemorative extraordinary parades are held there on 9 May to honor the millions of Belarusian military dead of the [[Second World War]]. Military parades in the country are based on the Russian/Polish model and tradition. Formerly, parades in the [[Republic of Belarus]] and the [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]] took place on [[Independence Square, Minsk|Independence Square]] (known in the Soviet era as Lenin Square). This changed in the early 2000s when the square was renovated and became incompatible with the parade format. Military parades in the BSSR also took place on [[October Square, Minsk|October Square]] from 1946 to 1984. Since 2004, military parades in the capital have taken place on [[Victors Avenue]]. In connection with the centennial of the Belarusian Armed Forces in 2018, a military parade was held in the Western city of [[Grodno]].\n\n===== Estonia =====\nWhile being formerly independent from 1918 to 1940 and as a component republic of the Soviet Union from that year to 1941 and yet again from 1944 to 1991, the current [[Estonian Defence Forces]] and the [[Estonian Defence League]], successor to both the military and reserve forces of the First Republic and republican formations under the Baltic Military District and Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Armed Forces, marches during a combination of Russian, Finnish and Western drill in parades held in the following days:\n\n* February 24 - [[Independence Day (Estonia)|Independence Day]]\n* June 24 - [[V\u00f5idup\u00fcha|Victory Day]]\n\nDuring the 2006 Victory Day Parade in [[Saaremaa]], the first ever Fleet Review of the [[Estonian Navy]] in Estonian history was conducted by the [[Estonian Defence League]].\n\n===== Georgia ===== \nThe [[Defense Forces of Georgia]], successor to the armed services of the Democratic Republic and Soviet formations stationed in the Georgian SSR, hosts military parades on May 26, [[Independence Day (Georgia)|Independence Day]], the anniversary of the formation of the republic in 1918, together with elements from:\n\n* [[National Police of Georgia]]\n* [[Border Police of Georgia]]\n* [[Georgian Coast Guard]]\n\nModern parades are a mix of the former Soviet and modern Western (British, US, Turkish and Israeli) traditions and drill owing to the modernization of the defense and public security forces to NATO and EU standards.\n\n===== Kazakhstan =====\nThe [[Armed Forces of Kazakhstan]] holds military parades ({{Lang-kk|\u04d8\u0441\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434}}) that resemble the parades of the Russian military in [[Moscow]], with one of the only exceptions being the inspection of the troops by the [[President of Kazakhstan|Supreme Commander of the Kazakh Armed Forces]], instead of the defense minister. It has never held yearly parades celebrating one occasion, with parades currently being held in honor of the [[Defender of the Fatherland Day (Kazakhstan)|Defender of the Fatherland Day]] holiday. In the past, large scale military parades in the former capital of [[Almaty]] and the current capital of [[Nur-Sultan]] were held on the following holidays:\n\n*[[Kazakhstan Independence Day]] (1996)\n*[[Victory Day (9 May)]] (1995, 2015)\n*[[Constitution Day (Kazakhstan)]] (2009, 2010, 2011)\n\nIn recent years, the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade was expanded to function as a so-called \"Battle Parade\" (\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434).

These parades usually are held at the 40th [[Otar Military Base]] in the [[Korday District]] and take place with the troops in full combat gear rather than a ceremonial [[full dress uniform]]. Like former Soviet republics, Kazakh military parades are led by a cadet [[Corps of drums|drum corps]], specifically from the [[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]].\n\n===== Kyrgyzstan =====\nKyrgyz military parades are based on Russian traditions, having been held on many different occasions in the history of the [[Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan]]. Currently, the only consistent military parade is held on [[Ala-Too Square]] in [[Bishkek]] every 5 years in honor of the country's [[Independence Day (Kyrgyzstan)|Independence Day]].

Since 2014, military bands have also played an integral part in these parades by marching with their units as part of the parade.

These are not considered to be regular military parades however, as the parading formations are actually not entirely composed of armed servicemen. The first known organized military procession in the [[United States]] was the [[Grand Review of the Armies]], on May 23 and May 24, 1865, following the end of the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865). The [[New York City Victory Parade of 1946]] was held in mid-January in 1946 to commemorate the conclusion of [[World War II]] and the Allied victory over the Axis Powers in all theaters of the war, helped by the service of millions of Americans who served under the armed forces and the National Guard, in addition to the state defense forces. In the late 40s and the early 50s, massive parades in honor of Army Day and later Armed Forces Day were held in the capital.<ref>https://networks.h-net.org/node/28441/discussions/1341907/washington-loves-parade</ref> The most recently held military parade was the [[National Victory Celebration]] on June 8, 1991, to celebrate the conclusion of [[Gulf War]] in [[Iraq]].

The military [[parade]] is now almost entirely ceremonial, though soldiers from time immemorial up until the late 19th century fought in formation. Massed parades may also hold a role for propaganda purposes, being used to exhibit the apparent military strength of one's nation.\n\n==History==\n\nThe terminology comes from the tradition of \n[[close order formation]] combat, in which soldiers were held in very strict formations as to maximise their combat effectiveness. Formation combat was used as an alternative to [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] combat, and required strict discipline in the ranks and competent officers. As long as their formations could be maintained, regular troops could maintain a significant advantage over less organised opponents. Military parades are not to be confused with military show of force.\n\nAlthough the firepower of breechloading rifles and [[machine guns]] long ago rendered close formations in battle suicidal, modern armies still use parades for ceremonial purposes or in non-combat environments for their efficiency, ease of organization and encouragement of discipline. Roughly synonymous are \"drill\" and \"march\". The English word \"drill\" is of [[Middle Dutch]] origin, dating from the 16th-century drill of the Dutch army of prince [[Maurice of Orange]], which was widely copied throughout Europe at the time, decreasing the volley time of musket formations.\n\nIn ancient times, drilling increased in importance when men stopped fighting as individuals and began to fight together as units. Drilling as a vital component of a war machine further increased with the increases in the size of armies, for example when [[Phillip II of Macedon]] disciplined his army so they could swiftly form the [[Phalanx formation|phalanxes]] that were so critical to his successes as a general. Military drilling later was used by the [[Roman Army]] to maximise efficiency and deadliness throughout their long history. After the fall of the empire, and the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] set in Europe, most feudal lords more heavily relied on peasant levies and their wealthy [[knights]] to fight their wars, the knights for the most part reverting to fighting as individuals{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Massed military drilling was used mostly by only the foremost armies and nations, such as the [[Normans]].\n\nThe U.S. drill is based on the contributions of [[Baron von Steuben]], a [[Prussian Army]] officer who served in the [[Continental Army]].<ref>Paul Lockhart, ''The Drillmaster of Valley Forge: The Baron de Steuben and the Making of the American Army'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Books, 2008)</ref> During the winter quarters in [[Valley Forge]], Pennsylvania, von Steuben taught a model company of 100 soldiers musket drill. These soldiers, in turn, taught the remainder of the Continental Army.\n\nThe most familiar form of [[melee weapon]] and [[unarmed combat]] drill in the modern world is the [[Kata]] and the [[Hyung]] in Eastern [[martial arts]]. However, there were once similar drills in the martial training of warriors in all cultures worldwide. They all had exactly the same purpose, to make instinctive an appropriate reaction to an attack or opening by conditioning the mind and body, through repeated and constant repetition of a series of actions (building up [[muscle memory]]). Probably one of the last survivors of such drills in the Western martial tradition are the reaction drills and rhythm exercises in the modern sport of [[fencing]].\n\n[[File:\u0411\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0430 SandCat.JPG|thumb|Parade during [[Defender of the Fatherland Day (Kazakhstan)|Defender of the Fatherland Day]] in [[Nur-Sultan]].]]\n\nThe oldest, largest and most famous regular military parade in [[Europe]] is the [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] which is held each 14 July, on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in [[Paris]], during [[Bastille Day|France's national day]] celebrations.<ref name=\"paris1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.com/paris_city_guide/city_visits_of_paris/champs_elysees_arc_de_triomphe |title=Champs-Elys\u00e9es city visit in Paris, France - Recommended city visit of Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris |publisher=Paris.com |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807091009/http://www.paris.com/paris_city_guide/city_visits_of_paris/champs_elysees_arc_de_triomphe |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}</ref><ref name=\"paris-attractions1\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://paris-attractions.net/celebrate-bastille-day-in-paris-this-year/\n |title=Celebrate Bastille Day in Paris This Year\n |publisher=Paris Attractions |date=2011-05-03\n |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326174027/http://paris-attractions.net/celebrate-bastille-day-in-paris-this-year/\n |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Rationale==\n[[File:Queen's Birthday Parade, Hamilton Bermuda 2000.jpg|thumb|Queen's Birthday Parade, [[Hamilton, Bermuda]], 2000.]]\nA military drill is memorizing certain actions through repetition until the action is instinctive to the soldiers being drilled. Complex actions are broken down into simpler ones which can be practised in isolation so when the whole is put together the desired results are achieved. Such is necessary for a fighting force to perform at maximum efficiency in all manner of situations. However, depending on the army and the drills it adopts, drilling may destroy flexibility and initiative in exchange for predictability and cohesion.\n\nRecruits in most modern militaries are taught drill to teach them how to work and move as a team. In addition, formations are still used in [[riot control]], where m\u00eal\u00e9e combat is still the norm.\n\n==Four directions==\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-5.jpeg|thumb|[[2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]\nParades consist of four directions:\n# Advance\n# Retire\n# Left\n# Right\n\nThe Advance is the primary direction of movement, regardless of which direction the soldiers are actually facing (similar to a ship's [[Bow (ship)|bow]].) On a parade square, the advance is determined by the position of the [[dais]] or flags. When these are not present, the direction of the drill commander is the advance.\n\nThe Retire is opposite to the advance, against the primary direction of movement (similar to a ship's [[stern]].)\n\nThe Left is to the left of the Advance (similar to a ship's [[Port (nautical)|port]].)\n\nThe Right is to the right of the Advance (similar to a ship's [[starboard]].)\n\nIf the Advance is changed, then all other directions are changed to be based on the new Advance.\n\nThere is only one person in charge of a parade at a time. Changing this person is very ceremonious. This is to make it obvious to the soldiers who is currently in command and therefore to whom to pay attention.\n\nDuring parades, unless explicitly told otherwise, soldiers have restricted movement, meaning they can move only exactly when they are told, and then doing only exactly what they are told to do. In most stances, any movement at all is disallowed and is held to such an extent as to have soldiers fainting on parade, although fainting under any conditions short of plural hours standing still in the hot sun is considered a sign of medical disability.<ref name=indianman>{{cite web|last=Srivastava|first=Vikram|title=Drills and Parades|url=http://bprd.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/File965.pdf|work=Police Drill Manual|publisher=Bureau of Police Research and Development, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=21 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206154713/http://bprd.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/File965.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAmerican usage allows the service member to be at four states of alert:\n# [[At attention|Attention]]: standing straight, eyes forward, chest out, knees straight but not locked, feet together at a 45-degree angle.\n# Parade Rest: A modified position of attention in which the left foot is moved to shoulder width (typically measured as exactly 12 inches) and the hands are placed in the small of the back with the right hand placed inside the left with all fingers together and pointing rigidly straight (exception: U.S. Air Force usage is modelled after Commonwealth practice - see below).\n# Stand At Ease: Same as Parade Rest, but the soldier may look at the speaker.\n# At Ease: The service member is allowed to move around all but the right foot, but must remain silent.\n# Rest: Service member may talk, smoke (if command authorized) and may move as long as their right pivot foot remains grounded.\nA formation must be brought to the position of attention before it can go to a higher state of alert.<ref name=\"army\">FM 22-5, Drill and Ceremonies, Headquarters, Department of the Army, 1986</ref><ref name=\"marine\">NAVMC 2691 Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual, Headquarters, United States Marine Corps, 1981</ref>\n\n[[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries allow four states of alert:\n# Attention: standing straight, eyes forward, heels together, feet at a 30-degree angle (540 mils). The hands are held in tight fists with the thumbs aligned with the seam of the trousers.\n# At Ease: a modified position of attention in which the left foot is moved to shoulder width and the hands are placed behind the back with arms fully extended. The right hand is placed inside the left. [[United States|U.S.]] military usage is \"Parade Rest.\"\n# Stand-Easy: Legs remain in the At Ease position, arms are brought to the sides to a more natural standing position. Member may relax their muscles and make minimal movements. U.S. usage is \"At Ease,\" however a common mistake in U.S. military practice confuses \"At Ease\" with \"Rest\" (below).\n# Relax: Legs remain at position at ease, member may make more significant movements or look around. Members may not move the feet. If the troops are not being addressed by a commander, they are generally allowed to talk quietly. U.S. usage is \"Rest.\"\n\n==Common parade commands==\n*'''Fall In'''. Have designated troops move into an already existing formation on the parade square and/or ground.\n*'''Fall Out'''. Have designated troops wheel out and to the right of their formation, then halt facing the parade commander to be dismissed.\n*'''Dis -Miss'''. Telling designated units to leave the parade square and stop drilling. \n*'''[Parade Size]/Parade, [Parade Size], Atten-Tion (Shun)''' (U.S.: '''Atten - Tion (Shun)'''). Have the soldiers uniformly adopt the [[At attention|Attention position]], the most constrictive position (with feet together), but the only position from which soldiers can actually be made to move. In the United States military, the position is defined as heels together, feet at a 45-degree angle, arms straight, palms inward with fingers naturally curled, thumbs along the seams of trousers, shoulders square and head erect, looking forward. In the Royal Navy, the order \"Shun\" is replaced with the order \"Ho\". For Example, the most common usage is \"Guard Ho!\" With a small pause between words.\n\n===Alignment commands===\n\n====Commonwealth version====\n[[Image:Royal Military College of Canada cadets drill in parade square, Stone Frigate 1880s.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets drill in Military parade square, in front of [[HMCS Stone Frigate|Stone Frigate]] 1880s]]\n*'''Right Dress''', - all personnel in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified (Elbow Dressing, Shoulder Dressing).  Some Armies, e.g. the Australian Army, will raise the left arm (the right arm holding the service weapon).\n*'''Left Dress''', - all personnel in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified (Elbow Dressing, Shoulder Dressing).\n*'''Inwards Dress/Centre Dress''', used when a parade is formed up in two or more groups with [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colours, Guidons, or Banners]] on parade.  This is used so that dressing is off the colours.  The formations to the left of the Colour Party will dress to the right and the formations to the right of the Colour Party will dress to the left.   All personnel to the right of the Colours in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. All personnel to the left of the colours in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. Some Armies, i.e. the Australian Army, will raise the left arm (the right arm holding the service weapon).  After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their left or right (depending on the direction of dressing), unless otherwise specified (Elbow Dressing, Shoulder Dressing).\n*'''Eyes Front''', following Right/Left/Inwards Dress, the front rank snaps their arms down and faces forward, while all other ranks simply face forward.\n\n====American version====\n*'''Dress Right, DRESS''' - all personnel in the unit except the soldiers at the far left bring up their left arms parallel to the ground and at the same time snap their heads so they are facing right.  The person on the far right will keep his head straight. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their left.  If the command is preceded by '''\"At Close Interval\"''', the left arm is bent at the elbow rather than parallel to the ground.  If the command is preceded by '''\"At Double Interval\"''', both arms are extended.  '''\"Dress Left\"''' reverses the instructions (Right arm up, look left).\n*'''Ready, FRONT''' - all personnel snap their arms down and faces forward.\n*'''COVER''' - used after any movement is halted to realign the formation.  All personnel in the formation except the squad leaders make short, choppy steps to align themselves with their squad leaders, then come to attention.<ref name = \"army\"/><ref name = \"marine\"/>\n\n===Rest positions===\n[[File:A Member of the Queen's Guards, Guarding the Mall - geograph.org.uk - 1354107.jpg|thumb|190px|A British [[Household Division]] soldier in the position of at ease.]]\n[[File:120416-Z-KZ880-024 (7109575235).jpg|thumb|American honour guards in the ceremonial at ease position.]]\n*'''Stand at Ease''' (U.S.: '''PARADE REST'''). Have the soldiers adopt the more relaxed position At Ease position, with feet shoulder width apart, hands clasped behind back but with upper body half still in position of attention (chest out, shoulders back). This is typically used when soldiers must wait a short duration, ready to adopt the position of attention e.g. if waiting for an Officer to arrive for an inspection. Changing from At Ease to Attention and back again, or the converse, is standard when the command of a parade is transferred (typically between the commanding officer and his Sergeant-Major), since command of a formation is not actually transferred until the new commander makes a command. There is no talking allowed at Parade Rest; personnel must come to the position of attention before speaking.\n*'''Stand at Ease''' (U.S.) This is the same as Parade Rest, except that soldiers are expected to turn their heads to look at whoever is addressing them. This should not be confused with At Ease.\n*'''Stand Easy'''. (U.S.: '''AT EASE''') Have the soldiers adopt the next easiest stance, where hands are still clasped behind the back, however, the soldiers can relax their upper bodies (the shoulders can be slacked) and quietly speak. This is often, but not always, followed by an implicit 'Relax' ('Rest'). This is typically used when being addressed/lectured for a long period of time where the positions of attention or at ease would be too painful/uncomfortable to hold.\n*'''Relax''' (U.S.: '''REST''') The only parade instruction given in an ordinary voice, rather than the raised, emphatic parade voice. This is the only position that actually offers soldiers freedom of movement. Soldiers are typically allowed to move other than moving their feet, though, when it is given by a high-ranking officer, soldiers typically move a minimal amount after a bit of stretching.\n\n===Marching with weapons/saluting===\n'''[[Rifle]]s'''\n*'''Shoulder/Slope Arms''': Although Left and Right Shoulder Arms are both valid commands, left is assumed if it is unstated. Soldiers must be at attention to shoulder weapons. This is typically done through a throw rather than a carry. In British and Commonwealth parades, the command \"Slope Arms\" is used to order soldiers to place their rifles on the top of the shoulder. The command of \"Shoulder Arms\" in the Commonwealth and Britain, is done when a rifle is brought on the left or right sides by the shoulder with the carrying hand holding the pistol grip. In US ceremonies, if the soldiers have the weapons at the order, then it is brought up and carried on the right shoulder, and all shoulder commands must specify the shoulder, and may be performed while [[military step|marching in step]].\n*'''Port Arms''': The weapon is brought out in front of the soldier, and held by the right hand on small of the butt, or equivalent, and the left hand about the forestock, or equivalent. Usually this command is used for preparation of the Feu De Joie/Fire of Joy for parades. In the United States, Port Arms is the required carry position for marching at [[military step|double time]].\n*'''[[Present arms (command)|Present Arms]]''': The soldiers bring their weapons to the front of their bodies, and move adjust their right foot position. Soldiers without weapons use a salute appropriate for their headdress. Often officers can salute on behalf of their troops, and any such ambiguity will be discussed with the troops beforehand. This, in the case of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations, is often used with the precautionary General/Commander's Salute or Royal/Presidential/Prime Minister's Salute, when appropriate. In U.S. usage, all soldiers salute, except if he or she is holding a weapon. Guidons and organizational colors are dipped to 90 degrees above the ground (but not touching the ground, but in the Commonwealth it is common practice). The U.S. national colors are never dipped (it is also the case in Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Spain) but the British or Commonwealth national colors are dipped to the ground when the salute is performed. This command is used whenever saluting during ceremonial inspections in most countries (like Germany, France, Russia, Poland, Italy, Serbia and Ukraine as well as in Chile, Argentina, Ecuador and Colombia), and eyes are pointed to either the left, on the front, or the right to the direction of the honors being paid to. The command for recovery is \"Shoulder/Slope Arms!\" or \"Order Arms!\" depending on the situation.\n*'''Order Arms''': If the soldiers are carrying a weapon which can be ordered they will lower it so that is resting on the ground, touching the outer toes of the right boot, and being supported by a slightly bent right arm. Usually given in Shoulder/Slope Arms or Present Arms position.\n*'''Ground Arms''': The soldier takes a full pace forward, bending their knees, so the right leg is parallel to the floor below the knee, and at the same time leaning forward and laying their rifles down to the ground (ejection port up). They then take the appropriate pause time, then stand up into attention.\n*'''Trail Arms''': Same as Order Arms but with hands holding on the rifle above the ground.\n*'''Sling Arms''': If the soldiers have a \"[[sling (firearms)|sling]]\" (strap) on their rifles, then this command can be called. The soldiers will loosen the sling so they can now have their rifles strapped around their shoulders.\n*'''Unsling Arms''': Servicemen will unloosen the sling so they can now have their rifles at the port or high port position.\n*'''Front Sling Arms''': Servicemen holding weapons with slings attached to the chest now sling those weapons in the Port or High Port Arms position.\n*'''High Port Arms''': This is a higher variant of Port Arms, with both arms holding the weapon high. \n*'''Fire of Joy, load weapons''': This command is used in parades such as the [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade in Singapore]], and [[Trooping the Colour]]. The soldier will load the rifle with the blank round in preparation of the [[Feu de joie]], French for Fire of Joy in parades. This is called in Polish as the ''Salwa Honorowa'' or Honor Volley.\n*'''Fix Bayonets''': In US ceremonies, whenever the bayonets are to be fixed to the weapons, this command is called out. In times, the accompanying bugle call for it is used before the order is done. The troops pull out their bayonets from their uniforms and attach them to the weapon.\n*'''Unfix Bayonets''': Soldiers in formation remove their bayonets from their rifles and return them to their uniforms.\n\n'''[[Sabre]]s'''\n*'''Draw Sabres''': used to draw the sabres.\n*'''Return Sabres''': used to return the sabres.\n*'''Present Sabres''': used for officers to salute using their sabres.\n*'''Shoulder/Slope Sabres''': used for officers to slope the sabre in their left-hand shoulder.\n*'''Order Sabres''': the sabre is lowered to the ground after presenting or sloping.\n\n=== Forming the parade for the march past/pass in review ===\n[[File:Pass and Review.jpg|thumb|Marine Corps General [[Joseph Dunford]], takes part in a pass in review of the [[Ceremonial Guard (Canada)|Ceremonial Guard]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]].]]\n*'''Pass in Review''' - used in the US to denote the start of the march past segment of parades. When this command is said the parade prepares in readiness for the march past. It is also used as a way for a newly assigned commander to inspect the troops he/she commands.<ref>{{cite web | title=Air Force ROTC Detachment 225, Pass in Review | website=University of Notre Dame | date=2019-06-18 | url=https://afrotc.nd.edu/det-225-history/military-functions/pass-in-review/ | access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pass+in+review|title=Pass in Rview|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n* '''Parade, in close order, left/right dress''' - in the UK, this command is used to commence dressing of parade units in close order\n* '''Company, in close order, form three/four ranks''' - in the UK, this command is used to form companies into three or four ranks of personnel each\n* '''Staff behind me, (forward) march''' - in the US, this command is used by the parade commander to form his parade staff in readiness for the march past/pass in review segment of parades\n* '''Parade will now advance/retire in slow/quick time, about turn''' - in the Commonwealth the command is used to form parade formations when arranged in line formation for the march past\n\n===Compliments and Saluting===\n\n====Saluting on the march====\nIn the Commonwealth countries, the following saluting on the march commands are ordered with a preparatory command of ''''Saluting on the march...''''. For example, ''''Saluting on the march, to the front Salute'''' and always called on the left foot.\n*'''To the front Salute''' or '''Salute''': The parade is halted and the right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. This is lowered and then repeated again, followed by an about turn and a resume in marching (off the left foot). The timing is: \"Call, Check, Halt, 2, 3, Up, 2, 3, Down, 2, 3, 4, 5, Up, 2, 3, Down, 2, 3, About, 2, 3, In, 2, 3, Left, Right, Left!\" It is one of, if not the longest drill movement in the military.\nIn British Corps, the drill movement for saluting to the front is the following. Two, three, up. Two, three, down.\n*'''To the Right Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, four, five, down, swing!\"\n:This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n*'''To the Left Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, four, five, down, away!\"\n:This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker (as they are the front most of the saluting flank), who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n\nIn the United States, the command for saluting on the march is \"Eyes, RIGHT/LEFT.\" The parade leader and other officers execute the hand salute, while everyone but the right file or left file in either case turns their heads to the right.\" The command for recovery is \"Ready, FRONT.\" If the command does not have rifles, they will salute if given the command '''present ARMS'''. The arms will be lowered back to their normal position on the commands '''Order ARMS'''. They can also salute if given the command '''Hand SALUTE'''. The salute is raised when the parade leader finishes saying \"salute\", and is lowered in after being held for the same amount of time elapsed between the words \"hand\" and \"salute.\"\n\n=== Compliments on the March ===\n\n*'''Eyes Right''': The parade turn their heads to the right after a check pace. The parade leader salutes while looking in the direction they gave.\n:This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n*'''Eyes Left''': Similar to the '''Eyes Right''' except the parade looks to the left.\n:This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.\n\n====Saluting at the halt (static)====\n*'''To the front Salute''' or '''Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, down!\"\n*'''To the Right Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, down!\" \n*'''To the Left Salute''': The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90\u00b0 angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of \"Up, two, three, down!\"\nIn the United States, salutes at a halt are given on the command \"Hand Salute\". They are lowered in the same amount of time elapsed between the two words. The command \"present arms\" will cause the command to salute if the command is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with the command \"order arms\".\n*'''Advance in Review Order''': This is used to pay final compliments to the reviewing officer. On the command: ADVANCE IN REVIEW ORDER, BY THE CENTRE, QUICK...MARCH, the unit being reviewed advances 15 paces and halts automatically before presenting arms to the reviewing officer. It is usually employed by the [[British Army]] and the [[Canadian Army]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.2824cops.com/wp-content/uploads/Army-Cadet-Reference-Manual.pdf|title=Royal Canadian Army Cadets: Cadet Reference Book|publisher=National Defence|year=2001|location=Canada|oclc=289058362|id=A-CR-CCP-121/PT-001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/cgi-bin/forum/archive2006_config.pl?md=read;id=67469|title=Historical Need for Drill|website=www.napoleon-series.org}}</ref>\n\n===Colour commands===\n\n====Marching with colours====\n*'''Let Fly the Colours''': The colours are normally held in a semi-taut position. This is a simple, ceremonial letting fly and catching of the colours.\n*'''Slant Colours''': The colours are normally kept upright, but this can represent a problem both when dealing with standard doors. This slants the colours forward sufficiently to negate this, and they are brought back up afterward.\n*'''Slope/Shoulder Colours''': The normal method for carrying colours can be tiresome for the bearer. This has the colours taken out of their frogs and sloped over the right shoulder at about 45\u00b0.\n\n====Colour commands at the halt (static)====\n*'''Order Colours''': Essentially the same as Order Arms, except used exclusively for the Colour Party.\n*'''Carry Colours''': This is equivalent to Shoulder Arms. The right arm lifts the colours up so they line up with the body's centre line, with the right arm held in front of the soldier, at mouth level parallel to the ground. It is caught and guided into its frog with left hand, which is then returned to its side.\n*'''Change colours''': This is used when the senior flag officer decides that he/she and the other flag holding members, have held their flags for a long time, and that their arms are tired, so, when the command \"Change - colours!\" is given, the flag holders put their arms in line with the flag, their other hand on top of their first hand and move the first hand down to attention, so that the other hand is now at the first hands' original position.\n\n===Turning motions===\n\n===Turning motions at the march===\n*'''Right Turn''' (U.S.:'''Column right, MARCH'''): A 90\u00b0 turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball. The cautionary and executive are both called on the left foot. The left leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground (although exceptions are made for kilted regiments) and slammed into the ground in the position of attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.\n*'''Left Turn''' (U.S.:'''Column left, MARCH'''): A 90\u00b0 turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. The right leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground and slammed down into attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.\n*'''About Turn''' (U.S.: '''To the rear, MARCH'''): A 180\u00b0 turn to the right, done as an exaggerated version of the right turn. United States units do not make exaggerated gestures with the legs or arms.\n*'''Right Flank MARCH''' or '''Right turn''', it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching execute 90\u00b0 turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball.\n*'''Left Flank MARCH''' or '''Left turn''', it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching 90\u00b0 turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.\n*'''Right Incline''' (U.S.:'''Column half-right, MARCH'''), is a half turn to the right, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45\u00b0 to the right, done by rotation on the left ball and the right heel.\n*'''Left Incline''' (U.S.:'''Column half-left, MARCH'''), is a half turn to the left, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45\u00b0 to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.\n*'''Right Wheel''', is a turn to the right, differentiated from a Right Turn in that the order of march remains the same. \n*'''Left Wheel''', is a mirror of the Right Wheel.\n\n====Turning motions at the halt (static)====\n\n'''[[United States Armed Forces]]:'''\n\n*'''Right Face''': The body is rotated on the heel of the right foot and then the left heel is brought forward to meet the right heel in the position of attention.\n*'''Left Face''': A mirror image of Right Face.\n*'''About Face''': The right toe is brought back to behind the left heel; the body pivots on the right toe and left heel 180\u00b0.\n*'''Half-Left Face''': Exactly the same as a left face, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n*'''Half-Right Face''': Exactly the same as a right face, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n\n'''[[Commonwealth of Nations]]'''\n\n*'''Right Turn''': The body is rotated 90\u00b0 to the right members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy, the heel movements mirror that of the US Armed Forces.\n*'''Left Turn''': A mirror image of Right Turn.\n*'''About Turn''': The body is rotated 180\u00b0 in a clockwise direction, knees locked. Members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy heel movements are the same for Right Face.\n*'''Right Incline''': Exactly the same as a right turn, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n*'''Left Incline''': Exactly the same as a left turn, but one turns only 45\u00b0.\n\n===Marching motions===\n{{main|Military step}}\n*'''Quick March''': The standard pace is typically 116 beats/minute with a 30in. step.  There is also a '''Rifleman's Pace''', 140 beats/minute and a '''Highland Pace''', 110 beats/minute (typically done with a kilt.) The pace is based on the individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band's rhythm. The way the march is performed depends on the regiment's nationality.\n*'''Slow March''': This is a ceremonial pace, used for funerals and when a unit's colours are marched out in front of the troops. The standard pace is 65 beats per minute.\n*'''Half Step March''' or '''Cut the pace''':\n:*This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as Quick Time, but instead of 30 inches, the step is 15 inches.\n:*There is also a Canadian and Commonwealth version of this, used for when the front file/rank is getting too far ahead of the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, it means that front file/rank should make their steps smaller, to allow for the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, to get back into proper dressing.\n*'''Double March''': This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of Quick Time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is '''\"Double Time, MARCH.\"'''\n*'''Easy March''': This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is '''\"Route Step, MARCH.\"''' In the Canadian Forces the command '''\"March at, EASE\"''' is given while the unit is on the march. It can not be given from the halt.\n*'''[[Military mark time|Mark Time]]''': This is essentially a [[Military mark time|stationary march]] with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off of the ground. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed. The U.S. equivalent command is \"'''Mark Time, MARCH'''.\"\n*'''Step For -Ward''' or '''Forward''' or '''Forward, March''': This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march.\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:2013. \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0435 181.jpg|thumb|Cadets parade in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]].]]\n\nDrill is today used to demonstrate discipline and cohesion in a modern military force. Large military parades are today held on major holidays and military events around the world. It usually held on occasions of national importance such as a country's independence day, and therefore is presided over by the head of state who, in most cases, is the commander in chief of the combined national military forces of that country. Today, military parades include all aspects of military drill, from an [[exhibition drill]] of precision drill teams and [[military band]]s (in addition to the occasional [[corps of drums]], [[fanfare band]], and/or [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]]), as well as an exhibition of military weapons such as a mobile column, the occasional mounted cavalry column (led by a [[mounted band]]), a naval parade, and a fly past by the country's [[air force]]. When on parade, most of the participating soldiers wear their [[Full dress uniform|ceremonial uniforms]] and carry the standards/colours of their respective battalions/regiments/corps/academies. In many countries, the military contingent is joined by contingents from youth cadet organizations, personnel from the police and fire services and by occasion jail and border services, youth police and fire cadets, veterans and personnel of the civil service.\n\n===By country ===\n==== Albania ====\n[[Albania]] has long been influenced by Greek and Italian influences and even Soviet/Russian tradition. During the era of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Liberation Day (Albania)|Liberation Day]], which then the main national holiday, was celebrated with a military parade of the [[Albanian People's Army]] on [[Tirana]]'s [[D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard]]. These parades have been held in 1954,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Current Digest of the Soviet Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvMRAAAAIAAJ|volume=Vol 6|year=1954|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.}}</ref> 1959,<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service|title=Daily Report: Foreign Radio Broadcasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wi0jAQAAMAAJ|year=1959}}</ref> 1964, 1974,<ref>{{cite book|title=Daily Report: People's Republic of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5sbAQAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=U.S. Foreign Broadcast Information Service}}</ref> 1984<ref>{{cite book|title=Soviet Analyst|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrVpAAAAMAAJ|volume=13-14|year=1984}}</ref> and 1989.

One of the more notable modern military parades was held on the [[100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania]], in which a special unit of 65 soldiers from the [[Kosovo Security Force]] as well as other foreign contingents participated. The other took place on 4 December 2007 in honor of the 95th anniversary of the [[Albanian Armed Forces]].<ref>https://aaf.mil.al/index.php/arkivi/dhjetor-2007/1403-parade-ushtarake-madheshtore-me-rastin-e-95-vjetorit-te-krijimit-te-forcave-te-armatosura-shqiptare</ref>\n\n==== Argentina ====\nArgentina's long history of military parades are a heritage inherited from the times of the Spanish colonial Viceroyality of Rio de la Plata, with influences from Germany, France, Britain and Italy. Today the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], together with the paramilitary [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] and [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]] hosts massive military parades featuring armed companies, cadets, and military bands on the following days (national events unless otherwise noted):\n\n* January 24 - anniversary of the beginning of the Crossing of the Andes (local commemoration)\n* February 3 - anniversary of the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] (local commemoration)\n* April 2 - [[Malvinas Day|Falklands War Veterans' Day]]\n* May 10 - anniversary of Air Force baptism of fire in the [[Falklands War]]\n* May 17 - Navy Day, anniversary of the victory at the [[Battle of Buceo]]\n* May 25 - [[First National Government|First National Government Anniversary Day]]\n* May 29 - Army Day\n* June 17 -  General Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes Memorial Day (local commemoration)\n* June 20 - [[Flag Day (Argentina)|Flag Day]]\n* June 30 - Naval Prefecture Day\n* July 9 - [[Argentine Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n* July 28 - National Gendarmerie Day\n* August 10 - Air Force Day\n* September 24 - Battle of Tucuman Day (local commemoration)\n* November 20 - [[National Sovereignty Day]]\n\n==== Australia and New Zealand ====\nAs both Commonwealth realms, Australia and New Zealand share the customs and traditions of parades of the British Armed Forces. The friendship and cooperation of the defence services of both countries can be seen in the annual [[Anzac Day]] parades every 25 April, in memory of the namesake [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], which was heavily involved in the long [[Battle of Gallipoli]] and were the first Allied forces to land there on that day in 1915. On this day, in many major cities in these two countries, parades are held involving personnel of both the [[Australian Defence Force]] and the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], veterans' organizations, cadet organizations and other youth uniformed groups and personnel of the police and fire services, as well as students of schools and universities honoring many of their fallen alumni of the long campaign.\n\nParades are also held jointly in these two countries on 11 November, Remembrance Day.\n\nAside from these two days, the schedule of annual military and civil parades held in these two countries is as follows:\n\n* For parades in Australia:\n** National level parades are held on:\n*** 26 January, Australia Day\n*** The second  Monday of June, the Queen's Birthday, marked in most of Eastern Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory\n**** typically the last Monday of September or the first Monday of October, Queen's Birthday Holiday for Western Australia\n**** 1st Monday in October, Queen's Birthday Holiday for Queensland\n** Local parades involving armed forces, police and fire personnel are held on:\n*** 2nd Monday in March in the ACT, Canberra Day\n*** 6 June in Queensland, Queensland Day\n*** first Monday in June in Western Australia, Western Australia Day\n*** first working day after Christmas Day, Proclamation Day in South Australia\n** Parades are also held in the following cases:\n*** during change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet [[Passing out (military)|passing out parades]] and regimental anniversaries within the service branches of the ADF and all military academies\n*** During holiday parades held in major cities as can be permitted by the commander of the unit taking part, including:\n**** the AFL Grand Final Parade in Melbourne\n* For parades in New Zealand:\n** National level parades are held on:\n*** 6 February, Waitangi Day\n*** on the 1st Monday in June, the Queen's Birthday\n** Local parades involving armed forces, police and fire personnel are held within the anniversary days of the former [[Provinces of New Zealand]], which were abolished in 1876, the days of which are as set by their respective district and city governments.\n** Change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet graduation parades, together with regimental anniversary parades, are also held occasionally within the service branches of the NZDF and its training institutions.\n\n==== Canada ====\nWithin Canada, the now tri-service [[Ceremonial Guard]] performs the marchpast for senior dignitaries of the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] during change of command ceremonies and state arrival ceremonies, typically held in [[Ottawa]], the national capital. The two [[Primary Reserve]] [[Canadian Army]] regiments that typically provide personnel for the guard, the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] and [[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]], together with the [[Governor General's Horse Guards]] and guard of honour detachments from both the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] take part in these events. In addition, the CG and optionally both the GGHG and the CGG take part in military parades such as the more common [[Trooping the Colour]], also in Ottawa and special parades during the jubilee years of the monarch or of national foundation. The CAF personnel, as well as the [[Canadian Cadet Organizations]] and military veterans also parade during national holidays such as [[Remembrance Day]], [[Victoria Day]], [[Canada Day]] or [[Canadian Forces Day]], as well as during parades celebrating anniversaries of regiments, brigade groups or wings, and divisional level formations and passing out parades of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] and recruit training bases, as well as in local holidays in the provinces and major cities. Across the country, the annual Warriors Day military parade has since 1921, been a traditional event of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. It is specifically devoted to formally recognizing veterans of the CF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewarriorsdayparade.ca/Parade%20History-Guide.html|title=The Warriors' Day Parade - History Guide}}</ref> Like in the UK, the [[Authorized marches of the Canadian Armed Forces|regimental march of the unit]] being honored is played by the band and/or [[pipe band]] if present.\n\n==== Chile ====\nThe tradition of military parades in Chile has origins not just in Spanish tradition, but also a mix between those of France, the United Kingdom, and particularly Germany, given the fact that Imperial German Army officers trained the army and navy in the mid-1890s in the Prussian-German traditions of military parades that are continued until today.\n\nCurrently, the [[Chilean Armed Forces]] and the [[Carabineros de Chile]] hold public parades in front of state leaders and the public on\n\n* 21 May - [[Navy Day (Chile)|Navy Day]] - honoring the fallen of the 1879 [[Battle of Iquique]], also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the [[Chilean Navy]]\n* 19 September - [[Great Military Parade of Chile|Army Day]] - while honoring the 1810 anniversary of the formal inauguration of the First Government Junta, is also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the [[Chilean Army]]\n\nLocal level parades are marked on the following days aside from 21 May:\n\n* 17 February  - anniversary of the victory in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]]\n* 21 March - Air Force Day\n* 2 April - anniversary of the victory in the [[Battle of Maipu]]\n* 27 April - Carabineros Day\n* 7 June - anniversary of the victory in the [[Battle of Arica]]\n* 9 July  - Flag Day\n* 20 August - birthday of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]]\n* 18 September - Independence Day\n* 2 October - anniversary of the [[Battle of Rancagua]]\n* 30 November - [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] Day\n\n==== China ====\nThe first military parade on the Chinese mainland can be dated to over 4,000 years ago, when [[Yu the Great]], a legendary ruler in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], hosted a gathering of tribal forces from northern and southern China.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=llmCOvtWcUcC&pg=PA76&dq=chinese+military+parade+1984&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4wKiB1IXlAhUQIKwKHfsJBp8Q6AEISTAF#v=onepage&q=chinese%20military%20parade%201984&f=false</ref>\n\n===== People's Republic of China =====\n{{See also|Military parades in Hong Kong}}\n{{external media|align=right|width=250px|video1=Parts [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmnAg_e9Dk 1] [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy_Kyq5iCzE 2] [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy_Kyq5iCzE 3] and [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4WJNtiHiZJQ 4] of a documentary on the history of Chinese military parades|align2=right|width2=250px|video2=[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ZfByEEYmg 1981 \u65b0\u7586 \u5927\u9605\u5175 Chinese Uighur Military Parade in Xinjiang (Eng narration)]}}\nThe People's Republic of China holds extraordinary military parades in Beijing to celebrate [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]]. The first parade of this nature took place right after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China]] by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] on 1 October 1949. Originally celebrated annually, the parade was suspended in 1960, before returning in 1984 to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. It is now held to mark every tenth anniversary, starting in 1999. Parades were also held in 1964, 1966, 1969 and 1970.<ref>https://www.frstrategie.org/en/publications/strategic-imagery/military-parade-70th-anniversary-prc-revealing-example-chinese-strategic-power-2019</ref>\n\nIn 2015, China held a [[2015 China Victory Day Parade|military parade]] to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the [[Victory over Japan Day|Victory over Japan]]. This was the first time China held a military parade for an event other than its National Day. It is currently unknown if China will continue to celebrate the end of World War II, through.\n\nIn 2017, the 90th anniversary since the [[Nanchang Uprising]] and the beginning of the [[People's Liberation Army]] was marked by a [[2017 PLA Day Parade|military parade]], the first time ever that a military parade had been held in its honor and the first time it was held outside of the capital, having been held at [[Zhurihe Training Base]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] under the direction of General [[Han Weiguo]] of the [[Central Theater Command]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-defence/chinas-xi-calls-for-building-elite-forces-during-massive-military-parade-idUSKBN1AF00J|title=China's Xi calls for building elite forces during massive military parade|first=Michael|last=Martina|first2=Ben|last2=Blanchard|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 29, 2017|editor-first=Kim|editor-last=Coghill|editor-first2=Sam|editor-last2=Holmes}}</ref><ref>https://www.chinadailyhk.com/articles/50/38/44/1501474883058.html</ref> This was also the first field parade to take place since September 1981 when a parade consisting of troops participating in an excersise in [[Zhangjiakou]] in the presence of [[Deng Xiaoping]] to commemorate Deng's assumption to the post of [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]. During that parade, Deng reportedly said \"Let\u2019s hold a large-scale one if we are to hold a military exercise, so that it can be of use\" in reference to the size of the parade.<ref>https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2079193/massive-parade-tipped-plas-90th-birthday</ref> Naval parades have also been reintroduced in recent years with a [[2018 South China Sea Parade|parade]] (which was the biggest naval review since 1949 and according to the Chinese government, the biggest in 600 years.<ref>https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/superpower-china-claims-biggest-naval-parade-600-years-25403</ref>) being held in the [[South China Sea]] in 2018 and a [[PLA Navy Platinum Jubilee Parade|parade]] for the [[platinum jubilee]] of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] being held in early 2019.\n\nSmaller scale parades are also periodically held in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]].

This practice was abandoned in 1991 though parades were recently held every five years beginning in 2011 during the [[100th Anniversary of the Republic of China|Xinhai Revolution centenary]] and again in 2016. Special parades were held outside Taipei in 1995 and 2015 marking the 50th and 70th anniversaries, respectively, of both the Allied victory in the Second World War and the conclusion of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\n==== Colombia ====\nBoth the [[Military Forces of Colombia]] and the [[National Police of Colombia]] hold important national parades to celebrate the anniversary of national independence as well as of the Armed Forces. Such parades are a mix of the Spanish, German, French, American and British influences owing to the long history of the country's military and police forces. National level parades are held on:\n\n* February 15 - Air Force Day \n* July 20 - [[Colombian Independence Day parade|Independence Day]]\n* July 24 - Navy Day \n* August 7 - Army Day and [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1|Battle of Boyaca Victory Day]]\n* November 15 - National Police Day\n\nLocal level parades by the personnel and veterans of the armed forces and police are held on the following:\n\n* April 7 - Barranquilla Day\n* July 3 - Cali Independence Day\n* November 11 - Cartagena Independence Day\n\n==== Cuba ====\nThe [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] generally holds military parades in honor of the [[Day of the Cuban Armed Forces]] and the [[Triumph of the Revolution]] on [[Havana]]'s [[Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n]]. The first parade took place in 1960 for the latter event and over time, importance was transferred to Armed Forces Day in relation to military parades. In 2011, a special honor parade was held on April 16 to commemorate the [[golden jubilee]] since the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref>https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-04-16/cuba-marks-victory-socialism</ref> The largest parade to be held took place in December 1986 in honor of the 30th anniversary of the revolution, in which General [[Humberto Ortega]] from [[Nicaragua]] as well as officials from the [[Soviet Union]] attended.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=7z1mvx29XMgC&pg=PA589&dq=military+parade+in+cuba+1986&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8so7g9oHmAhUP2qwKHZwTBuUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=military%20parade%20in%20cuba%201986&f=false</ref> The [[diamond jubilee]] parade planned for 2016 was postponed for 1 month due to the [[death and state funeral of Fidel Castro]], and took place during the Victory Day celebrations on 2 January 2017.<ref>http://www.cubagob.cu/otras_info/minfar/granma.htm</ref><ref>http://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?o=rn&id=135863&SEO=conmemoran-en-angola-dia-de-las-fuerzas-armadas-de-cuba</ref>\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n[[File:Vojenska prehlidka 1985b.jpg|thumb|A parade of tanks of the \u010cSLA in Prague on [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]], 9 May 1985.]]\n{{external media|align=right|width=250px|video1=[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EApCYZR-NMk Czechoslovak Military Parade \"Shield-84\" - Vojensk\u00e1 p\u0159ehl\u00eddka \u010cSLA \"\u0160t\u00edt-84]}}\nLarge mlitary parades in the [[Czech Republic]] are today held every 10 years in the capital of [[Prague]], encompassing personnel from the [[Czech Army]] and the [[Police of the Czech Republic]].

Regular military parades were held during the period of the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], with the first parades being organized in the 1950s. The first parade of the [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] (\u010cSLA) took place in 1951 in [[Letn\u00e1]]. Since then, parades were held every five years on 9 May to mark the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Prague uprising|Liberation of Czechoslovakia]]. To honor the latter's celebrations, the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] would be performed by the massed bands on parade preceded by the [[Kde domov m\u016fj|Czechoslovakian national anthem]].

It is currently the oldest and largest military parade on the European continent. It is held on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and passes from l'[[Arc de Triomphe]] to [[Place de la Concorde]]. Bastille Day parades are also held in smaller garrison towns such as [[Toulon]] and [[Belfort]]. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the [[French Republican Guard]] regularly performs ceremonial marchpasts in is role as the [[guard of honour]] for the [[President of the French Republic]]. Like the British, many French units have the ability to march in quick time, while only one - the [[French Foreign Legion]] - marches uniquely in slow time, while another unit of the armed forces marches in very quick time and that is of the Army's [[Chasseurs]], especially its [[Chasseurs alpins]].\n\nLocal parades are held on the following days:\n\n* May 8 - [[Victory in Europe Day]]\n* November 11 - Armistice Day\n* Anniversaries of important battles fought by the French Armed Forces\n\n==== Germany ====\nThe [[Germany]] has had a long tradition of military parades dating back to the days of [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and its army and navy. It was the Prussians who invented the [[goose step]], a style of marching that was used in many German armies as well as in the militaries of various countries, which were instructed by Prussian military training officers and instructors from the 19th century to the early 20th.\n\nDuring the [[Nazi era]], military parades were commonplace as they were held as a sort of victory parade for the German [[Wehrmacht]] as they invaded countries during the Second World War. The first major parades took place in [[Nuremberg]] in September 1938 and [[Adolf Hitler's 50th birthday]] in April 1939. In the months Immediately after the [[German invasion of Poland]], a [[German\u2013Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk|joint German\u2013Soviet military parade]] took place in [[Brest-Litovsk]] (now [[Brest, Belarus]]). In [[Allied-occupied Germany]], the major powers held parades through the center of Berlin to honor their victory. These include the [[Berlin Victory Parade of 1945]], [[1945 British Berlin Victory Parade]] and [[Berlin Victory Parade of 1946]].\n\nIn the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), parades were held according to the Russian standard, although the [[Soviet Army]] allowed the East Germans to use the Prussian tradition, something that had been dropped by their West German counterparts in the 50s. In the GDR, parades were held on the following occasions:\n\n*NVA Day (3 March)\n*[[International Workers' Day]] (1 May)\n*[[Liberation Day|Tag der Befreiung]] (8 May)\n*[[Republic Day (East Germany)|Tag der Republik]] (7 October)\n\nThe first parade took place on 1 May 1956 in the presence of [[President of East Germany|President]] [[Wilhelm Pieck]].<ref>https://www.mdr.de/zeitreise/erster-mai-ddr-politparade-volksfest100.html</ref> In the 60s and early 70s, parades took place on the western half of the [[Palace of the Republic, Berlin|Palace of the Republic]], which was intended as a military parade ground, even though tremors from the heavy vehicles proved dangerous due to the glass facade. By 1979, the western half was used mainly as a parking lot and military parades were moved to [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] in central Berlin.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F029232-0004, N\u00fcrburgring, Bundeswehrparade zum NATO-Jubil\u00e4um.jpg|thumb|[[Bundeswehr]] personnel on the [[N\u00fcrburgring]].]]\nIn 1969, the first military parade of [[West Germany]] and later the entire [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was held on the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] in the town of [[N\u00fcrburg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].<ref>http://www.hawkies.de/chronik-39.html</ref> It took place on 6 June 1969 and was held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).<ref>https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/GJQUEWUHL6MHFEI7OOLMIOGW4VZT7UTU</ref> It was attended by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] in his position as [[Federal Chancellor of Germany]]. Participating foreign and national units included those from the [[Bundeswehr]], [[Canadian Forces Europe]], [[United States Army Europe]], as well as army contingents from [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Allied parades were also held later in the country's 40-year existence.\n\nToday, military parades are held on the following holidays on a smaller scale:\n\n* Remembrance Day of [[July 20 plot|July 20]]\n* [[German Unity Day]] (October 3)\n* Passing out parades of NCO training schools and officer training institutions\n\n==== Greece ====\nThe long history of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]] and the role played in the defense and progress of the country are recalled in splendid and grand military parades that are held in major cities in the country following a hybrid of the British, French, Danish and German traditions on the following dates:\n\n* 25 March - [[Greek Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n* 28 October - Ohi Day\n* On Liberation Days of major cities and towns, honoring the Greek fallen of the Second World War and the later Greek Civil War\n\n==== India ====\nThe [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]] is held annually in [[Delhi]] to mark the Republic Day of [[India]]. Parades are also held on the service holidays: [[Army Day (India)|Army Day]], Navy Day and Air Force Day.\n\n==== Mongolia ====\nMilitary parades in [[Mongolia]] have a long tradition that dates back to the era of the [[Mongol Empire]].

Air force of Poland.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Air Force]] ceremonial guard during the Armed Forces Day parade.]]\nThe [[Polish Armed Forces]] and the [[Police of Poland]] holds two yearly military parades ({{lang-pl|Defilada wojskowa}}) in the capital of [[Warsaw]]: The [[Armed Forces Day (Poland)|Armed Forces Day]] parade through [[Ujazd\u00f3w Avenue]] and the [[National Independence Day (Poland)|National Independence Day]] parade near the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] on [[Pi\u0142sudski Square]]. Both of these parades include [[NATO]] personnel stationed near or inside the country. The Armed Forces Day Parade was introduced in 2007 and 2008 as first grand military parades since the holiday was reinstated and have been held yearly since 2013. The first Polish military parade took place on 17 January 1945. Prior to 1989, parades were held in front of the [[Palace of Culture and Science]] on [[Parade Square]] on 22 July commemorate the [[National Day of the Rebirth of Poland]] celebrations, honoring the anniversary of the signing of the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-sponsored [[PKWN Manifesto]]. Back then, the [[People's Republic of Poland]] used many Russian traditions in regards to military parades, especially the inspection by the Minister of Defence. In 1966, during the millennium celebrations of the [[Christianization of Poland]], a parade was held on 22 July which included cadets of military academies and personnel of Polish ceremonial units dressed in historical military uniforms dating back to the [[Piast dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Polish Chronicle | website=KronikaRP | url=http://www.kronikarp.pl/pop-up.php?id=58989&type=2 | language=pl | access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://phistory.info/photo-history/679-rycari-v-kinorekvizite-uchastvuyut-v-parade-v-chest-1000-letiya-polskogo-gosudarstva.html|title=Knights (in Film Props) Participate in a Parade in Honor of the 1000th Anniversary of the Polish State|date=2019-07-14|website=phistory.info|language=ru|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref> A [[1985 Warsaw Victory Day Parade|special parade]] was held on 9 May 1985 to honor the 40th anniversary of the Victory in Europe and the servicemen of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the East. In 2019, a 3rd was added when the yearly [[3 May Constitution Day]] parades, last held in 1939 and were held off and on since 1990, were officially reinstated.\n\n==== Russia and ex-Soviet countries ====\n[[File:Naval Academy 1983.jpg|thumb|The [[N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy]], led by Captain Anatoliy Karpenko, during a parade on [[Leningrad]]'s [[Palace Square]] in 1983.]]\nThe Western tradition of military parades in the [[Russian Empire]] was part of the many reforms made by [[Peter the Great]] as part of his many efforts to transform the army and the navy from traditional militias to a full-blown professional armed service that is a model for the people in discipline and obedience, courage, bravery, loyalty to the country and in bringing pride and glory to her people. During the Imperial period, national parades were alternated between [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] on major national civil and military holidays, anniversaries of the Romanov Dynasty and as part of the imperial coronation celebrations, celebrations and parades were also held in many major cities and provincial capitals.\n\nSo important was the value of these parades that even the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] made these parades a common tradition beginning in August 1918 when the first modern parade was held in Moscow's [[Red Square]] when Moscow area [[Vsevobuch]] detachments march past, earlier that May, a [[1918 May 1 Parade|military parade]], the first by the nascent [[Red Army]], was held outside the capital. Since that year, many innovations have been seen in the practice of annual parades held not just there but in the capital cities of the former [[Soviet Union]], as well as in major cities in the wide country, which were held on 1 May (1918-1941 and 1945-1968), [[October Revolution Day|7 November]] (1920-1941 and 1945-1990) and [[Victory Day Parades|9 May]] (1945, 1965, 1985 and 1990). Today, the [[Russian Armed Forces]] - and by extension countries of the former Soviet Union - host a variety of military parades held on important national holidays, honoring the men and women of their armed forces and military veterans. The celebrations in each of these countries carry on years of tradition, honor, discipline and prestige by the millions of men and women who serve and have served in the ranks of the armed forces of their respective home countries. These parades have extensive government funding and aside from the iconic wide march past columns and occasional historical formations, typically include a mobile column, and occasionally a naval fleet review and/or air force fly past segment, a legacy of the Soviet era.\n\n[[File:4Samarin.jpg|thumb|A Russian Armed Forces Honour Parade on [[Red Square]] in November 2018.]]\n\n===== Armenia =====\nWhile the country was a Soviet Republic from 1920 to 1991, Armenia was formerly independent from 1918 to 1920 and thus had armed forces composed of both veterans of the Imperial Army and guerillas fighting the Ottoman armed forces who had been enforcing the anti-Armenian massacres of 1914. Armenians fought bravery in the Eastern Front of the Second World War as part of the Soviet Armed Forces, retaining some of its traditions today. The last of the Soviet era parades took place in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.am/hy/news/2015/07/10/%D4%B1%D6%80%D5%B1%D5%A1%D5%B6/19710|title=Talking Monuments.

The forces on parade are assembled based on a mix of the Turkish and Russian parade formation.\n\n===== Belarus =====\nThe [[Armed Forces of Belarus]] holds an annual military parade on 3 July along the [[Victors Avenue]] in the national capital [[Minsk]], marking the anniversary of the liberation of the country during the 1944 [[Minsk Offensive]], which coincides with the country's [[Independence Day (Belarus)|Independence Day]]. On special years of the victory in Europe, commemorative extraordinary parades are held there on 9 May to honor the millions of Belarusian military dead of the [[Second World War]]. Military parades in the country are based on the Russian/Polish model and tradition. Formerly, parades in the [[Republic of Belarus]] and the [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]] took place on [[Independence Square, Minsk|Independence Square]] (known in the Soviet era as Lenin Square). This changed in the early 2000s when the square was renovated and became incompatible with the parade format. Military parades in the BSSR also took place on [[October Square, Minsk|October Square]] from 1946 to 1984. Since 2004, military parades in the capital have taken place on [[Victors Avenue]]. In connection with the centennial of the Belarusian Armed Forces in 2018, a military parade was held in the Western city of [[Grodno]].\n\n===== Estonia =====\nWhile being formerly independent from 1918 to 1940 and as a component republic of the Soviet Union from that year to 1941 and yet again from 1944 to 1991, the current [[Estonian Defence Forces]] and the [[Estonian Defence League]], successor to both the military and reserve forces of the First Republic and republican formations under the Baltic Military District and Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Armed Forces, marches during a combination of Russian, Finnish and Western drill in parades held in the following days:\n\n* February 24 - [[Independence Day (Estonia)|Independence Day]]\n* June 24 - [[V\u00f5idup\u00fcha|Victory Day]]\n\nDuring the 2006 Victory Day Parade in [[Saaremaa]], the first ever Fleet Review of the [[Estonian Navy]] in Estonian history was conducted by the [[Estonian Defence League]].\n\n===== Georgia ===== \nThe [[Defense Forces of Georgia]], successor to the armed services of the Democratic Republic and Soviet formations stationed in the Georgian SSR, hosts military parades on May 26, [[Independence Day (Georgia)|Independence Day]], the anniversary of the formation of the republic in 1918, together with elements from:\n\n* [[National Police of Georgia]]\n* [[Border Police of Georgia]]\n* [[Georgian Coast Guard]]\n\nModern parades are a mix of the former Soviet and modern Western (British, US, Turkish and Israeli) traditions and drill owing to the modernization of the defense and public security forces to NATO and EU standards.\n\n===== Kazakhstan =====\nThe [[Armed Forces of Kazakhstan]] holds military parades ({{Lang-kk|\u04d8\u0441\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434}}) that resemble the parades of the Russian military in [[Moscow]], with one of the only exceptions being the inspection of the troops by the [[President of Kazakhstan|Supreme Commander of the Kazakh Armed Forces]], instead of the defense minister. It has never held yearly parades celebrating one occasion, with parades currently being held in honor of the [[Defender of the Fatherland Day (Kazakhstan)|Defender of the Fatherland Day]] holiday. In the past, large scale military parades in the former capital of [[Almaty]] and the current capital of [[Nur-Sultan]] were held on the following holidays:\n\n*[[Kazakhstan Independence Day]] (1996)\n*[[Victory Day (9 May)]] (1995, 2015)\n*[[Constitution Day (Kazakhstan)]] (2009, 2010, 2011)\n\nIn recent years, the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade was expanded to function as a so-called \"Battle Parade\" (\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434).

These parades usually are held at the 40th [[Otar Military Base]] in the [[Korday District]] and take place with the troops in full combat gear rather than a ceremonial [[full dress uniform]]. Like former Soviet republics, Kazakh military parades are led by a cadet [[Corps of drums|drum corps]], specifically from the [[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]].\n\n===== Kyrgyzstan =====\nKyrgyz military parades are based on Russian traditions, having been held on many different occasions in the history of the [[Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan]]. Currently, the only consistent military parade is held on [[Ala-Too Square]] in [[Bishkek]] every 5 years in honor of the country's [[Independence Day (Kyrgyzstan)|Independence Day]].

Since 2014, military bands have also played an integral part in these parades by marching with their units as part of the parade. Unlike their other counterparts, who use ''Hello Comrades'' as the official greeting during parades, Ukraine uses ''[[Glory to Ukraine]]'' as the official holiday greeting, with the troops responding by saying ''Glory to the Heroes''.<ref>{{cite web|title=President: The words \"Glory to Ukraine!

These are not considered to be regular military parades however, as the parading formations are actually not entirely composed of armed servicemen. The first known organized military procession in the [[United States]] was the [[Grand Review of the Armies]], on May 23 and May 24, 1865, following the end of the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865). The [[New York City Victory Parade of 1946]] was held in mid-January in 1946 to commemorate the conclusion of [[World War II]] and the Allied victory over the Axis Powers in all theaters of the war, helped by the service of millions of Americans who served under the armed forces and the National Guard, in addition to the state defense forces. In the late 40s and the early 50s, massive parades in honor of Army Day and later Armed Forces Day were held in the capital.<ref>https://networks.h-net.org/node/28441/discussions/1341907/washington-loves-parade</ref> The most recently held military parade was the [[National Victory Celebration]] on June 8, 1991, to celebrate the conclusion of [[Gulf War]] in [[Iraq]].

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.<ref name=\"DSB_Final_Report\"/> Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the airplane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash.

The club was founded on 10 April 1937 and currently plays in [[Ligue 1]], the first level of [[Football in France|French football]]. The club's most important achievements were winning [[Ligue 2]] in 1950 and the [[Championnat National]] in 1997 and in 2012. N\u00eemes plays its home matches at the [[Stade des Costi\u00e8res]] located within the city. The team is managed by [[Bernard Blaquart]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|N\u00eemes Olympique in European football}}\nThe Sporting Club N\u00eemois (SCN) was founded in 1901 by Henri Monnier, who, at the age of 21, had just returned from a two-year trip to England. He decided to start a new team in [[N\u00eemes]], his home town. Originally, the team was for young Protestants only.\n\nIn 1908, the SCN played [[Olympique Cettois|FC S\u00e8te]] for the title of 'Champions of [[Languedoc]]'. N\u00eemes won, qualifying for the final phase of the French championship, which they lost to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in the first round.\n\nThe club suspended activities due to [[World War I]]. After the war ended, it resumed its activities on 15 April 1919. In 1922, SCN united with another club from N\u00eemes, F.A. N\u00eemois, becoming a single club.\n\nThe new team, still under the name of Sporting Club N\u00eemois, was runner-up in the South-East championship in 1925. In 1927, ''les N\u00eemois'' won a place in the highest championship, then known as the Division d'Honneur.\n\nIn October 1931, the then-president of the Republic of France, [[Gaston Doumergue]], inaugurated the Jean Bouin stadium. \n\nDue to financial problems, SCN abandoned their professional activities in 1937. Following efforts from local businessmen, the club moved to the district of Loz\u00e8re-Gard in N\u00eemes, and was reformed as N\u00eemes Olympique. \n\nThe team moved to the [[Stade des Costi\u00e8res]] on 15 February 1989. The first league match at the stadium was on 4 March 1989, against Montceau in a [[Ligue 2]] game, with 3,647 spectators in attendance. The record attendance to date was 25,051, which was recorded in the 1991\u201392 season, in a [[Ligue 1]] game against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].\n\nIn December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, [[Eric Cantona]] threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the French Football Federation and was banned for one month. In turn, Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee and calling them idiots. His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from international football on 16 December 1991. \n\nIn 1995\u20131996, N\u00eemes reached the final of the [[French Cup]], allowing them to compete the following year in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]. In September 1996, in the Round of 32, N\u00eemes beat [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] (4\u20131 on aggregate), before losing to [[AIK Stockholm]] in the next round (2-3 on aggregate).\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Nimes secured promotion back to [[Ligue 1]] for the first time since the 1992\u20131993 season after finishing second in Ligue 2.<ref>http://www.ligue1.com/ligue2/article/nimes-clinch-promotion.htm</ref> In the 2018/2019 season, Nimes enjoyed a happy return to [[Ligue 1]] finishing 9th on the table.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.midilibre.fr/2019/05/24/football-nimes-lyon-le-match-en-direct,8218752.php/|title=Football : N\u00eemes conclut sa saison par une d\u00e9faite face \u00e0 Lyon aux Costi\u00e8res (2-3)|website=www.midilibre.fr}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Updated|31 January 2020.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimes-olympique.com/equipe-pro/effectif/ |title=Effectif |publisher=nimes-olympique.com|accessdate=1 March 2018|language=French}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}} \n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=FRA|name=[[Pablo Martinez (French footballer)|Pablo Martinez]]|pos=DF|other=on loan from [[RC Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=FRA|name=[[Lo\u00efck Landre]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=SEN|name=[[Sidy Sarr]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=FRA|name=[[Romain Philippoteaux]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=FRA|name=[[Lucas Deaux]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=FRA|name=[[Cl\u00e9ment Depres]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=ALG|name=[[Zinedine Ferhat]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=MKD|name=[[Vlatko Stojanovski]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=FRA|name=[[Lamine Fomba]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=FRA|name=[[Antoine Val\u00e9rio]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=FRA|name=[[Ga\u00ebtan Paquiez]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=FRA|name=[[Lucas Dias (footballer, born 1999)|Lucas Dias]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=BIH|name=[[Haris Duljevi\u0107]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=FRA|name=[[Theo Valls]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=FRA|name=[[Lucas Buad\u00e9s]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=FRA|name=[[Renaud Ripart]]|pos=FW|other=[[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=FRA|name=[[Kelyan Guessoum]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=MAR|name=[[Yassine Benrahou]]|pos=MF|other=on loan from [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=FRA|name=[[Anthony Brian\u00e7on]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=MAR|name=[[Sami Ben Amar]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=FRA|name=[[Nolan Roux]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=FRA|name=[[Florian Miguel]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=TOG|name=[[K\u00e9vin Denkey]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=SEN|name=[[Moussa Kon\u00e9 (footballer, born 1996)|Moussa Kon\u00e9]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=29|nat=FRA|name=[[Sofiane Alakouch]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=FRA|name=[[Paul Bernardoni]]|pos=GK|other=on loan from [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Reserve squad===\n''As of 4 November 2019''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimes-olympique.com/equipe-amateurs/centre-de-formation/cfa-2/national3/|title =SAISON 2018-2019 NATIONAL 2|publisher=nimes-olympique.com||accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=GK|name=C\u00f4me Charrier}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=GK|name=[[Valentin Rabouille]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Alexandre Ferreira}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=J\u00e9r\u00e9my Iafrate}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Enzo Fontanelli}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Mat\u00e9o Maillefaud}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Julien Megier}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Micka\u00ebl Gas}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Kl\u00e9ri Serber}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Matt\u00e9o Ahlinvi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Simon Calancha}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Nacim El Hassani}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Quentin Gregorio}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Luca Valls}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Axel Urie}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Timothy Cardona}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Hugo Huriez}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Houssine Labiad}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= \u2014|nat=FRA|name=[[Th\u00e9o Sainte-Luce]]|pos=DF|other=on loan to [[Gaz\u00e9lec Ajaccio|Gaz\u00e9lec]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Notable players===\nBelow are the notable former players who have represented N\u00eemes in [[Ligue 1|league]] and international competition since the club's foundation in 1937.

The club was founded on 10 April 1937 and currently plays in [[Ligue 1]], the first level of [[Football in France|French football]]. The club's most important achievements were winning [[Ligue 2]] in 1950 and the [[Championnat National]] in 1997 and in 2012. N\u00eemes plays its home matches at the [[Stade des Costi\u00e8res]] located within the city. The team is managed by [[Bernard Blaquart]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|N\u00eemes Olympique in European football}}\nThe Sporting Club N\u00eemois (SCN) was founded in 1901 by Henri Monnier, who, at the age of 21, had just returned from a two-year trip to England. He decided to start a new team in [[N\u00eemes]], his home town. Originally, the team was for young Protestants only.\n\nIn 1908, the SCN played [[Olympique Cettois|FC S\u00e8te]] for the title of 'Champions of [[Languedoc]]'. N\u00eemes won, qualifying for the final phase of the French championship, which they lost to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in the first round.\n\nThe club suspended activities due to [[World War I]]. After the war ended, it resumed its activities on 15 April 1919. In 1922, SCN united with another club from N\u00eemes, F.A. N\u00eemois, becoming a single club.\n\nThe new team, still under the name of Sporting Club N\u00eemois, was runner-up in the South-East championship in 1925. In 1927, ''les N\u00eemois'' won a place in the highest championship, then known as the Division d'Honneur.\n\nIn October 1931, the then-president of the Republic of France, [[Gaston Doumergue]], inaugurated the Jean Bouin stadium. \n\nDue to financial problems, SCN abandoned their professional activities in 1937. Following efforts from local businessmen, the club moved to the district of Loz\u00e8re-Gard in N\u00eemes, and was reformed as N\u00eemes Olympique. \n\nThe team moved to the [[Stade des Costi\u00e8res]] on 15 February 1989. The first league match at the stadium was on 4 March 1989, against Montceau in a [[Ligue 2]] game, with 3,647 spectators in attendance. The record attendance to date was 25,051, which was recorded in the 1991\u201392 season, in a [[Ligue 1]] game against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].\n\nIn December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, [[Eric Cantona]] threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the French Football Federation and was banned for one month. In turn, Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee and calling them idiots. His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from international football on 16 December 1991. \n\nIn 1995\u20131996, N\u00eemes reached the final of the [[French Cup]], allowing them to compete the following year in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]. In September 1996, in the Round of 32, N\u00eemes beat [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] (4\u20131 on aggregate), before losing to [[AIK Stockholm]] in the next round (2-3 on aggregate).\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Nimes secured promotion back to [[Ligue 1]] for the first time since the 1992\u20131993 season after finishing second in Ligue 2.<ref>http://www.ligue1.com/ligue2/article/nimes-clinch-promotion.htm</ref> In the 2018/2019 season, Nimes enjoyed a happy return to [[Ligue 1]] finishing 9th on the table.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.midilibre.fr/2019/05/24/football-nimes-lyon-le-match-en-direct,8218752.php/|title=Football : N\u00eemes conclut sa saison par une d\u00e9faite face \u00e0 Lyon aux Costi\u00e8res (2-3)|website=www.midilibre.fr}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Updated|31 January 2020.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimes-olympique.com/equipe-pro/effectif/ |title=Effectif |publisher=nimes-olympique.com|accessdate=1 March 2018|language=French}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}} \n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=FRA|name=[[Pablo Martinez (French footballer)|Pablo Martinez]]|pos=DF|other=on loan from [[RC Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=FRA|name=[[Lo\u00efck Landre]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=SEN|name=[[Sidy Sarr]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=FRA|name=[[Romain Philippoteaux]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=FRA|name=[[Lucas Deaux]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=FRA|name=[[Cl\u00e9ment Depres]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=ALG|name=[[Zinedine Ferhat]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=MKD|name=[[Vlatko Stojanovski]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=FRA|name=[[Lamine Fomba]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=FRA|name=[[Antoine Val\u00e9rio]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=FRA|name=[[Ga\u00ebtan Paquiez]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=FRA|name=[[Lucas Dias (footballer, born 1999)|Lucas Dias]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=BIH|name=[[Haris Duljevi\u0107]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=FRA|name=[[Theo Valls]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=FRA|name=[[Lucas Buad\u00e9s]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=FRA|name=[[Renaud Ripart]]|pos=FW|other=[[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=FRA|name=[[Kelyan Guessoum]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=MAR|name=[[Yassine Benrahou]]|pos=MF|other=on loan from [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=FRA|name=[[Anthony Brian\u00e7on]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=MAR|name=[[Sami Ben Amar]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=FRA|name=[[Nolan Roux]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=FRA|name=[[Florian Miguel]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=TOG|name=[[K\u00e9vin Denkey]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=SEN|name=[[Moussa Kon\u00e9 (footballer, born 1996)|Moussa Kon\u00e9]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=29|nat=FRA|name=[[Sofiane Alakouch]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=FRA|name=[[Paul Bernardoni]]|pos=GK|other=on loan from [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Reserve squad===\n''As of 4 November 2019''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimes-olympique.com/equipe-amateurs/centre-de-formation/cfa-2/national3/|title =SAISON 2018-2019 NATIONAL 2|publisher=nimes-olympique.com||accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=GK|name=C\u00f4me Charrier}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=GK|name=[[Valentin Rabouille]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Alexandre Ferreira}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=J\u00e9r\u00e9my Iafrate}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Enzo Fontanelli}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Mat\u00e9o Maillefaud}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Julien Megier}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Micka\u00ebl Gas}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Kl\u00e9ri Serber}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Matt\u00e9o Ahlinvi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Simon Calancha}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Nacim El Hassani}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Quentin Gregorio}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Luca Valls}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Axel Urie}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Timothy Cardona}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Hugo Huriez}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Houssine Labiad}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= \u2014|nat=FRA|name=[[Th\u00e9o Sainte-Luce]]|pos=DF|other=on loan to [[Gaz\u00e9lec Ajaccio|Gaz\u00e9lec]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Notable players===\nBelow are the notable former players who have represented N\u00eemes in [[Ligue 1|league]] and international competition since the club's foundation in 1937.

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

It heckled politicians, held demonstrations and marches, broke the law to force arrests, broke windows in prominent buildings, set fire to post boxes, committed night-time arson of unoccupied houses and churches, and\u2014when imprisoned\u2014went on [[hunger strike]] and endured [[force-feeding]].\n\n==Early years==\nThe Women's Social and Political Union was founded as an independent women's movement on 10 October 1903 at 62 Nelson Street, [[Manchester]], home of the Pankhurst family.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Purvis | first=June | author-link=June Purvis|title=Emmeline Pankhurst: A Biography | publisher=Routledge | location=London|year=2002|page=67|isbn=978-0-415-23978-3|ref=harv}}</ref> [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], along with two of her daughters, [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]] and [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Sylvia]], and her husband, [[Richard Pankhurst|Richard]], before his death in 1898, had been active in the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), founded in 1893 by former Scottish miner [[Keir Hardie]], a family friend.<ref name=Purvis1996p260/> (Hardie later founded the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].)\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst had increasingly felt that the ILP was not there for women.<ref name=Purvis1996p260>{{cite journal |first=June|last=Purvis|year=1996 |title=A 'pair of \u2026 infernal queens'?

The WSPU changed tactics following the failure of the bill; they focused on attacking whichever [[political party]] was in government and refused to support any legislation which did not include [[enfranchisement]] for women. This translated into abandoning their initial commitment to also supporting immediate social reforms.<ref name=\"Davis\">Mary Davis, ''Sylvia Pankhurst'' (Pluto Press, 1999) {{ISBN|0-7453-1518-6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, the group began a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and lobbies of Parliament, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of growing numbers of their members. An attempt to achieve equal franchise gained national attention when an envoy of 300 women, representing over 125,000&nbsp;suffragettes, argued for women's suffrage with the Prime Minister, Sir&nbsp;[[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. The Prime Minister agreed with their argument but \"was obliged to do nothing at all about it\" and so urged the women to \"go on pestering\" and to exercise \"the virtue of patience\".<ref name=\"Strachey\">Strachey, Ray (1928).

The Pethick Lawrences, who were part of the leadership of the WSPU until 1912, edited the newspaper and supported it financially in the early years.\n\nIn 1908 the WSPU adopted purple, white, and green as its official colours.

The government later passed the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act&nbsp;1913]] (more commonly known as the \"Cat and Mouse Act\"), which allowed the release of suffragettes who were close to death due to malnourishment. Officers, however, could re-imprison them again once they were healthy. This was an attempt to avoid [[force-feeding]].<ref name=\"Davis\" /> In response, the WSPU organised an all-women security team known as the Bodyguard, trained in ju-jitsu by [[Edith Margaret Garrud]] and led by [[Gertrude Harding]], whose role was to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-imprisonment.<ref>Rouse, Wendy Her Own Hero: The Origins of the Women's Self-Defense Movement.

Initially this involved smashing shop windows, but ultimately escalated to burning [[stately home]]s and bombing public buildings including [[Westminster Abbey]].  A special medal, the [[Hunger Strike Medal]], like a military honour was designed by Sylvia Pankhurst and awarded 'for Valour' to women who had been on hunger strke/force-fed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womanandhersphere.com/2012/08/11/collecting-suffrage-the-hunger-strike-medal/|title=Collecting Suffrage: The Hunger Strike Medal|date=2012-08-11|website=Woman and her Sphere|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The increasing militancy also famously led to the death of IDK [[Emily Davison]] as she was trampled by the King's horse, Anmer, (over which she was attempting to drape a suffragette banner) at [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] in 1913.\n\n[[File:WSPU in Kingsway.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The WSPU in Kingsway, c. 1911]]\nIncluded in the many militant acts performed were the night-time arson of unoccupied houses (including that of Chancellor of the Exchequer [[David Lloyd George]]) and churches. Suffragettes smashed windows of upscale shops and government offices. They cut telephone lines, spat at police and politicians, cut or burned pro-suffrage slogans into stadium turf,<ref name=Spartacus/> sent letter bombs, destroyed greenhouses at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew gardens]], chained themselves to railings and blew up houses. A doctor was attacked with a rhino whip, and in one case suffragettes rushed the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. On 18&nbsp;July&nbsp;1912 [[Mary Leigh]] threw a hatchet at Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]].\n\nOn the evening of 9 March 1914, about 40 militant suffragettes, including members of the Bodyguard team, brawled with several squads of police constables who were attempting to re-arrest Emmeline Pankhurst during a pro-suffrage rally at St. Andrew's Hall in [[Glasgow]]. The following day, suffragette [[Mary Richardson]] (known as one of the most militant activists, also called \"Slasher\" Richardson) walked into the National Gallery and attacked [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s painting, [[Rokeby Venus]] with a meat cleaver. In 1913 suffragette militancy caused \u00a354,000 worth of damage, \u00a336,000 of which occurred in April alone.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe organisation also suffered divisions. The editors of ''Votes for Women'', Frederick and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence, were expelled in 1912, later founding the [[United Suffragists]].  This caused the WSPU to launch a new journal, '''''The Suffragette''''', edited by Christabel Pankhurst. The [[East London Federation of Suffragettes|East London Federation]] of mostly [[working-class]] women and led by [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was expelled in 1914.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n==During the First World War==\nOn the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, Christabel Pankhurst was living in Paris, in order to run the organisation without fear of arrest.

The WSPU stopped publishing ''The Suffragette'', and in April&nbsp;1915 it launched a new journal, ''Britannia''. While the majority of WSPU members supported the war, a small number formed the Suffragettes of the Women's Social Political Union (SWSPU) and the [[Independent Women's Social and Political Union]] (IWSPU). The WSPU faded from public attention and was dissolved in 1917, with Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst founding the [[Women's Party (UK)|Women's Party]].<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n== Suffrage drama ==\nBetween 1905 and 1914 [[suffrage drama]] and theatre forums became increasingly utilised by the women's movement. Around this same time, however, the WSPU also became increasingly associated with militancy, moving from marches, demonstrations, and other public performances to more avant-garde and inflammatory \u201cacts of violence.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tilghman|first=Carolyn|date=2011|title=Staging Suffrage: Women, Politics, and the Edwardian Theater|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=45|issue=4|pages=339\u2013360|doi=10.1353/cdr.2011.0031|issn=1936-1637}}</ref> The organisation began using these shock tactics to demonstrate the seriousness and urgency of the cause. Their demonstrations included \u201cwindow smashing, museum-painting slashing, arson, fuse box bombing, and telegraph line cutting,\u201d\u2014suffrage playwrights, in turn, began using their work to combat the negative press around the movement and attempted to demonstrate in performance how these acts of violence only occur as a last resort. They attempted to transform the negative, yet popular perspective of these militant acts as being the actions of irrational, hysterical, \u2018overly-emotional\u2019 women and instead demonstrate how these protests were merely the only logical response to being denied a basic fundamental right.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Suffragette]]s not only used theatre to their advantage, but they also employed the use of comedy. The Women's Social and Political Union was one of the first organisations to capitalise on comedic satirical writing and use it to outwit their opposition.

Known from 1906 as the [[suffragette]]s, its membership and policies were tightly controlled by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her daughters [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]] and [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Sylvia]] (although Sylvia was eventually expelled).\n\nThe WSPU membership became known for [[civil disobedience]] and [[direct action]]. It heckled politicians, held demonstrations and marches, broke the law to force arrests, broke windows in prominent buildings, set fire to post boxes, committed night-time arson of unoccupied houses and churches, and\u2014when imprisoned\u2014went on [[hunger strike]] and endured [[force-feeding]].\n\n==Early years==\nThe Women's Social and Political Union was founded as an independent women's movement on 10 October 1903 at 62 Nelson Street, [[Manchester]], home of the Pankhurst family.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Purvis | first=June | author-link=June Purvis|title=Emmeline Pankhurst: A Biography | publisher=Routledge | location=London|year=2002|page=67|isbn=978-0-415-23978-3|ref=harv}}</ref> [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], along with two of her daughters, [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]] and [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Sylvia]], and her husband, [[Richard Pankhurst|Richard]], before his death in 1898, had been active in the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), founded in 1893 by former Scottish miner [[Keir Hardie]], a family friend.<ref name=Purvis1996p260/> (Hardie later founded the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].)\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst had increasingly felt that the ILP was not there for women.<ref name=Purvis1996p260>{{cite journal |first=June|last=Purvis|year=1996 |title=A 'pair of \u2026 infernal queens'?

The WSPU changed tactics following the failure of the bill; they focused on attacking whichever [[political party]] was in government and refused to support any legislation which did not include [[enfranchisement]] for women. This translated into abandoning their initial commitment to also supporting immediate social reforms.<ref name=\"Davis\">Mary Davis, ''Sylvia Pankhurst'' (Pluto Press, 1999) {{ISBN|0-7453-1518-6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, the group began a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and lobbies of Parliament, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of growing numbers of their members. An attempt to achieve equal franchise gained national attention when an envoy of 300 women, representing over 125,000&nbsp;suffragettes, argued for women's suffrage with the Prime Minister, Sir&nbsp;[[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. The Prime Minister agreed with their argument but \"was obliged to do nothing at all about it\" and so urged the women to \"go on pestering\" and to exercise \"the virtue of patience\".<ref name=\"Strachey\">Strachey, Ray (1928).

His thoughtless words infuriated the protesters and \"by those foolish words the militant movement became irrevocably established, and the stage of revolt began\".<ref name=\"Strachey\"/> In 1907, the organisation held the first of several of their \"Women's Parliaments\".<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] then voted to support [[universal suffrage]]. This split them from the WSPU, which had always accepted the property qualifications which already applied to women's participation in local elections. Under Christabel's direction, the group began to more explicitly organise exclusively among [[middle-class]] women, and stated their opposition to all political parties. This led a small group of prominent members to leave and form the [[Women's Freedom League]].<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n==Campaigning develops==\n[[File:Suffragettes, England, 1908.JPG|thumb|left|WSPU meeting, c. 1908.

The Pethick Lawrences, who were part of the leadership of the WSPU until 1912, edited the newspaper and supported it financially in the early years.\n\nIn 1908 the WSPU adopted purple, white, and green as its official colours. These colours were chosen by Emmeline Pethick Lawrence because \"Purple...stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette...white stands for purity in private and public life...green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring\".<ref name=\"fairhall\">Quotation from the journal ''Votes for Women'' in 1908 cited by David Fairhall, ''Common Ground'', Tauris, 2006 p 31.</ref> June&nbsp;1908 saw the first major public use of these colours when the WSPU held a 300,000-strong \"[[Women's Sunday]]\" [[Demonstration (people)|rally]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].\n\nIn February&nbsp;1907 the WSPU founded the Woman's Press, which oversaw publishing and propaganda for the organisation, and marketed a range of products from 1908 featuring the WSPU's name or colours.

The government later passed the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act&nbsp;1913]] (more commonly known as the \"Cat and Mouse Act\"), which allowed the release of suffragettes who were close to death due to malnourishment. Officers, however, could re-imprison them again once they were healthy. This was an attempt to avoid [[force-feeding]].<ref name=\"Davis\" /> In response, the WSPU organised an all-women security team known as the Bodyguard, trained by [[Edith Margaret Garrud]] and led by [[Gertrude Harding]], whose role was to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-imprisonment. The WSPU also coordinated a campaign in which doctors such as [[Flora Murray]] and [[Elizabeth Gould Bell]] treated the imprisoned suffragettes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/elizabeth-gould-bell-feminist-trailblazer-whose-life-was-sadly-blighted-by-family-tragedies-1-8598455|title=Elizabeth Gould Bell: Feminist trailblazer whose life was sadly blighted by family tragedies|website=www.newsletter.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\nA new suffrage bill was introduced in 1910, but growing impatient, the WSPU launched a heightened campaign of protest in 1912 on the basis of targeting [[property]] and avoiding violence against any person. Initially this involved smashing shop windows, but ultimately escalated to burning [[stately home]]s and bombing public buildings including [[Westminster Abbey]].  A special medal, the [[Hunger Strike Medal]], like a military honour was designed by Sylvia Pankhurst and awarded 'for Valour' to women who had been on hunger strke/force-fed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womanandhersphere.com/2012/08/11/collecting-suffrage-the-hunger-strike-medal/|title=Collecting Suffrage: The Hunger Strike Medal|date=2012-08-11|website=Woman and her Sphere|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The increasing militancy also famously led to the death of IDK [[Emily Davison]] as she was trampled by the King's horse, Anmer, (over which she was attempting to drape a suffragette banner) at [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] in 1913.\n\n[[File:WSPU in Kingsway.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The WSPU in Kingsway, c. 1911]]\nIncluded in the many militant acts performed were the night-time arson of unoccupied houses (including that of Chancellor of the Exchequer [[David Lloyd George]]) and churches. Suffragettes smashed windows of upscale shops and government offices. They cut telephone lines, spat at police and politicians, cut or burned pro-suffrage slogans into stadium turf,<ref name=Spartacus/> sent letter bombs, destroyed greenhouses at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew gardens]], chained themselves to railings and blew up houses. A doctor was attacked with a rhino whip, and in one case suffragettes rushed the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. On 18&nbsp;July&nbsp;1912 [[Mary Leigh]] threw a hatchet at Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]].\n\nOn the evening of 9 March 1914, about 40 militant suffragettes, including members of the Bodyguard team, brawled with several squads of police constables who were attempting to re-arrest Emmeline Pankhurst during a pro-suffrage rally at St. Andrew's Hall in [[Glasgow]]. The following day, suffragette [[Mary Richardson]] (known as one of the most militant activists, also called \"Slasher\" Richardson) walked into the National Gallery and attacked [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s painting, [[Rokeby Venus]] with a meat cleaver. In 1913 suffragette militancy caused \u00a354,000 worth of damage, \u00a336,000 of which occurred in April alone.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe organisation also suffered divisions. The editors of ''Votes for Women'', Frederick and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence, were expelled in 1912, later founding the [[United Suffragists]].  This caused the WSPU to launch a new journal, '''''The Suffragette''''', edited by Christabel Pankhurst. The [[East London Federation of Suffragettes|East London Federation]] of mostly [[working-class]] women and led by [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was expelled in 1914.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n==During the First World War==\nOn the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, Christabel Pankhurst was living in Paris, in order to run the organisation without fear of arrest.

The WSPU stopped publishing ''The Suffragette'', and in April&nbsp;1915 it launched a new journal, ''Britannia''. While the majority of WSPU members supported the war, a small number formed the Suffragettes of the Women's Social Political Union (SWSPU) and the [[Independent Women's Social and Political Union]] (IWSPU). The WSPU faded from public attention and was dissolved in 1917, with Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst founding the [[Women's Party (UK)|Women's Party]].<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n== Suffrage drama ==\nBetween 1905 and 1914 [[suffrage drama]] and theatre forums became increasingly utilised by the women's movement. Around this same time, however, the WSPU also became increasingly associated with militancy, moving from marches, demonstrations, and other public performances to more avant-garde and inflammatory \u201cacts of violence.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tilghman|first=Carolyn|date=2011|title=Staging Suffrage: Women, Politics, and the Edwardian Theater|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=45|issue=4|pages=339\u2013360|doi=10.1353/cdr.2011.0031|issn=1936-1637}}</ref> The organisation began using these shock tactics to demonstrate the seriousness and urgency of the cause.

The Women's Social and Political Union was one of the first organisations to capitalise on comedic satirical writing and use it to outwit their opposition.

{"title_page": "Agrarianism", "text_new": "{{short description|Political ideology supporting rural society}}\n'''Agrarianism''' is a [[social philosophy]] or [[political philosophy]] which relates to the ownership and use of land for farming, or relating to the part of a society or economy that is tied to agriculture. Agrarianism and Agrarians will typically advocate on behalf of farmers and those in rural communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agrarianism |title=Definition of agrarianism |last= |first= |date= |website=merriam-webster.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/agrarian |title=Definition of\u2004'agrarian' |last= |first= |date= |website=collinsdictionary.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> While there are many schools of thought within Agrarianism, historically a reoccurring feature of Agrarians has been a commitment to [[Egalitarianism]], with Agrarian political parties normally supporting the rights of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society.      \n\n== Philosophy ==\nSome scholars suggest that Agrarianism values rural society as superior to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values.<ref>Thompson, Paul. 2010. \u201cInterview Eighteen\u201d in Sustainability Ethics: 5 Questions Ed. Ryne Raffaelle, Wade Robinson, and Evan Selinger. United States: Automatic Press</ref> It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life. For example, [[M. Thomas Inge]] defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets:<ref>M. Thomas Inge, ed. ''Agrarianism in American Literature'' (1969), introduction; [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS/Yoeman/agri1.html paraphrased]</ref>\n*Farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self-sufficiency.\n*Urban life, capitalism, and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness.\n*The agricultural community, with its fellowship of labor and co-operation, is the model society.\n*The farmer has a solid, stable position in the world order. They have \"a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.\" The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society.\n*Cultivation of the soil \"has within it a positive spiritual good\" and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of \"honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality.\" They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of agrarianism}}\nThe philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of [[Agriculturalism]] (\u519c\u5bb6/\u8fb2\u5bb6) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian [[communalism]] and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by [[Confucianism]], the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon.<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite book |last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> That influenced European intellectuals like [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], an avid Confucianist and advocate of China's agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of [[physiocracy]].<ref>L.A. Maverick, \"Chinese Influences upon the Physiocrats,\" ''Economic History'', 3:54\u201367 (February 1938),</ref> The physiocrats, along with the ideas of [[John Locke]] and the [[Romantic Era]], formed the basis of modern European and American agrarianism.\n\n\n\n==Types of Agrarianism==\n===Jeffersonian democracy===\n{{Main|Jeffersonian democracy}}\n[[File:T Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale 1791 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]] and his supporters idealised farmers as the citizens that the American Republic should be formed around.]] \nThe United States president [[Thomas Jefferson]] was an agrarian who based his ideas about the budding American democracy around the notion that farmers are \u201cthe most valuable citizens\u201d and the truest [[Republicanism in the United States|republicans]].<ref>Thomas P. Govan, \"Agrarian and Agrarianism: A Study in the Use and Abuse of Words,\" ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 30#1  (Feb., 1964), pp. 35\u201347 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2205372 in JSTOR]</ref> Jefferson and his support base were committed to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], which saw as being in opposition to [[aristocracy]], opposition to [[corruption]], and priority on [[virtue]], examplified by the \"[[yeoman farmer]]\", \"[[Plantations in the American South|planters]]\", and the [[Plain Folk of the Old South|\"plain folk\"]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Gordon S. |author-link= |date= |title=The American Revolution: A History |url= |location= |publisher= |page=100 |isbn=}}</ref> While praising the rural farmfolk, the Jeffersonians felt that financiers, bankers and industrialists created \"cesspools of corruption\" in the cites and should thus were to be avoided.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick.  (1995) ch 5; Wallace Hettle, ''The Peculiar Democracy: Southern Democrats in Peace and Civil War'' (2001)  p. 15</ref>\n\nThe Jeffersonians sought to orientate the American economy more towards agriculture than industry. Part of their motive to do was Jefferson's fear that the over industrialisation of American would create a class of wage laborers who relied on their employers for income and sustenance. In turn, these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers. In order to counter this, Jefferson introduced, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, \"a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward\" as well as tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy.<ref>Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 26</ref> In 1811 Jefferson, writing to a friend, explained: ''These revenues will be levied entirely on the rich . ... The Rich alone use imported article, and on these alone the whole taxes of the General Government are levied. The poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the General Government, but on his salt.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Jefferson|title=The writings of Thomas Jefferson vol 13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW5XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42|year=1907|page=42}}</ref> \n\n===Agrarian socialism===\n{{Main|Agrarian socialism}}\nAgrarian Socialism is a form of Agrarianism that is [[Anti-Capitalist]] in nature and seeks to introduce [[Socialist]] economic systems in their stead. \n\n====Zapatismo====\n[[File:Emiliano Zapata4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emiliano Zapata]] fought in the Mexican Revolution in the name of the Mexican peasants and sought to introduce reforms such as land redistribution.]]\nNotable Agrarian Socialists include [[Emiliano Zapata]] who was a leading figure in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. As part of the [[Liberation Army of the South]], his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the Mexican peasants, whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes. Zapata published [[Plan of Ayala]], which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in Mexico as part of the revolution. Zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the Revolution, but his political ideas lived on in the form of [[Zapatismo]]. \n\nZapatismo would form the basis for [[Neozapatismo]], the ideology of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]. Known as ''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' or EZLN in Spanish, EZLN is a [[far-left]] [[libertarian socialist]] political and militant group that emerged in the state of [[Chiapas]] in southmost Mexico in 1994. EZLN and Neozapatismo, as explicit in their name, seek to revive the Agrarian Socialist movement of Zapata, but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community-level decision making. \n\n[[Subcommander Marcos]], a leading member of the movement, argues that the peoples' collective ownership of the land was and is the basis for all subsequent developments the movement sought to create:<blockquote>\n\u2026When the land became property of the peasants \u2026 when the land passed into the hands of those who work it \u2026 [This was] the starting point for advances in government, health, education, housing, nutrition, women\u2019s participation, trade, culture, communication, and information \u2026[it was] was recovering the means of production, in this case, the land, animals, and machines that were in the hands of large property owners.\u201d<ref>See ''The Zapatistas\u2019 Dignified Rage: Final Public Speeches of Subcommander Marcos''. Edited by Nick Henck. Translated by Henry Gales. (Chico: AK Press, 2018), pp. 81-82. </ref></blockquote>\n\n====Maoism====\n[[Maoism]], the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[ideology]] of [[Mao Zedong]] and his followers, places a heavy emphasis on the role of peasants in its goals. In contrast to other [[Marxism|Marxist]] schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers, Maoism sees the peasantry as key. Believing that \"[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Maoism saw the Chinese Peasantry as the prime source for a [[Vanguardism|Marxist vanguard]] because it possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref> During the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] made extensive use of peasants and rural bases in their military tactics, often eschewing the cities. \n\nFollowing the eventual victory of the Communist Party in both wars, the countryside and how it should be run remained a focus for Mao. In 1958 Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], a social and economic campaign which, amongst other things, altered many aspects of rural Chinese life. It introduced mandatory [[Collective farming]] and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as [[People's commune]]s. These communes, which consisted of 5,000 people on average, were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life. The communes were run as [[co-operative]]s where wages and money were replaced by work points. Peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as \"[[Right-wing politics|Rightists]]\" and \"[[Counter-revolutionary|Counter-Revolutionaries]]\". Leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible, and those who attempted it were subjected to \"party-orchestrated public [[struggle sessions]],\" which further jeopardized their survival.<ref>Thaxton, Ralph A. Jr (2008).

[[Cambridge University Press]]. p.&nbsp;3. {{ISBN|0-521-72230-6}}.</ref> These Public [[Struggle session|criticism sessions]] were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local officials and they often devolved into little more than public beatings. <ref>Thaxton 2008, p.&nbsp;212.</ref>\n\nOn the communes, experiments were conducted in order to find new methods of planting crops, efforts were made to construct new irrigation systems on a massive scale, and the communes were all encouraged to produce steel backyard furnaces as part of an effort to increase steel production. However, following the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], Mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into China, and thus engineers were often not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned. Similarly, the experimentation with the crops did not produce results. In addition to this the [[Four Pests Campaign]] was launched, in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion. This campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators.\n\nNone of these new systems was working, but local leaders did not dare to state this, instead, they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas. In many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas, and in turn, the Chinese State developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the Commune system.<ref name=hinton1984>{{Cite book  | last = Hinton | first = William  | authorlink = William H.

''Communism: A Very Short Introduction'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-19-955154-5}}. p. 32 \"Most estimates of the number of Chinese people who died range from 15 to 30 million.\"</ref> A combination of bad weather and the new, failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food. By 1962, the Great Leap Forward was declared to be at an end. \n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mao once again radically altered life in rural China with the launching of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. As a response to the Great Chinese Famine, the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]] began \"sending down\" urban youths to rural China in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities. However, Mao turned the practice into a political crusade, declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants. In reality, it was the Communist Party's attempt to reign in the [[Red Guards]], who had become uncontrollable during the course of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 10% of the 1970 urban population of China was sent out to remote rural villages, often in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The villages, which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the Great Chinese Famine, did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers. Furthermore, the so-called \"[[Sent-down youth]]\" had no agricultural experience and as a result, they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside, and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector. As a result, many of the sent-down youth died in the countryside. The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/up-to-the-mountains.php|title=Up to the mountains, down to the villages (1968)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nIn imitation of Mao's policies, the [[Khmer Rouge]] of [[Cambodia]] (who were heavily funded and supported by the People's Republic of China)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visiontimes.com/2018/01/28/how-red-china-supported-the-brutal-khmer-rouge.html |title=How Red China Supported the Brutal Khmer Rouge |last=Burke |first=James |date=28 January 2018 |website=VisionTimes.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> created their own version of the Great Leap Forward which was known as \"Maha Lout Ploh\".

Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted [[village cooperatives]] to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.\n\nPeasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.\n\n===Tunisia===\n\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.\n\n====Czechoslovakia====\nIn [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Sharon Werning Rivera, \"Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\" ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208.</ref>\n\n====France====\nIn [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the [[2002 French presidential election]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]].\n\n====Ireland====\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish [[landlordism]] in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The \"[[Land War]]\" of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers.\n\nPost-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.\n\n[[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.\n\n====Lithuania====\nIn Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]].\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined.\n\n====Romania====\nIn [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928\u20131930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996\u20132000.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.\n\n====Ukraine====\nIn Ukraine, the [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko]] has promised to purify the country of [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]] \"with a [[pitchfork]]\".<ref name=BBCUE14RPst>[http://www.bbc.com/nes/world-europe-29739514 Ukraine election: What to look for], [[BBC News]] (24 October 2014)</ref> The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (lower salary taxes, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village\n<ref name=radppUW>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/121957 The Communist Party May Be on Its Last Legs, But Social Populism is Still Alive], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 October 2014)</ref>), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0 |title=With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nHistorian F.K.

The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.<ref>Rae Wear, \"Countrymindedness Revisited,\" (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nThe [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called \"[[populism]].\" [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]].\n\nTo obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.<ref>James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346</ref><ref>Tom Brooking, \"'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&action=null online]</ref>\n\n== Back-to-the-land movement ==\nAgrarianism is similar to but not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]].

They have \"a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.\" The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society.\n*Cultivation of the soil \"has within it a positive spiritual good\" and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of \"honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality.\" They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of agrarianism}}\nThe philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of [[Agriculturalism]] (\u519c\u5bb6/\u8fb2\u5bb6) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian [[communalism]] and egalitarianism.

Part of their motive to do was Jefferson's fear that the over industrialisation of American would create a class of wage laborers who relied on their employers for income and sustenance. In turn, these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers. In order to counter this, Jefferson introduced, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, \"a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward\" as well as tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy.<ref>Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 26</ref> In 1811 Jefferson, writing to a friend, explained: ''These revenues will be levied entirely on the rich . ... The Rich alone use imported article, and on these alone the whole taxes of the General Government are levied. The poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the General Government, but on his salt.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Jefferson|title=The writings of Thomas Jefferson vol 13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW5XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42|year=1907|page=42}}</ref> \n\n===Agrarian socialism===\n{{Main|Agrarian socialism}}\nAgrarian Socialism is a form of Agrarianism that is [[Anti-Capitalist]] in nature and seeks to introduce [[Socialist]] economic systems in their stead. \n\n====Zapatismo====\n[[File:Emiliano Zapata4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emiliano Zapata]] fought in the Mexican Revolution in the name of the Mexican peasants and sought to introduce reforms such as land redistribution.]]\nNotable Agrarian Socialists include [[Emiliano Zapata]] who was a leading figure in the [[Mexican Revolution]].

Known as ''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' or EZLN in Spanish, EZLN is a [[far-left]] [[libertarian socialist]] political and militant group that emerged in the state of [[Chiapas]] in southmost Mexico in 1994. EZLN and Neozapatismo, as explicit in their name, seek to revive the Agrarian Socialist movement of Zapata, but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community-level decision making. \n\n[[Subcommander Marcos]], a leading member of the movement, argues that the peoples' collective ownership of the land was and is the basis for all subsequent developments the movement sought to create:<blockquote>\n\u2026When the land became property of the peasants \u2026 when the land passed into the hands of those who work it \u2026 [This was] the starting point for advances in government, health, education, housing, nutrition, women\u2019s participation, trade, culture, communication, and information \u2026[it was] was recovering the means of production, in this case, the land, animals, and machines that were in the hands of large property owners.\u201d<ref>See ''The Zapatistas\u2019 Dignified Rage: Final Public Speeches of Subcommander Marcos''.

In contrast to other [[Marxism|Marxist]] schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers, Maoism sees the peasantry as key. Believing that \"[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Maoism saw the Chinese Peasantry as the prime source for a [[Vanguardism|Marxist vanguard]] because it possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A.

''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref> During the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] made extensive use of peasants and rural bases in their military tactics, often eschewing the cities. \n\nFollowing the eventual victory of the Communist Party in both wars, the countryside and how it should be run remained a focus for Mao. In 1958 Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], a social and economic campaign which, amongst other things, altered many aspects of rural Chinese life. It introduced mandatory [[Collective farming]] and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as [[People's commune]]s. These communes, which consisted of 5,000 people on average, were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life. The communes were run as [[co-operative]]s where wages and money were replaced by work points. Peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as \"[[Right-wing politics|Rightists]]\" and \"[[Counter-revolutionary|Counter-Revolutionaries]]\". Leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible, and those who attempted it were subjected to \"party-orchestrated public [[struggle sessions]],\" which further jeopardized their survival.<ref>Thaxton, Ralph A. Jr (2008).

However, following the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], Mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into China, and thus engineers were often not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned. Similarly, the experimentation with the crops did not produce results. In addition to this the [[Four Pests Campaign]] was launched, in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion. This campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators.\n\nNone of these new systems was working, but local leaders did not dare to state this, instead, they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas. In many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas, and in turn, the Chinese State developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the Commune system.<ref name=hinton1984>{{Cite book  | last = Hinton | first = William  | authorlink = William H.

''Communism: A Very Short Introduction'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-19-955154-5}}. p. 32 \"Most estimates of the number of Chinese people who died range from 15 to 30 million.\"</ref> A combination of bad weather and the new, failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food. By 1962, the Great Leap Forward was declared to be at an end. \n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mao once again radically altered life in rural China with the launching of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. As a response to the Great Chinese Famine, the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]] began \"sending down\" urban youths to rural China in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities. However, Mao turned the practice into a political crusade, declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants. In reality, it was the Communist Party's attempt to reign in the [[Red Guards]], who had become uncontrollable during the course of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 10% of the 1970 urban population of China was sent out to remote rural villages, often in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The villages, which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the Great Chinese Famine, did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers. Furthermore, the so-called \"[[Sent-down youth]]\" had no agricultural experience and as a result, they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside, and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector. As a result, many of the sent-down youth died in the countryside. The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/up-to-the-mountains.php|title=Up to the mountains, down to the villages (1968)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nIn imitation of Mao's policies, the [[Khmer Rouge]] of [[Cambodia]] (who were heavily funded and supported by the People's Republic of China)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visiontimes.com/2018/01/28/how-red-china-supported-the-brutal-khmer-rouge.html |title=How Red China Supported the Brutal Khmer Rouge |last=Burke |first=James |date=28 January 2018 |website=VisionTimes.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> created their own version of the Great Leap Forward which was known as \"Maha Lout Ploh\".

Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted [[village cooperatives]] to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.\n\nPeasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.\n\n===Tunisia===\n\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.\n\n====Czechoslovakia====\nIn [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Sharon Werning Rivera, \"Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\" ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208.</ref>\n\n====France====\nIn [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the [[2002 French presidential election]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]].\n\n====Ireland====\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish [[landlordism]] in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The \"[[Land War]]\" of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers.\n\nPost-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.\n\n[[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.\n\n====Lithuania====\nIn Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]].\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined.\n\n====Romania====\nIn [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928\u20131930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996\u20132000.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.\n\n====Ukraine====\nIn Ukraine, the [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko]] has promised to purify the country of [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]] \"with a [[pitchfork]]\".<ref name=BBCUE14RPst>[http://www.bbc.com/nes/world-europe-29739514 Ukraine election: What to look for], [[BBC News]] (24 October 2014)</ref> The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (lower salary taxes, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village\n<ref name=radppUW>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/121957 The Communist Party May Be on Its Last Legs, But Social Populism is Still Alive], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 October 2014)</ref>), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0 |title=With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nHistorian F.K. Crowley finds that:\n: Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, as well as more healthy, more important and more productive, than life in the towns and cities....The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior.<ref>F.K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1901 \u2013 1939'' (1973) pp 77-78.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Party of Australia]] (formerly called the Country Party), from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called \"[[countrymindedness]]\".  The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.<ref>Rae Wear, \"Countrymindedness Revisited,\" (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nThe [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called \"[[populism]].\" [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]].\n\nTo obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.<ref>James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346</ref><ref>Tom Brooking, \"'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&action=null online]</ref>\n\n== Back-to-the-land movement ==\nAgrarianism is similar to but not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]]. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the \"progressive\" character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale.<ref>Jeffrey Carl Jacob, ''New Pioneers: The Back-to-the-Land Movement and the Search for a Sustainable Future'' (Penn State University Press. 1997)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Agropedia}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Agrarian Justice]]\n*[[Agrarian socialism]]\n*[[Agrarian society]]\n*[[Agrarian system]]\n*[[Georgism]]\n*[[Jeffersonian democracy]]\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Physiocrats]], 18th-century French thinkers\n*[[International Agrarian Bureau]]\n*[[Nordic agrarian parties]]\n*[[Yeoman]], English farmers\n*[[Permaculture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{further reading cleanup|date=April 2020}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n=== Agrarian values ===\n* Brass, Tom.
