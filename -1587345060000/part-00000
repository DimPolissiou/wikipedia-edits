It is located in the [[Lesser Himalaya]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|order=flip}}. It is noted for its [[tea]] industry, its views of [[Kangchenjunga]], the world's third-highest mountain, and the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Darjeeling is the headquarters of the [[Darjeeling district]] which has a partially autonomous status called [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] within the state of West Bengal. It is also a popular tourist destination in India.\n\nThe recorded history of the town starts from the early 19th century when the colonial administration under the [[British Raj]] set up a [[sanatorium]] and a military depot in the region. Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established in the region and tea growers developed hybrids of [[black tea]] and created new [[fermentation]] techniques. The resultant distinctive [[Darjeeling tea]] is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world.{{sfn|Srivastava|2003|p=4024}} The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway connects the town with the plains and has some of the few [[steam locomotive]]s still in service in [[India]].\n\nDarjeeling has several British-style [[Private school (India and Sri Lanka)|private schools]], which attract pupils from all over India and a few neighbouring countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]], Khampa, [[Indian Gorkha|Gorkha]], [[Newar]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Bhutia]], [[Bengalis|Bengali]]<ref name=\"Culture\"/> and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups.

Until the early 19th century, the hilly area around Darjeeling was controlled by the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]]{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=47\u201348}} with the settlement consisting of a few villages of the [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Kirati people]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}} The [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim had been engaged in unsuccessful warfare against the [[Gurkha]]s of Nepal.\n\nFrom 1780, the Gurkhas made several attempts to capture the entire region of Darjeeling. By the beginning of the 19th century, they had overrun Sikkim as far eastward as the [[Teesta River]] and had conquered and annexed the [[Terai]] and the entire area now belonged to Nepal.<ref>{{Cite book | title = 1922 Darjeeling Past and Present \u2013 A Concise History of Darjeeling District since 1835| year = 1922| last = Dozey| first = E.

The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] war broke out in 1814, which resulted in the defeat of the Gurkhas and subsequently led to the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty]] in 1816. According to the treaty, Nepal had to cede all those territories annexed from the Chogyal of Sikkim to the [[British East India Company]] (i.e. the area between [[Mechi River]] and Teesta River). Later in 1817, through the [[Treaty of Titalia]], the British East India Company reinstated the Chogyal of Sikkim, restored all the tracts of land between the River Mechi and the River Teesta to the Chogyal of Sikkim and guaranteed his sovereignty.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/>\n\nIn 1828, a delegation of the British [[East India Company]] (BEIC) officials on its way to the Nepal-Sikkim border stayed in Darjeeling and decided that the region was a suitable site for a sanatorium for British soldiers.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=50}}{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=69}} The company negotiated a lease of the area west of the [[Mahananda River]] from the Chogyal of Sikkim in 1835.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=47}} In 1849, the BEIC Superintendent [[Archibald Campbell (doctor)|Archibald Campbell]] and the explorer and botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] were imprisoned in the region by the Sikkim Chogyal. The BEIC sent a force to free them. Continued friction between the BEIC and the Sikkim authorities resulted in the annexation of {{convert|640|mi2|km2|order=flip}} of territory by the British in 1850. In 1864, the Bhutanese rulers and the British signed the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] that ceded the passes leading through the hills and [[Kalimpong]] to the British.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/> Further discord between Sikkim and the British resulted in a war, culminating in the signing of a treaty and the annexation by the British of the area east of the Teesta River in 1865.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=48}} By 1866, Darjeeling district had assumed its current shape and size, covering an area of {{convert|1234|mi2|km2|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/>\n[[File:Darjeeling_War_Memorial,_at_Batasia_Loop,_Darjeeling,.jpg|left|thumb|Darjeeling War Memorial |A view of the Darjeeling War Memorial, located at the [[Batasia Loop]] of the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]].

The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}} Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Lieutenant Robert Napier]] were responsible for establishing a hill station there.

A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, [[Kurseong]], Kalimpong and some parts of the Terai region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the [[Partition of India]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=55}} A cautious and non-receptive response by the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the [[Nepali language]]; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nThe creation of a new state of Sikkim in 1975, along with the reluctance of the Government of India to recognise Nepali as an official language under the [[Constitution of India]], brought the [[Gorkhaland movement]] to the forefront.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=62}} Agitation for a separate state continued through the 1980s,{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=63\u201364}} included violent protests during the 1986\u201388 period. The agitation ceased only after an agreement between the government and the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF), resulting in the establishment of an elected body in 1988 called the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]] (DGHC), which received autonomy to govern the district. Though Darjeeling became peaceful, the issue of a separate state lingered, fuelled in part by the lack of comprehensive economic development in the region even after the formation of the DGHC.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=65}} New protests erupted in 2008\u201309, but both the Union and State governments rejected [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]]'s (GJM) demand for a separate state.<ref name=\"NewProtest\">{{cite news| url = http://www.livemint.com/2009/07/14124608/Darjeeling-protests-hit-tea-an.html | title = Darjeeling protests hit tea and tourism |newspaper=[[Livemint]] | date =2009 | author =Dhar, S. | accessdate = 25 November 2009 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://archive.today/20121208142845/http://www.livemint.com/2009/07/14124608/Darjeeling-protests-hit-tea-an.html | archivedate = 8 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In July 2011, a pact was signed between GJM, the Government of West Bengal and the Government of India which includes the formation of a new autonomous, elected [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] (GTA), a hill council endowed with more powers than its predecessor Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council.<ref>{{cite news |title=Darjeeling tripartite pact signed for Gorkhaland Territorial Administration |author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Darjeeling-tripartite-pact-signed-for-Gorkhaland-Territorial-Administration/articleshow/9263963.cms |newspaper=Times of India |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=29 July 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120724010152/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Darjeeling-tripartite-pact-signed-for-Gorkhaland-Territorial-Administration/articleshow/9263963.cms |archivedate=24 July 2012  }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Mt.

It is located in the [[Lesser Himalaya]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|1|abbr=on}}. It is noted for its [[tea]] industry, its views of [[Kangchenjunga]], the world's third-highest mountain, and the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Darjeeling is the headquarters of the [[Darjeeling district]] which has a partially autonomous status called [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] within the state of West Bengal. It is also a popular tourist destination in India.\n\nThe recorded history of the town starts from the early 19th century when the colonial administration under the [[British Raj]] set up a [[sanatorium]] and a military depot in the region. Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established in the region and tea growers developed hybrids of [[black tea]] and created new [[fermentation]] techniques. The resultant distinctive [[Darjeeling tea]] is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world.{{sfn|Srivastava|2003|p=4024}} The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway connects the town with the plains and has some of the few [[steam locomotive]]s still in service in [[India]].\n\nDarjeeling has several British-style [[Private school (India and Sri Lanka)|private schools]], which attract pupils from all over India and a few neighbouring countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]], Khampa, [[Indian Gorkha|Gorkha]], [[Newar]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Bhutia]], [[Bengalis|Bengali]]<ref name=\"Culture\"/> and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups.

Until the early 19th century, the hilly area around Darjeeling was controlled by the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]]{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=47\u201348}} with the settlement consisting of a few villages of the [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Kirati people]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}} The [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim had been engaged in unsuccessful warfare against the [[Gurkha]]s of Nepal.\n\nFrom 1780, the Gurkhas made several attempts to capture the entire region of Darjeeling. By the beginning of the 19th century, they had overrun Sikkim as far eastward as the [[Teesta River]] and had conquered and annexed the [[Terai]] and the entire area now belonged to Nepal.<ref>{{Cite book | title = 1922 Darjeeling Past and Present \u2013 A Concise History of Darjeeling District since 1835| year = 1922| last = Dozey| first = E.

The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] war broke out in 1814, which resulted in the defeat of the Gurkhas and subsequently led to the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty]] in 1816. According to the treaty, Nepal had to cede all those territories annexed from the Chogyal of Sikkim to the [[British East India Company]] (i.e. the area between [[Mechi River]] and Teesta River). Later in 1817, through the [[Treaty of Titalia]], the British East India Company reinstated the Chogyal of Sikkim, restored all the tracts of land between the River Mechi and the River Teesta to the Chogyal of Sikkim and guaranteed his sovereignty.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/>\n\nIn 1828, a delegation of the British [[East India Company]] (BEIC) officials on its way to the Nepal-Sikkim border stayed in Darjeeling and decided that the region was a suitable site for a sanatorium for British soldiers.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=50}}{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=69}} The company negotiated a lease of the area west of the [[Mahananda River]] from the Chogyal of Sikkim in 1835.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=47}} In 1849, the BEIC Superintendent [[Archibald Campbell (doctor)|Archibald Campbell]] and the explorer and botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] were imprisoned in the region by the Sikkim Chogyal. The BEIC sent a force to free them. Continued friction between the BEIC and the Sikkim authorities resulted in the annexation of {{convert|640|mi2|km2}} of territory by the British in 1850. In 1864, the Bhutanese rulers and the British signed the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] that ceded the passes leading through the hills and [[Kalimpong]] to the British.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/> Further discord between Sikkim and the British resulted in a war, culminating in the signing of a treaty and the annexation by the British of the area east of the Teesta River in 1865.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=48}} By 1866, Darjeeling district had assumed its current shape and size, covering an area of {{convert|1234|mi2|km2}}.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/>\n[[File:Darjeeling_War_Memorial,_at_Batasia_Loop,_Darjeeling,.jpg|left|thumb|Darjeeling War Memorial |A view of the Darjeeling War Memorial, located at the [[Batasia Loop]] of the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]].

The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}} Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Lieutenant Robert Napier]] were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes and stimulate trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849.<ref name=\"HistoryOfDarjeeling\"/>{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}}{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850.{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} Commercial cultivation of tea in the district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=50}} Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the [[Bengal Presidency]] after 1864.{{sfn|Kenny|1995|p=700}} Scottish [[missionary|missionaries]] undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] in 1881 further hastened the development of the region.<ref name=\"UNESCO-MountainRailways\" /> In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major [[landslide]]s that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.{{sfn|Gerard|1990|p=258}}\n\n[[File:Darjeeling (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|Map of the station and its environs, ca 1914]]\nUnder the British Raj, the Darjeeling area was initially a \"Non-Regulation District\", a scheme of administration applicable to economically less advanced districts in the British India; acts and regulations of the British Raj did not automatically apply to the district in line with rest of the country.

A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, [[Kurseong]], Kalimpong and some parts of the Terai region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the [[Partition of India]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=55}} A cautious and non-receptive response by the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the [[Nepali language]]; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nThe creation of a new state of Sikkim in 1975, along with the reluctance of the Government of India to recognise Nepali as an official language under the [[Constitution of India]], brought the [[Gorkhaland movement]] to the forefront.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=62}} Agitation for a separate state continued through the 1980s,{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=63\u201364}} included violent protests during the 1986\u201388 period.

The soil is chiefly composed of [[sandstone]] and conglomerate formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range of [[Himalaya]]. However, the soil is often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose [[topsoil]], leading to frequent landslides during the [[monsoon]]s. According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]], (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes.<ref name=\"britannica\" />\n\n=== Climate

After leaving the band he moved to Brazil where he released two albums, achieving mainstream success. Following a brief subsequent stint in California, he returned to New York and joined the band [[Maggie's Dream]], which split after only one album, allowing him to resume his solo career. The singer and composer has released numerous albums, and has composed multiple songs for [[Ednita Nazario]], [[Julio Iglesias]] and former Menudo band-mate, [[Ricky Martin]]. He has also been featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''.\n\nRosa has been highly influenced by the works of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], [[The Doors]], [[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]], [[Horacio Quiroga]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Glenn Danzig]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Jim Morrison]].\n\nIn 1988, at age 18, he made his motion picture debut in the film ''[[Salsa (1988 film)|Salsa]]'', which was a big hit in Puerto Rico. During the filming of the movie, he met actress [[Angela Alvarado]] who would later become his wife.\n\nIn 1996, he released the Latino alternative rock album ''[[Vagabundo]]'' produced by [[Phil Manzanera]] before helping launch [[Ricky Martin]]'s musical career into a new global setting with ''[[Vuelve (album)|Vuelve]]''. Rosa wrote and produced various of Martin's hit singles including \"[[Mar\u00eda (Ricky Martin song)|Mar\u00eda]]\", \"[[Livin' la Vida Loca]]\", \"[[She's All I Ever Had]]\", \"[[The Cup of Life]]\", \"[[She Bangs]]\" and \"[[Shake Your Bon-Bon]]\", among others. Rosa toured with [[Lenny Kravitz]] during the summer of 2004 to promote his concept album ''[[Mad Love (Robi Draco Rosa album)|Mad Love]]''.\n\nIn April 2011, Rosa was diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancer near his liver. He underwent alternative and traditional treatment in [[Houston]] and [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]. This kept Rosa in a hiatus for almost a year until his return in March 2012, when he started recording his latest album with ''[[Vida (Draco Rosa album)|Vida]]'', and gave a concert with [[Juan Luis Guerra]] and [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] at the [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot Coliseum|Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot]].
