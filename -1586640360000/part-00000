The temple went through several rounds of rebuilding followed by re-destruction during the Mughal-[[Maratha]] conflict.

The temple was re-constructed by [[Maloji Bhosale]] of Verul, (grandfather of [[Shivaji]]) in the 16th century and later again by queen [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] in the 18th century.

Over 1000 Class 40s were constructed by [[Electroputere]] (EP) under [[ASEA]] license in EPs Craiova Works from 1967 to 1991.\n\nEntering service in 1965, the Class 40 also operated on private railroads after the repeal of CFRs monopoly on rail transport. The vast majority of all the engines are still in service, as of 2020, having become an icon for the Romanian Railways.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:CFR EA1 587 reversing a train in Gara de Nord.jpg|thumbnail|right|CFR Class 41-0587-0 reversing in Gara de Nord, with the new livery]]\nFollowing the plans of Communist Party, the Romanian railway network was to reduce its operating steam engines to under 25% of the total number of engines. Since the start of dieselisation in [[Romania]] and the electrification of the first railway sector between [[Bucharest]] and [[Bra\u0219ov]], communist ambitions were to improve local industrial capacities, remove dependency on outside sources and reduce conventional fuel consumption.<ref>[http://www.forumtrenuri.com/t1621-ceausescu-si-istoria-locomotivelor-realizate-la-electroputere Ceau\u0219escu \u0219i istoria locomotivelor realizate la \"Electroputere\"]</ref> Since Romania did not develop an [[electrical locomotive]] to suit these ambitions, foreign partnerships were searched to design and home build a working horse for the Romanian Railways. Even if Romania has previously signed partnerships with [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] for the development of its diesel-electric locomotives, for the electric locomotive a partnership was signed with Sweden's Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska (ASEA).\n\nBefore signing the contract with ASEA, trials were made on the [[Predeal]]-Brasov mainline between 1963 and 1965. The locomotives used were:\n* 2 locomotives of SNCF class BB 12000, made by [[Alstom]]\n* a locomotive made by [[LEW Hennigsdorf]], the predecessor of the [[DR Class E 251]]\n* 2 locomotives made by [[\u0160koda Works Plzen]], type 41E (this loco became the backbone of the Bulgarian Railways in 1963)\n* 2 locomotives made by ASEA type [[SJ Rb|Rb]] (these would also go to Yugoslavia in 1967 to be the basis of [[JZ class 441]])\n\n===Builders===\n[[File:Locomotiva CFR clasa 45.jpg|thumb|left|CFR Class 45]]\n\n====Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska AB====\n10 locomotives were made by ASEA after an agreement was reached in 1965. The locomotives were numbered from 060-EA-001 to 060-EA-009, and another unit, 060-EB-001 fitted with experimental electrical equipment ([[regenerative braking]] and thyristors) was delivered, though it was proven to be faulty and expensive to maintain and rarely used until 1991, when it was rebuilt into a regular 40 class unit. The 10 units were basically a SJ Rb but with heavy modifications (longer wheelbase, 6 axles), that were made until 1966. Out of all the 10 units that were delivered, only a few survive up to this day, 060-EA-001 being destroyed in an accident at [[Apa\u021ba]] in 1990, whilst a number of them have been renumbered/refurbished.<ref>[http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/special/ceausescu-si-istoria-locomotivelor-realizate-la-electroputere-502308.html# Ceau\u0219escu and Electroputere]  (in Romanian)</ref> At the time of their introduction, they were the second strongest class of electric locomotives in Europe, only being overtaken at this performance by the [[DB Class 103]] in West Germany.\n[[File:Szeged-Rendez\u0151 RO-RSCO 0400 739-5 2013-08-01 (2).JPEG|thumb|right|Train Hungary Class 400]]\n\n====Electroputere Craiova====\nAll the engines that were built after 1966 were built by the [[Electroputere]] [[Craiova]] factory and have been identified by the EA designation. These are all 6 axle, 5100&nbsp;kW engines, produced in a number of over 1000 units between 1967 and 1991. Electroputere (EP) manufactured both the mechanics and electronics of the engines, after mechanics for the engines stopped to be manufactured in Re\u0219i\u021ba, EP took care of the entire manufacturing for these engines and had a yearly output of 150 engines per year. The differences between EA class and EA1 class (classes 40 respectively 41 under the new classification) is that class EA is designed for regular passenger trains and freight trains, being limited to 120&nbsp;km/h whilst the class EA1 is designed for higher speed fast trains with a maximum speed of 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\n[[File:CFR 420 302 (formerly Class 42) at Bucuresti Nord.jpg|thumb|left|The only Class 42 ever built at Gara de Nord. It holds the speed record in Romania (227 km/h in 1997, on Flore\u0219ti Prahova - Buda line). Until soon it was capable of speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/H, but because one of the bearings is worn out, it can only achieve speeds of ~160&nbsp;km/h]]\n\nIn 1974, 060-EA1-122 (later 41-0122-6) was built using experimental 200&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios and used as a test locomotive under the classification of EA2 (thus becoming 060-EA2-122, nicknamed \"The General\" due to this high ranking status). After the experiments proved successful, the axles and gear ratios were transferred to 060-EA2-302 (later 42-0302-2, now 420 302 under the UIC classification) in 1977 and 122 was soon converted into an EA1 machine using 160&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios. 302 soon became the new \"general\", breaking the speed records for Romanian Railways twice, once in 1997 during testing of the Eurofima-based passenger cars on the Flore\u0219ti Prahova-Buda stretch of the Ploie\u0219ti-Bra\u0219ov mainline, and the second time in 2007 on the F\u0103urei ring during testing for Astra Arad passenger cars. In recent years it has been neglected and due to this, one of the bearings is damaged, resulting into the limitation of the speed to 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe design proved to be very successful, and after an agreement in 1970, [[Yugoslav Railways]] decided to buy a number of locomotives that became the J\u017d Series 461 from Electroputere, after CFR also agreed to buy Rade Koncar made locomotives. They were first delivered between 1971 and 1973, and they became so successful, that J\u017d brought a second batch between 1978 and 1980. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, they were passed onto [[Serbian Railways|\u017dS]], [[\u017deljezni\u010dki prevoz Crne Gore|\u017dCG]] and [[M\u017d]]. A number have been modernised, having been turned into 461.2 series (Serbia) and 462 series (Macedonia). Further exports were achieved in 1986 and 1987 when the [[Bulgarian State Railways]] brought another number of units, that were also modernized, becoming the 46.2 series (the original series number being 46). Modernization of these locomotives is done by [[Rade Kon\u010dar Zagreb]], [[REMARUL 16 Februarie Cluj]] and [[RELOC Craiova]].\n\nModernisations for the Romanian Railways' locomotives have been done by different companies, and the first of such concepts appeared in the late 1990s when Siemens (along with a few subcontractors) modernised a few units to [[CFR Class 45]]. The modernisations were a success and the locomotives were hailed as \"Romania's first modern electric locomotives\", produced between 1998 and 2002. Production was stopped though, and only a small number were made, all locomotives numbers beginning with 3xx. They were later rebuilt by Softronic Craiova, and up to this date only 1 unrefurbished locomotive (45-0318-1) runs in regular service, seen mostly on Bucharest-Constan\u021ba mainline. Starting with 2006 and 2007, a number of locomotives were rebuilt by Softronic and PROMAT as [[CFR Class 47]], being a more successful modernisation. Refurbishments are done by SCRL Bra\u0219ov, RELOC, INDA and Softronic Craiova, REMAR Pa\u0219cani and Cluj and PROMAT. From 2020 onwards, RELOC Craiova will begin to modernize more members of the classes, after SOFTRONIC quit modernizing locomotives into Class 47s in 2016.\n\nAside from the exported models to \u017dS and BD\u017d, these locomotives operate in Hungary and Slovakia. A number of examples are operated by [[Magyar Mag\u00e1nvas\u00fat Zrt.]], [[Train Hungary]], [[Prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Foxrail]] and [[Floyd Zrt.]], and are used in regular service in those countries. In 1998, [[Railways of Greece|OSE (Greek Railways)]] hired locomotive 060-EA-056 (manufactured 1968) to operate during the opening of the first electrified Greek railway line from [[Thessaloniki]] to [[Idomeni]]/[[Gevgelija]], and was temporarily used until it was returned to CFR.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe locomotive is known for its simplicity in operating - in the cab, original versions have a dashboard with a panel for gauges and switches, a throttle/[[dynamic brake]] wheel and brake levers, alongside with a knob for the horn, which has low/high and soft/hard tonnes and Hasler Bern [[speedometer]]s (mostly replaced by Softronic IVMS speedometers). Subsequently upgraded versions changed that, with the ICOL cabs featuring a throttle/dynamic brake lever, the dashboard is higher and features an on-board computer, and 2 buttons that remove the horn's ability to use the soft/hard tonnes. Certain modernizations (such as by PROMAT but in lower numbers) maintain the \"wheel\" but have a renovated dashboard, somewhat similar to the CFR Class 46.\n\nInside the machines' hall, electric current enters into the oil-cooled [[transformer]], where its converted from 25 kV AC to 1.5 kV, passing through silicon diode [[rectifier]]s where its converted into DC current for the ASEA LJE 108 [[traction motor]]s. There are also 3 ventilation groups that activate after 5 seconds each; the locomotive can start without the ventilators turned on, but only for shunting. Not using the ventilation on higher traction currents will lead to damage to the traction motors. The traction motors weigh 3,7 tonnes, and with all of them running properly, produce up to 5400kW of hourly power, and 5100kW continuous power. \n\nElectric current is obtained with the help of 2 [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]s and the main switch, type IAC-25. Early models till the mid-1970s had ASEA LLXJN 135 (with one skid plate for 120 km/h of maximum speed and with two skid plates for 160 km/h of maximum speed), but beginning with 1975, locomotives began to be delivered with Faiveley EP1 pantographs, which became a standard factory option from the late 1970s onwards. From the 1990s onwards, Faiveley EP2 and EP3 pantographs became more common, while on certain modernized examples (and for a brief period of time in the late 1990s for EA2 302), use Schunk WBLs, with some examples using Stemmann Technik DSA150s and Schunk WBL-Z (single arm) pantographs. EA1 292 was fitted with experimental Faiveley AX pantographs (typically fitted on SNCF [[SNCF Class BB 36000|Astride]] locomotives) between 1997 and 1998, in order to test them for the upcoming Class 45 modernization program. \n\nThe throttle and dynamic brake controller operates in a similar way to the [[BR Class 86]] tap charger mechanysm, with 40 throttle steps (including the 3 initial shunting positions), plus 3 weakfield positions, all displayed on a gauge. Dynamic braking is controlled in the same way as the throttle is, being activated by moving the wheel leftwards (as opposed to rightwards for throttle), with a limit of ~960A for its operation. All locomotives are fitted with standard dynamic braking, but between 1966 and 1991, one unit was fitted experimentally with [[regenerative braking]], however it was very ineconomical to operate, not to mention dangerous for the locomotive and the catenary. The unit, EB 001, was rebuilt and renumbered into EA 931. \n\n===Notable units===\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, multiple locomotives became easily recognizeable due to their liveries, which was in part, due to the drivers of these locomotives customizing them within the cab and outside. As such, it was common to see locomotives using window curtains, tricolor-painted stripes and various shades of the colors used by CFR at the time. Eventually this \"tradition\" died out when multiple locomotives were refurbished or scrapped, but some train drivers continued it in the 2000s and 2010s, including on modernized Class 47s. Certain locomotives also gained various nicknames, instead of a common nickname for the whole class. \n\n*EA 079 was made by Electroputere in 1979, and in the late 1990s it was refurbished by the same company in order to operate at 15 kV AC, for German railway operator [[Karsdorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft]] (this same operator purchased second-hand locomotives from Romania and the former East Germany). With its bankruptcy, it was stored for years in Germany, until ABB refurbished the locomotive in the mid 2010s in Sweden, looking for potential customers.

Over 1000 Class 40s were constructed by [[Electroputere]] (EP) under [[ASEA]] license in EPs Craiova Works from 1967 to 1991.\n\nEntering service in 1965, the Class 40 also operated on private railroads after the repeal of CFRs monopoly on rail transport. The vast majority of all the engines are still in service, as of 2020, having become an icon for the Romanian Railways.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:CFR EA1 587 reversing a train in Gara de Nord.jpg|thumbnail|right|CFR Class 41-0587-0 reversing in Gara de Nord, with the new livery]]\nFollowing the plans of Communist Party, the Romanian railway network was to reduce its operating steam engines to under 25% of the total number of engines. Since the start of dieselisation in [[Romania]] and the electrification of the first railway sector between [[Bucharest]] and [[Bra\u0219ov]], communist ambitions were to improve local industrial capacities, remove dependency on outside sources and reduce conventional fuel consumption.<ref>[http://www.forumtrenuri.com/t1621-ceausescu-si-istoria-locomotivelor-realizate-la-electroputere Ceau\u0219escu \u0219i istoria locomotivelor realizate la \"Electroputere\"]</ref> Since Romania did not develop an [[electrical locomotive]] to suit these ambitions, foreign partnerships were searched to design and home build a working horse for the Romanian Railways. Even if Romania has previously signed partnerships with [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] for the development of its diesel-electric locomotives, for the electric locomotive a partnership was signed with Sweden's Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska (ASEA).\n\nBefore signing the contract with ASEA, trials were made on the [[Predeal]]-Brasov mainline between 1963 and 1965. The locomotives used were:\n* 2 locomotives of SNCF class BB 12000, made by [[Alstom]]\n* a locomotive made by [[LEW Hennigsdorf]], the predecessor of the [[DR Class E 251]]\n* 2 locomotives made by [[\u0160koda Works Plzen]], type 41E (this loco became the backbone of the Bulgarian Railways in 1963)\n* 2 locomotives made by ASEA type [[SJ Rb|Rb]] (these would also go to Yugoslavia in 1967 to be the basis of [[JZ class 441]])\n\n===Builders===\n[[File:Locomotiva CFR clasa 45.jpg|thumb|left|CFR Class 45]]\n\n====Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska AB====\n10 locomotives were made by ASEA after an agreement was reached in 1965. The locomotives were numbered from 060-EA-001 to 060-EA-009, and another unit, 060-EB-001 fitted with experimental electrical equipment ([[regenerative braking]] and thyristors) was delivered, though it was proven to be faulty and expensive to maintain and rarely used until 1991, when it was rebuilt into a regular 40 class unit. The 10 units were basically a SJ Rb but with heavy modifications (longer wheelbase, 6 axles), that were made until 1966. Out of all the 10 units that were delivered, only a few survive up to this day, 060-EA-001 being destroyed in an accident at [[Apa\u021ba]] in 1990, whilst a number of them have been renumbered/refurbished.<ref>[http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/special/ceausescu-si-istoria-locomotivelor-realizate-la-electroputere-502308.html# Ceau\u0219escu and Electroputere]  (in Romanian)</ref> At the time of their introduction, they were the second strongest class of electric locomotives in Europe, only being overtaken at this performance by the [[DB Class 103]] in West Germany.\n[[File:Szeged-Rendez\u0151 RO-RSCO 0400 739-5 2013-08-01 (2).JPEG|thumb|right|Train Hungary Class 400]]\n\n====Electroputere Craiova====\nAll the engines that were built after 1966 were built by the [[Electroputere]] [[Craiova]] factory and have been identified by the EA designation. These are all 6 axle, 5100&nbsp;kW engines, produced in a number of over 1000 units between 1967 and 1991. Electroputere (EP) manufactured both the mechanics and electronics of the engines, after mechanics for the engines stopped to be manufactured in Re\u0219i\u021ba, EP took care of the entire manufacturing for these engines and had a yearly output of 150 engines per year. The differences between EA class and EA1 class (classes 40 respectively 41 under the new classification) is that class EA is designed for regular passenger trains and freight trains, being limited to 120&nbsp;km/h whilst the class EA1 is designed for higher speed fast trains with a maximum speed of 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\n[[File:CFR 420 302 (formerly Class 42) at Bucuresti Nord.jpg|thumb|left|The only Class 42 ever built at Gara de Nord. It holds the speed record in Romania (227 km/h in 1997, on Flore\u0219ti Prahova - Buda line). Until soon it was capable of speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/H, but because one of the bearings is worn out, it can only achieve speeds of ~160&nbsp;km/h]]\n\nIn 1974, 060-EA1-122 (later 41-0122-6) was built using experimental 200&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios and used as a test locomotive under the classification of EA2 (thus becoming 060-EA2-122, nicknamed \"The General\" due to this high ranking status). After the experiments proved successful, the axles and gear ratios were transferred to 060-EA2-302 (later 42-0302-2, now 420 302 under the UIC classification) in 1977 and 122 was soon converted into an EA1 machine using 160&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios. 302 soon became the new \"general\", breaking the speed records for Romanian Railways twice, once in 1997 during testing of the Eurofima-based passenger cars on the Flore\u0219ti Prahova-Buda stretch of the Ploie\u0219ti-Bra\u0219ov mainline, and the second time in 2007 on the F\u0103urei ring during testing for Astra Arad passenger cars. In recent years it has been neglected and due to this, one of the bearings is damaged, resulting into the limitation of the speed to 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe design proved to be very successful, and after an agreement in 1970, [[Yugoslav Railways]] decided to buy a number of locomotives that became the J\u017d Series 461 from Electroputere, after CFR also agreed to buy Rade Koncar made locomotives. They were first delivered between 1971 and 1973, and they became so successful, that J\u017d brought a second batch between 1978 and 1980. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, they were passed onto [[Serbian Railways|\u017dS]], [[\u017deljezni\u010dki prevoz Crne Gore|\u017dCG]] and [[M\u017d]]. A number have been modernised, having been turned into 461.2 series (Serbia) and 462 series (Macedonia). Further exports were achieved in 1986 and 1987 when the [[Bulgarian State Railways]] brought another number of units, that were also modernized, becoming the 46.2 series (the original series number being 46). Modernization of these locomotives is done by [[Rade Kon\u010dar Zagreb]], [[REMARUL 16 Februarie Cluj]] and [[RELOC Craiova]].\n\nModernisations for the Romanian Railways' locomotives have been done by different companies, and the first of such concepts appeared in the late 1990s when Siemens (along with a few subcontractors) modernised a few units to [[CFR Class 45]]. The modernisations were a success and the locomotives were hailed as \"Romania's first modern electric locomotives\", produced between 1998 and 2002. Production was stopped though, and only a small number were made, all locomotives numbers beginning with 3xx. They were later rebuilt by Softronic Craiova, and up to this date only 1 unrefurbished locomotive (45-0318-1) runs in regular service, seen mostly on Bucharest-Constan\u021ba mainline. Starting with 2006 and 2007, a number of locomotives were rebuilt by Softronic and PROMAT as [[CFR Class 47]], being a more successful modernisation. Refurbishments are done by SCRL Bra\u0219ov, RELOC, INDA and Softronic Craiova, REMAR Pa\u0219cani and Cluj and PROMAT. From 2020 onwards, RELOC Craiova will begin to modernize more members of the classes, after SOFTRONIC quit modernizing locomotives into Class 47s in 2016.\n\nAside from the exported models to \u017dS and BD\u017d, these locomotives operate in Hungary and Slovakia. A number of examples are operated by [[Magyar Mag\u00e1nvas\u00fat Zrt.]], [[Train Hungary]], [[Prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Foxrail]] and [[Floyd Zrt.]], and are used in regular service in those countries. In 1998, [[Railways of Greece|OSE (Greek Railways)]] hired locomotive 060-EA-056 (manufactured 1968) to operate during the opening of the first electrified Greek railway line from [[Thessaloniki]] to [[Idomeni]]/[[Gevgelija]], and was temporarily used until it was returned to CFR.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe locomotive is known for its simplicity in operating - in the cab, original versions have a dashboard with a panel for gauges and switches, a throttle/[[dynamic brake]] wheel and brake levers, alongside with a knob for the horn, which has low/high and soft/hard tonnes and Hasler Bern [[speedometer]]s (mostly replaced by Softronic IVMS speedometers). Subsequently upgraded versions changed that, with the ICOL cabs featuring a throttle/dynamic brake lever, the dashboard is higher and features an on-board computer, and 2 buttons that remove the horn's ability to use the soft/hard tonnes. Certain modernizations (such as by PROMAT but in lower numbers) maintain the \"wheel\" but have a renovated dashboard, somewhat similar to the CFR Class 46.\n\nInside the machines' hall, electric current enters into the oil-cooled [[transformer]], where its converted from 25 kV AC to 1.5 kV, passing through silicon diode [[rectifier]]s where its converted into DC current for the ASEA LJE 108 [[traction motor]]s. There are also 3 ventilation groups that activate after 5 seconds each; the locomotive can start without the ventilators turned on, but only for shunting. Not using the ventilation on higher traction currents will lead to damage to the traction motors. The traction motors weigh 3,7 tonnes, and with all of them running properly, produce up to 5400kW of hourly power, and 5100kW continuous power. \n\nElectric current is obtained with the help of 2 [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]s and the main switch, type IAC-25. Early models till the mid-1970s had ASEA LLXJN 135 (with one skid plate for 120 km/h of maximum speed and with two skid plates for 160 km/h of maximum speed), but beginning with 1975, locomotives began to be delivered with Faiveley EP1 pantographs, which became a standard factory option from the late 1970s onwards. From the 1990s onwards, Faiveley EP2 and EP3 pantographs became more common, while on certain modernized examples (and for a brief period of time in the late 1990s for EA2 302), use Schunk WBLs, with some examples using Stemmann Technik DSA150s and Schunk WBL-Z (single arm) pantographs. EA1 292 was fitted with experimental Faiveley AX pantographs (typically fitted on SNCF [[SNCF Class BB 36000|Astride]] locomotives) between 1997 and 1998, in order to test them for the upcoming Class 45 modernization program. \n\nThe throttle and dynamic brake controller operates in a similar way to the [[BR Class 86]] tap charger mechanysm, with 40 throttle steps (including the 3 initial shunting positions), plus 3 weakfield positions, all displayed on a gauge. Dynamic braking is controlled in the same way as the throttle is, being activated by moving the wheel leftwards (as opposed to rightwards for throttle), with a limit of ~960A for its operation. All locomotives are fitted with standard dynamic braking, but between 1966 and 1991, one unit was fitted experimentally with [[regenerative braking]], however it was very ineconomical to operate, not to mention dangerous for the locomotive and the catenary. The unit, EB 001, was rebuilt and renumbered into EA 931. \n\n===Notable units===\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, multiple locomotives became easily recognizeable due to their liveries, which was in part, due to the drivers of these locomotives customizing them within the cab and outside. As such, it was common to see locomotives using window curtains, tricolor-painted stripes and various shades of the colors used by CFR at the time. Eventually this \"tradition\" died out when multiple locomotives were refurbished or scrapped, but some train drivers continued it in the 2000s and 2010s, including on modernized Class 47s. Certain locomotives also gained various nicknames, instead of a common nickname for the whole class. \n\n*EA 079 was made by Electroputere in 1979, and in the late 1990s it was refurbished by the same company in order to operate at 15 kV AC, for German railway operator [[Karsdorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft]] (this same operator purchased second-hand locomotives from Romania and the former East Germany). With its bankruptcy, it was stored for years in Germany, until ABB refurbished the locomotive in the mid 2010s in Sweden, looking for potential customers. It eventually entered ownership of GFR after a year, being converted back to 25 kV AC operation.\n*EA1 122 was made by Electroputere in 1974, and painted in a livery that featured a orange stripe instead of the standard red/blue stripe, and it also featured tricolor curtains in the cab. After modernization, the dashboard paneling was painted green, but the locomotive's livery became the standard white with red front ends.\n*EA 127 was made by Electroputere in 1976, and in the 1990s it was painted in a blue and grey livery, similar to the ones fitted on DA diesel locomotives when they arrived from Switzerland in 1959. It was scrapped in 2002 at Ciceu.\n*EA 236 was made by Electroputere in 1975, and is one of the few locomotives to still retain its original livery and pantographs, having been refurbished in April 2018 by SCRL Bra\u0219ov to its almost/original condition.\n*EA1 242 was operated by the Bra\u0219ov train depot, and in the 2000s and early 2010s it was well taken care of by its driver. \n*EA 247 was one of the last \"classical\" locomotives with a tricolor stripe and original Hasler speedometer, in 2013 it was modernized into a Class 47.\n*EA 801 was nicknamed \"Dolly\" by the drivers where it was stabled at, and in 1996 it spotted a livery similar to the DA diesels that operated at the time, but with a \"reversed\" stripe (painted in white) and had a white dashboard aswell.\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|CFR Class 40}}\n{{commons category|CFR Class 41}}\n{{commons category|CFR Class 42}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rolling stock of Romania}}\n\n[[Category:Passenger locomotives]]\n[[Category:ASEA locomotives]]\n[[Category:Electroputere locomotives]]\n[[Category:Co\u2032Co\u2032 locomotives]]\n[[Category:25 kV AC locomotives]]\n[[Category:Electric locomotives of Romania]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Romania]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1965]]\n", "name_user": "TrainSimFan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotable units", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroputere_LE5100"}

The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills.<ref>On Fulbright's goal of promoting peace, and the influence of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]] on this, see[[Donald Markwell]], (2013).

MacArthur took a fanatically anti-communist position, arguing that Communism by its very existence was a mortal danger to the United States, which required a policy of seeking to eradicate Communism whatever it existed in the world; from this viewpoint, MacArthur argued that Truman's policy of fighting a \"limited war\" in Korea was dangerous, and the correct policy to follow was to invade China with the aim of overthrowing Mao Zedong and restoring Chiang Kai-shek.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> In response, Fulbright stated: \"I had not myself thought of our enemy as being Communism, I thought of it as primarily being imperialist Russia\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> \n\nFulbright believed that the antagonist was the Soviet Union or \"Russia\" as he preferred to call it, which just happened to be a Communist state, and as such the foreign policy he advocated was anti-Soviet rather than anti-communist.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5-6</ref> At the same time, Fulbright believed that a Third World War would be almost certainly be a nuclear war that might very well spell the end of humanity, and as such he favored the policy of \"containment\" of the Soviet Union instead of the policy of \"rollback\" advocated by MacArthur and many right-wing American politicians such as Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> Furthermore, Fulbright saw the Cold War more as a political struggle rather than a military struggle, and in a 1952 speech criticized Truman for excessively high levels of military spending.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> Fulbright argued that the evidence that the Soviet Union was about to attack the United States was weak, and if a war with the Soviets was extremely unlikely to occur, asked if it was really necessary to devote such a high percentage of the budget to the military.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref>     \n\nThe intellectual Fulbright had a strong personal dislike of the anti-intellectual McCarthy, whose demagogy he viewed as a major threat to American democracy while his promotion of the concept of \"rollback\" he thought likely to cause World War Three.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> In a speech, he called McCarthy an incredibly vulgar and crude man who if unchecked would cause America's institutions to fall victim to \"swinish blight of anti-intellectualism\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> He was the only senator to vote against an appropriation for the [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] in 1954, which was chaired by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Randall|title=Bill Fulbright (1905\u20131995)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1652|publisher=The Central Arkansas Library System|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> Like his friend, Adlai Stevenson, Fulbright was regarded as a \"Cold War liberal\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.7</ref> During the Eisenhower administration, Fulbright tended to support the substance of its policies while criticizing its style.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.7</ref> \n\nIn 1956, Fulbright campaigned across the country for the unsuccessful [[Adlai Stevenson II|Stevenson]]-[[Estes Kefauver|Kefauver]] ticket. He swamped his Republican challenger that year, [[Ben C. Henley]], the state party chairman and a brother of U.S. District Judge [[Jesse Smith Henley]] of [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]]. In his re-election bid in 1956, Fulbright emphasized his opposition to civil rights for Afro-Americans and support for segregation while noting that he also his support for oil companies and that he consistently voted for more farm aid to poultry farmers (one of Arkansas's major exports were chickens).<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6-7</ref>   \n\nFulbright signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] in opposition of the Supreme Court's historic 1954 ''[[Brown v.

Fulbright was alarmed by McCarthy's attack on the VOA and the [[United States Information Agency]], the latter agency at the time supervising educational exchange programs.<ref name=Woods181 /> This was followed by the summer 1953 withdrawal by the State Department of a fellowship for a male student whose wife was suspected of communist affiliation and the scheduling by the Senate Appropriations Committee of a hearing on the annual appropriations of the USIA, the inquiry appearing to put the Fulbright Program at stake.<ref name=Woods181>{{cite book|title=Fulbright: A Biography|pages=181\u2013183|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521482622|first=Randall Bennett|last=Woods}}</ref>\n\nThe confrontation between Fulbright and McCarthy took place in the Supreme Court Chamber of Capitol Hill. McCarthy questioned Fulbright over his knowledge of whether the board clearing students for funding from the USIA received a security check, and on a policy that bars communists and communist sympathizers from receiving appointments as lecturers and professors. McCarthy pressed Fulbright to answer the second question while Fulbright recounted members of the board.<ref name=Woods181 /> McCarthy explained that he believed Fulbright had some level of influence on the Fulbright Program since it bore his name, but Fulbright disagreed, stating that his exerting such influence would destroy the board.<ref name=Woods181 /> After McCarthy insisted that he be authorized to release statements of some Fulbright Program students both praising the communist form of government and condemning American values, Fulbright countered that he was willing to submit thousands of names of students who had praised the US and its way of government in their statements. The encounter was the last time McCarthy made a public assault on the program; leading historian and original Fulbright Program board member Walter Johnson credited Fulbright with preventing the program from being ended by [[McCarthyism]].<ref name=Woods181 />\n\n=== Early segregation activities ===\nIn 1950, Fulbright co-sponsored an amendment, which, if enacted, would allow soldiers to choose whether or not to serve in a racially integrated unit.<ref name=Woods207>{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Randall Bennett|title=J.

Fulbright telephoned Alabama Senators [[John Sparkman]] and [[Lister Hill]] as well as [[Price Daniel]], all of whom agreed to support a moderate version of the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright told his despondent aides that the new version would be the only way Hill and himself would retain influence within the Dixie delegation. The draft put forth by the four senators took a moderate approach to the Supreme Court decision, pledging the southern senators would reverse the ruling through legal moves and recognizing themselves as the minority in the Senate. Hardliners against civil rights were dismayed by the modifications to the document made by Fulbright because they viewed it as casting them as supplicants rather than victims. According to biographer [[Randall Bennett Woods]], Fulbright believed that the South was not yet ready for integration but that education would eventually eradicate prejudice, allowing blacks to \"take their rightful place in American society.\"<ref name=Woods207 /> Fulbright's signing of the Southern Manifesto did not prevent him from being able to survive politically amid growing numbers of black voters in Arkansas.

From Johnson's viewpoint having him support the resolution would bring many of the waverers around to voting for the resolution, as indeed proved to be the case.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.376</ref>    \n\nJohnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the ''Maddox'' had taken place and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whatever the alleged attack had really taken place.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Furthermore, Johnson insisted the resolution, which was a \"functional equivalent to a declaration of war\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> In the 1964 election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \"soft on Communism\" and by contrast promised a \"total victory\" over Communism. Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \"tough on Communism\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Besides for the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\" as Johnson had told him.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> \n\nOn 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and praised Johnson for his \"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \"noble\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's argument, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> Several Senators such as Allen Elleder, Jacob Javits, John Sherman Cooper, Daniel Brewster, George McGovern and Gaylord Nelson were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \"blank cheque\" for a war in southeast Asia, and a meeting Fulbright sought to assure them, saying that passing such a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> Nelson wanted to insert an amendment which would bar the president from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless he obtained the permission of Congress first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of this resolution.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.27</ref> Fulbright persuaded him not to, arguing the resolution was \"harmless\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater?.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.27</ref> Fulbright dismissed Nelson's fears of giving Johnson a \"blank cheque\", saying he had the president's word that \"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\".<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.376</ref>  \n\nOn August 7, 1964, a unanimous House of Representatives and all but two members of the Senate voted to approve the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which led to a dramatic escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].

Many of the earlier hearings, in 1966, were televised to the nation in their entirety (a rarity in the pre\u2013[[C-SPAN]] era). In February 1966, Fulbright held the first hearings about the Vietnam war, where [[George F. Kennan]] and General [[James M. Gavin]] appeared as expert witnesses.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Kennan testified that the Vietnam War was a grotesque distortion of the \"containment\" policy he outlined in 1946-47 while the World War II hero Gavin testified that it was his opinion as a soldier that the war could not be won. On 4 February 1966, in an attempt to upstage the hearings Fulbright was holding in Washington, Johnson called an impromptu [[Declaration of Honolulu, 1966|summit in Honolulu]], hoping that the media would play more attention to the summit he had called than to hearings Fulbright was holding.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> As Fulbright had once been Johnson's friend, his criticism of the war was seen by the president as a personal betrayal, leading Johnson to lash out in especially vitriolic terms against him.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Johnson took the view that at least Senator [[Wayne Morse]] had always been opposed to the Vietnam War whereas Fulbright had promised him to support his Vietnam policy in 1964, causing him to see the latter as a \"Judas\" figure.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref>  Johnson liked to mock Fulbright as \"Senator Halfbright\", sneering it was astonishing that someone as \"stupid\" as Fulbright had been awarded a degree at Oxford.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref>   \n\nIn April 1966, Fulbright delivered a speech at Johns Hopkins University where President Johnson had delivered a forthright defense of the war just a year before, that were sharply critical of the war.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> In his speech delivered in his usual folksy Southern drawl Fulbright stated that the United States was \"in danger of losing its perspective on what exactly is within the realm of its power and what is beyond it\".<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Warning of what he called \"the arrogance of power\", Fulbright declared \"we are not living up to our capacity and promise as a civilized power for the world\", calling the Vietnam war a betrayal of American values.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Johnson was furious with the speech, which he saw  a personal attack from a man who had once been his friend, believing the remark about the \"arrogance of power\" was about him.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Johnson lashed out in a speech where he called Fulbright and other critics of the war \"nervous Nellies\" who knew the war in Vietnam could and would be won and were just too cowardly to fight on to the final victory.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Fulbright published ''The Arrogance of Power'', in which he attacked the justification of the Vietnam War, Congress's failure to set limits on it, and the impulses which gave rise to it. Fulbright's scathing critique undermined the [[power elite|elite consensus]] that U.S. military intervention in [[Indochina]] was necessitated by [[Cold War]] [[geopolitics]].\n\nIn his book, Fulbright offered an analysis of American foreign policy:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout our history two strands have coexisted uneasily; a dominant strand of democratic [[humanism]] and a lesser but durable strand of intolerant [[Religious fanaticism|Puritanism]]. There has been a tendency through the years for reason and moderation to prevail as long as things are going tolerably well or as long as our problems seem clear and finite and manageable. But ... when some event or leader of opinion has aroused the people to a state of high emotion, our puritan spirit has tended to break through, leading us to look at the world through the distorting prism of a harsh and angry moralism.</blockquote>\n\nFulbright also related his opposition to any American tendencies to intervene in the affairs of other nations:\n\n<blockquote>Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favor, conferring upon it a special responsibility for other nations\u2014to make them richer and happier and wiser, to remake them, that is, in its own shining image. Power confuses itself with virtue and tends also to take itself for omnipotence. Once imbued with the idea of a mission, a great nation easily assumes that it has the means as well as the duty to do God's work.</blockquote>\n\nHe was also a strong believer in [[international law]]:\n\n<blockquote>Law is the essential foundation of stability and order both within societies and in international relations. As a conservative power, the United States has a vital interest in upholding and expanding the reign of law in international relations. Insofar as international law is observed, it provides us with stability and order and with a means of predicting the behavior of those with whom we have reciprocal legal obligations. When we violate the law ourselves, whatever short-term advantage may be gained, we are obviously encouraging others to violate the law; we thus encourage disorder and instability and thereby do incalculable damage to our own long-term interests.</blockquote>\n\nBy 1967, the Senate was divided into three blocs. There was an anti-war \"dove\" bloc led by Fulbright; a pro-war \"hawk\" bloc led by the conservative Southern Democrat Senator [[John C. Stennis]] and a third bloc consisting of waverers who tended to shift their positions about war in tune with public opinion, moving variously closer to doves and hawks as they followed the public opinion polls.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.503</ref> In contrast to his hostile attitudes towards Fulbright, Johnson was afraid of being labelled \"soft on Communism\" and he tended to try to appease Stennis and the hawks, who kept pressuring for more and more aggressive measures in Vietnam.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.503</ref> In early 1968, Fulbright was deeply depressed as he stated: \"The President, unfortunately, seems to have closed his mind to the consideration of any alternative, and his Rasputin-W.W. Rostow-seems able to isolate him from other views, and the Secretary [of State] happens to agree. I regret that I am unable to break this crust of immunity\".<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93</ref> However, after [[Robert McNamara]] was fired as Defense Secretary, Fulbright saw a \"ray of light\" as the man who replaced McNamara, [[Clark Clifford]], was a long-standing \"close personal friend\".<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93</ref> Through Johnson had appointed Clifford Defense Secretary because he was a hawk, Fulbright sought to change his mind about Vietnam.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93</ref> Fulbright invited Clifford to a secret meeting where he introduced the newly appointed Defense Secretary to two World War Two heroes, General [[James M. Gavin]] and General [[Matthew Ridgway]].<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93</ref> Both Gavin and Ridgway were emphatic that the United States could not win the war in Vietnam and their opposition to the war helped to change Clifford's mind.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93</ref> Despite his success with Clifford, Fulbright was close to despair as he wrote in a letter to Erich Frommn that this \"literally a miasma of madness in the city, enveloping everyone in the administration and most of those in Congress. I am at a loss of words to describe the idiocy of what we are doing\".<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93</ref>\n\nSeeing that the Johnson administration was reeling in the wake of the Tet Offensive, Fulbright in February 1968 called for hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee into the Gulf of Tonkin incident as Fulbright noted there were several aspects of the claim that North Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked American destroyers in international waters that seemed dubious and questionable.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.94-95</ref> McNamara was subpoenaed, and the televised hearings led to \"fireworks\" as Fulbright repeatedly asked difficult answers about De Soto raids on North Vietnam together with [[Operation 34A]].<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.95</ref> On 11 March 1968, the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.95-96</ref> Through Rusk was scheduled to testify about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the previous day in ''The New York Times'' there appeared a leaked story that General William Westmoreland had requested that Johnson sent 206, 00 more troops to Vietnam.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.96</ref> During Rusk's two days of testimony, the main issue turned out to be the troop request with Fulbright insisting that president seek congressional approval first.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.96</ref> Most notably, several senators who previously voted with Stennis and the hawks now aligned themselves with Fulbright, indicating that Congress was turning against the war.<ref>Berman, William ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.96</ref> \n\nAt the end of October 1968, after President Johnson announced a halt in bombing in North Vietnam in accordance with peace talks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29218|title=572 - The President's Address to the Nation Upon Announcing His Decision To Halt the Bombing of North Vietnam|first=Lyndon B.|last=Johnson|authorlink=Lyndon B.

During World War II, there was much debate about the best way to win the peace after the Allies presumably won the war, with many urging the United States to reject isolationism. The House adopted the Fulbright Resolution which supported international peace-keeping initiatives and encouraged the United States to participate in what became the [[United Nations]] in September 1943.

The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills.<ref>On Fulbright's goal of promoting peace, and the influence of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]] on this, see[[Donald Markwell]], (2013).

In his speeches, Fulbright showed himself to be a Europeanist who was committed to resisting Soviet expansionism in Europe while being hostile to American commitments in Asia.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> Despite his reputation as one of the Senate's leading foreign policy experts, he said almost nothing about the Korean War until China entered the war in October 1950, which he then warned against escalating the war by attacking China as many both outside and inside the government, most notably General Douglas MacArthur, were advocating.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> In a speech on 18 January 1951, he dismissed Korea as a matter of peripheral interest that was not worth fighting World War Three over, and condemned the plans for attacking China as reckless and dangerous.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> In the same speech, he argued that the Soviet Union, not China, was the real enemy and Korea was a distraction from Europe, which he considered to be far more important.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> \n\nWhen President Truman sacked MacArthur for insubordination in April 1951 after MacArthur publicly criticized Truman for deciding to not widen the war when he stated that the United States would not China, Fulbright came to Truman's defense.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> Against MacArthur's argument that there was \"no substitute for victory\" and the Korean War could only be won by expanding it by attacking China, Fulbright stated that the U.S. constitution stated quite explicitly the president was the supreme commander-in-chief and it was the duty of generals to obey the president, not vice-versa.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> When MacArthur appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, having been invited by Republican senators looking for a chance to embarrass Truman, Fulbright embraced the role of Truman's defender.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> During his acrimonious exchanges with MacArthur, a basic difference emerged in their philosophies. MacArthur took a fanatically anti-communist position, arguing that Communism by its very existence was a mortal danger to the United States, which required a policy of seeking to eradicate Communism whatever it existed in the world; from this viewpoint, MacArthur argued that Truman's policy of fighting a \"limited war\" in Korea was dangerous, and the correct policy to follow was to invade China with the aim of overthrowing Mao Zedong and restoring Chiang Kai-shek.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> In response, Fulbright stated: \"I had not myself thought of our enemy as being Communism, I thought of it as primarily being imperialist Russia\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5</ref> \n\nFulbright believed that the antagonist was the Soviet Union or \"Russia\" as he preferred to call it, which just happened to be a Communist state, and as such the foreign policy he advocated was anti-Soviet rather than anti-communist.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5-6</ref> At the same time, Fulbright believed that a Third World War would be almost certainly be a nuclear war that might very well spell the end of humanity, and as such he favored the policy of \"containment\" of the Soviet Union instead of the policy of \"rollback\" advocated by MacArthur and many right-wing American politicians such as Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> Furthermore, Fulbright saw the Cold War more as a political struggle rather than a military struggle, and in a 1952 speech criticized Truman for excessively high levels of military spending.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> Fulbright argued that the evidence that the Soviet Union was about to attack the United States was weak, and if a war with the Soviets was extremely unlikely to occur, asked if it was really necessary to devote such a high percentage of the budget to the military.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref>     \n\nThe intellectual Fulbright had a strong personal dislike of the anti-intellectual McCarthy, whose demagogy he viewed as a major threat to American democracy while his promotion of the concept of \"rollback\" he thought likely to cause World War Three.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> In a speech, he called McCarthy an incredibly vulgar and crude man who if unchecked would cause America's institutions to fall victim to \"swinish blight of anti-intellectualism\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6</ref> He was the only senator to vote against an appropriation for the [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] in 1954, which was chaired by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Randall|title=Bill Fulbright (1905\u20131995)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1652|publisher=The Central Arkansas Library System|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> Like his friend, Adlai Stevenson, Fulbright was regarded as a \"Cold War liberal\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.7</ref> During the Eisenhower administration, Fulbright tended to support the substance of its policies while criticizing its style.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.7</ref> \n\nIn 1956, Fulbright campaigned across the country for the unsuccessful [[Adlai Stevenson II|Stevenson]]-[[Estes Kefauver|Kefauver]] ticket. He swamped his Republican challenger that year, [[Ben C. Henley]], the state party chairman and a brother of U.S. District Judge [[Jesse Smith Henley]] of [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]]. In his re-election bid in 1956, Fulbright emphasized his opposition to civil rights for Afro-Americans and support for segregation while noting that he also his support for oil companies and that he consistently voted for more farm aid to poultry farmers (one of Arkansas's major exports were chickens).<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6-7</ref>   \n\nFulbright signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] in opposition of the Supreme Court's historic 1954 ''[[Brown v.

For all his seniority and powerful committee posts, he was not considered a part of the Senate's inner circle of friends and power brokers. He seemed to prefer it this way: the man who [[Harry Truman]] called an \"overeducated SOB\" was, in the words of [[Clayton Fritchey]], \"an individualist and a thinker\", a man whose \"intellectualism alone alienates him from the Club\" of the Senate.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Fritchey |first=Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Fritchey |date=May 1967 |title=Washington Insight: Who Belongs to the Senate's Inner Club? |magazine=[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |publisher=Harper's Foundation |volume=234 |issue=1404 |pages=104\u2013108 |url=https://harpers.org/archive/1967/05/who-belongs-to-the-senates-inner-club/ |accessdate=October 30, 2018 }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\n=== McCarthy confrontation ===\nThe Republicans gained a majority in the Senate following the 1952 elections, allowing Wisconsin Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] to become chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations.<ref>{{cite book |last = Fried |first = Richard M. |year = 1990 |title = Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective |publisher = Oxford University Press |page = 134 |isbn = 0-19-504361-8}}</ref> A month into McCarthy's tenure, Fulbright received a letter from former Connecticut Senator [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]] with whom he had developed a friendship during the Jessup hearings. Benton had lost his re-election bid the previous November after being targeted by anti-communist supporters of McCarthy. Benton urged Fulbright to assume a leading role in opposition to McCarthy and pledged he would receive support for doing so.<ref name=Woods181 /> Fulbright, though sympathetic toward Benton, wished to follow the guideline set by Senate Minority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] who indicated his unwillingness to have Democrats become involved in condemnation of McCarthy. Fulbright was alarmed by McCarthy's attack on the VOA and the [[United States Information Agency]], the latter agency at the time supervising educational exchange programs.<ref name=Woods181 /> This was followed by the summer 1953 withdrawal by the State Department of a fellowship for a male student whose wife was suspected of communist affiliation and the scheduling by the Senate Appropriations Committee of a hearing on the annual appropriations of the USIA, the inquiry appearing to put the Fulbright Program at stake.<ref name=Woods181>{{cite book|title=Fulbright: A Biography|pages=181\u2013183|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521482622|first=Randall Bennett|last=Woods}}</ref>\n\nThe confrontation between Fulbright and McCarthy took place in the Supreme Court Chamber of Capitol Hill. McCarthy questioned Fulbright over his knowledge of whether the board clearing students for funding from the USIA received a security check, and on a policy that bars communists and communist sympathizers from receiving appointments as lecturers and professors. McCarthy pressed Fulbright to answer the second question while Fulbright recounted members of the board.<ref name=Woods181 /> McCarthy explained that he believed Fulbright had some level of influence on the Fulbright Program since it bore his name, but Fulbright disagreed, stating that his exerting such influence would destroy the board.<ref name=Woods181 /> After McCarthy insisted that he be authorized to release statements of some Fulbright Program students both praising the communist form of government and condemning American values, Fulbright countered that he was willing to submit thousands of names of students who had praised the US and its way of government in their statements. The encounter was the last time McCarthy made a public assault on the program; leading historian and original Fulbright Program board member Walter Johnson credited Fulbright with preventing the program from being ended by [[McCarthyism]].<ref name=Woods181 />\n\n=== Early segregation activities ===\nIn 1950, Fulbright co-sponsored an amendment, which, if enacted, would allow soldiers to choose whether or not to serve in a racially integrated unit.<ref name=Woods207>{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Randall Bennett|title=J.

Fulbright telephoned Alabama Senators [[John Sparkman]] and [[Lister Hill]] as well as [[Price Daniel]], all of whom agreed to support a moderate version of the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright told his despondent aides that the new version would be the only way Hill and himself would retain influence within the Dixie delegation. The draft put forth by the four senators took a moderate approach to the Supreme Court decision, pledging the southern senators would reverse the ruling through legal moves and recognizing themselves as the minority in the Senate. Hardliners against civil rights were dismayed by the modifications to the document made by Fulbright because they viewed it as casting them as supplicants rather than victims. According to biographer [[Randall Bennett Woods]], Fulbright believed that the South was not yet ready for integration but that education would eventually eradicate prejudice, allowing blacks to \"take their rightful place in American society.\"<ref name=Woods207 /> Fulbright's signing of the Southern Manifesto did not prevent him from being able to survive politically amid growing numbers of black voters in Arkansas. He delivered an address to the Arkansas Democratic Voters' Association where he insisted his intervention had led to the moderate version of the Southern Manifesto and his claims were generally accepted by Arkansan black leadership.<ref name=Woods207 />\n\n===Vietnam War and U.S. foreign policy===\nIn August 1961, as the Kennedy administration held firm in its commitment to a five-year foreign aid program, Fulbright and [[Pennsylvania]] representative [[Thomas E.

Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \"tough on Communism\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Besides for the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\" as Johnson had told him.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25</ref> \n\nOn 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and praised Johnson for his \"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \"noble\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\".<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's argument, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> Several Senators such as Allen Elleder, Jacob Javits, John Sherman Cooper, Daniel Brewster, George McGovern and Gaylord Nelson were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \"blank cheque\" for a war in southeast Asia, and a meeting Fulbright sought to assure them, saying that passing such a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26</ref> Nelson wanted to insert an amendment which would bar the president from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless he obtained the permission of Congress first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of this resolution.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.27</ref> Fulbright persuaded him not to, arguing the resolution was \"harmless\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater?.<ref>Berman, ''William Fulbright and the Vietnam War'', Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.27</ref> Fulbright dismissed Nelson's fears of giving Johnson a \"blank cheque\", saying he had the president's word that \"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\".<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.376</ref>  \n\nOn August 7, 1964, a unanimous House of Representatives and all but two members of the Senate voted to approve the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which led to a dramatic escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].

Many of the earlier hearings, in 1966, were televised to the nation in their entirety (a rarity in the pre\u2013[[C-SPAN]] era). In February 1966, Fulbright held the first hearings about the Vietnam war, where [[George F. Kennan]] and General [[James M. Gavin]] appeared as expert witnesses.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Kennan testified that the Vietnam War was a grotesque distortion of the \"containment\" policy he outlined in 1946-47 while the World War II hero Gavin testified that it was his opinion as a soldier that the war could not be won. On 4 February 1966, in an attempt to upstage the hearings Fulbright was holding in Washington, Johnson called an impromptu [[Declaration of Honolulu, 1966|summit in Honolulu]], hoping that the media would play more attention to the summit he had called than to hearings Fulbright was holding.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> As Fulbright had once been Johnson's friend, his criticism of the war was seen by the president as a personal betrayal, leading Johnson to lash out in especially vitriolic terms against him.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Johnson took the view that at least Senator [[Wayne Morse]] had always been opposed to the Vietnam War whereas Fulbright had promised him to support his Vietnam policy in 1964, causing him to see the latter as a \"Judas\" figure.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref>  Johnson liked to mock Fulbright as \"Senator Halfbright\", sneering it was astonishing that someone as \"stupid\" as Fulbright had been awarded a degree at Oxford.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref>   \n\nIn April 1966, Fulbright delivered a speech at Johns Hopkins University where President Johnson had delivered a forthright defense of the war just a year before, that were sharply critical of the war.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> In his speech delivered in his usual folksy Southern drawl Fulbright stated that the United States was \"in danger of losing its perspective on what exactly is within the realm of its power and what is beyond it\".<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Warning of what he called \"the arrogance of power\", Fulbright declared \"we are not living up to our capacity and promise as a civilized power for the world\", calling the Vietnam war a betrayal of American values.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Johnson was furious with the speech, which he saw  a personal attack from a man who had once been his friend, believing the remark about the \"arrogance of power\" was about him.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref> Johnson lashed out in a speech where he called Fulbright and other critics of the war \"nervous Nellies\" who knew the war in Vietnam could and would be won and were just too cowardly to fight on to the final victory.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.486</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Fulbright published ''The Arrogance of Power'', in which he attacked the justification of the Vietnam War, Congress's failure to set limits on it, and the impulses which gave rise to it. Fulbright's scathing critique undermined the [[power elite|elite consensus]] that U.S. military intervention in [[Indochina]] was necessitated by [[Cold War]] [[geopolitics]].\n\nIn his book, Fulbright offered an analysis of American foreign policy:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout our history two strands have coexisted uneasily; a dominant strand of democratic [[humanism]] and a lesser but durable strand of intolerant [[Religious fanaticism|Puritanism]]. There has been a tendency through the years for reason and moderation to prevail as long as things are going tolerably well or as long as our problems seem clear and finite and manageable. But ... when some event or leader of opinion has aroused the people to a state of high emotion, our puritan spirit has tended to break through, leading us to look at the world through the distorting prism of a harsh and angry moralism.</blockquote>\n\nFulbright also related his opposition to any American tendencies to intervene in the affairs of other nations:\n\n<blockquote>Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favor, conferring upon it a special responsibility for other nations\u2014to make them richer and happier and wiser, to remake them, that is, in its own shining image. Power confuses itself with virtue and tends also to take itself for omnipotence. Once imbued with the idea of a mission, a great nation easily assumes that it has the means as well as the duty to do God's work.</blockquote>\n\nHe was also a strong believer in [[international law]]:\n\n<blockquote>Law is the essential foundation of stability and order both within societies and in international relations. As a conservative power, the United States has a vital interest in upholding and expanding the reign of law in international relations. Insofar as international law is observed, it provides us with stability and order and with a means of predicting the behavior of those with whom we have reciprocal legal obligations. When we violate the law ourselves, whatever short-term advantage may be gained, we are obviously encouraging others to violate the law; we thus encourage disorder and instability and thereby do incalculable damage to our own long-term interests.</blockquote>\n\nBy 1967, the Senate was divided into three blocs. There was an anti-war \"dove\" bloc led by Fulbright; a pro-war \"hawk\" bloc led by the conservative Southern Democrat Senator [[John C.
