A wiki engine is a type of [[content management system]], but it differs from most other such systems, including [[blog software]], in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.<ref name=\"Easy Wiki Hosting \"/> There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as [[bug tracking system]]s. Some wiki engines are [[open-source software|open source]], whereas others are [[proprietary software|proprietary]]. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.\n\nThe online encyclopedia project [[Wikipedia]] is the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of the most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top ten since 2007.<ref name=\"Alexa Top Sites\">{{citation|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites|title=Alexa Top Sites|accessdate=December 1, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302173920/http://www.alexa.com/topsites|archivedate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language. In addition to Wikipedia, there are hundreds of thousands of other wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis functioning as [[knowledge management]] resources, [[notetaking software|notetaking]] tools, [[Web community|community websites]], and [[intranet]]s.

Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape.\n\nA wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people require to contribute is a computer, [[Internet]] access, a [[web browser]], and a basic understanding of a [[simple markup language]] (e.g., [[MediaWiki markup language]]). A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a \"wiki page\", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well-interconnected by [[hyperlink]]s, is \"the wiki\". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex, and networked text, while also allowing for editor argument, debate, and interaction regarding the content and formatting.<ref name=\"Legal\">{{citation|title=Legal Issues for Wikis: The Challenge of User-generated and Peer-produced Knowledge, Content and Culture|last1=Black|first1=Peter|last2=Delaney|first2=Hayden|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Brian|volume=14|publisher=eLaw J.|year=2007|url=https://elaw.murdoch.edu.au/archives/issues/2007/1/eLaw_legal%20issues%20for%20wikis.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222125337/https://elaw.murdoch.edu.au/archives/issues/2007/1/eLaw_legal%20issues%20for%20wikis.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2012}}</ref> A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review by a moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of [[User (computing)|user]] accounts. Many edits can be made in [[Real-time web|real-time]] and appear almost instantly online, but this feature facilitates abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require [[Authentication|user authentication]] to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. [[Maged N. Kamel Boulos]], Cito Maramba, and [[Steve Wheeler]] write that the open wikis produce a process of [[Social Darwinism]].{{\"}} Sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited, and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. While such [[openness]] may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page.\"<ref name=BMC/>\n\n===Editing===\n{{for|the project page on editing Wikitext on Wikipedia|Help:Wikitext}}\n{{Wikitext navbox}}\n==== Navigation ====\nSome wikis have an Edit button or link directly on the page being viewed, if the user has permission to edit the page. This can lead to a text-based editing page where participants can structure and format wiki pages with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as '''Wikitext''', '''Wiki markup''' or '''Wikicode''' (it can also lead to a [[WYSIWYG]] editing page; see [[#Visual editing|the paragraph after the table below]]). For example, starting lines of text with [[asterisk]]s could create a [[Bullet (typography)|bulleted list]]. The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations,{{example needed|date=August 2018}} some of which also allow [[HTML]] tags.\n\n==== Consistency ====\nWikis have favoured plain-text editing, with fewer and simpler conventions than HTML, for indicating style and structure. Although limiting access to HTML and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel, and having [[JavaScript]] disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit other users' access.\n\n==== Basic syntax ====\n{| class=\"wikitable noprint\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:33.3%;\"|[[MediaWiki]] syntax (the \"behind the scenes\" code used to add formatting to text)\n! style=\"width:33.3%;\"|Equivalent HTML (another type of \"behind the scenes\" code used to add formatting to text)\n! style=\"width:33.3%;\"|Rendered output (seen onscreen by a regular web user)\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"moin\">\"Take some more [[tea]],\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n\"I've had '''nothing''' yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't take ''less'',\" said the Hatter. \"It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing.\"</syntaxhighlight>\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=html><p>\"Take some more <a href=\"/wiki/Tea\" title=\"Tea\">tea</a>,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've had <b>nothing</b> yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"You mean you can't take <i>less</i>,\" said the Hatter. \"It's very easy to take <i>more</i> than nothing.\"</p></syntaxhighlight>\n|\"Take some more [[tea]],\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n\"I've had '''nothing''' yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't take ''less'',\" said the Hatter. \"It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing.\"\n|}\n{{anchor|visual}} {{anchor|wysiwyg}} {{anchor|WYSIWYG}}\n==== Visual editing ====\nWikis can also make [[WYSIWYG]] editing available to users, usually by means of JavaScript control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding [[HTML element|HTML tags]] or wikitext. In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server [[transparency (human-computer interaction)|transparently]], shielding the user from this technical detail. An example of this is the [[VisualEditor]] on Wikipedia. WYSIWYG controls do not, however, always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.\n\n==== Version history ====\nSome wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages; often, every version of the page is stored. This means that authors can revert to an older version of the page should it be necessary because a mistake has been made, such as the content accidentally being deleted or the page has been vandalized to include offensive or malicious text or other inappropriate content.\n\n==== Edit summary ====\nMany wiki implementations, such as [[MediaWiki]], the software that powers [[Wikipedia]], allow users to supply an ''edit summary'' when they edit a page. This is a short piece of text summarizing the changes they have made (e.g., \"Corrected grammar,\" or \"Fixed formatting in table.\"). It is not inserted into the article's main text, but is stored along with that revision of the page, allowing users to explain what has been done and why, similar to a log message when making changes in a [[revision control|revision-control]] system. This enables other users to see which changes have been made by whom and why, often in a list of summaries, dates and other short, relevant content, a list which is called a \"log\" or \"history.\"\n\n===Navigation===\nWithin the text of most pages, there are usually many [[hypertext]] links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more \"native\" to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain \"by hand\", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an [[ad hoc]], unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a [[backlink]] feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically \"tag\" pages with categories or keywords, to make it easier for other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on [[cold weather cycling]] might \"tag\" this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.\n\n===Linking and creating pages===\nLinks are created using a specific syntax, the so-called \"link pattern\". Originally, most wikis{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} used [[CamelCase]] to name pages and create links. These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word \"CamelCase\" is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links in a form that deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. \"WiKi\" instead of \"Wiki\"). CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as \"TableOfContents\" and \"BeginnerQuestions.\" It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links \"pretty\" by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. This reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is, however, limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, \"RichardWagner\" should be rendered as \"Richard Wagner\", whereas \"PopularMusic\" should be rendered as \"popular music\". There is no easy way to determine which [[capital letter]]s should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have \"free linking\" using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.\n\n===Searching===\nMost wikis offer at least a title [[search algorithm|search]], and sometimes a [[Full text search|full-text search]]. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as [[PmWiki]], use [[flat file]]s.<ref name=Augar>{{cite journal |title=Teaching and learning online with wikis |pages=95\u2013104 |last1=Naomi |first1=Augar |first2=Ruth |last2=Raitman |first3=Wanlei |last3=Zhou |publisher=Proceedings of Beyond the Comfort Zone: 21st ASCILITE Conference |citeseerx=10.1.1.133.1456|year=2004}}</ref> MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]] in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as [[Google Search]] can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of wikis}}\n[[File:HNL Wiki Wiki Bus.jpg|thumb|[[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]] at [[Honolulu International Airport]]]]\n[[WikiWikiWeb]] was the first wiki.<ref name=\"ebersbach10\">{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=10}}</ref> Ward Cunningham started developing WikiWikiWeb in Portland, Oregon, in 1994, and installed it on the [[Domain name|Internet domain]] [[c2.com]] on March 25, 1995.

In the early 2000s (decade), wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some [[corporate wiki|companies use wikis]] as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance [[group learning]]. There may be greater use of wikis behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] than on the public Internet. On March 15, 2007, the word ''wiki'' was listed in the online ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref name=\"OED1\">{{cite dictionary | url = http://www.oed.com/public/update0703/march-2007-update | title = March 2007 update | dictionary = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | date = March 1, 2007 | last = Diamond | first = Graeme | accessdate = March 16, 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110107132110/http://www.oed.com/public/update0703/march-2007-update | archivedate = January 7, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Alternative definitions==\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word \"wiki\" was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them; the latter definition is still occasionally in use.<ref name=\"Easy Wiki Hosting\">{{citation |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc700339.aspx |title=Easy Wiki Hosting, Scott Hanselman's blog, and Snagging Screens |date=July 2008 |last=Mitchell |first=Scott |publisher=MSDN Magazine |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316192702/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc700339.aspx |archivedate=March 16, 2010  }}</ref> Wiki inventor Ward Cunningham wrote in 2014<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=531149812976996352|user=WardCunningham|title=The plural of wiki is wiki.

He wrote that the concept of wiki federation, in which the same content can be hosted and edited in more than one location in a manner similar to [[distributed version control]], meant that the concept of a single discrete \"wiki\" no longer made sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/an-install-of-wiki|title=Smallest Federated Wiki|work=wiki.org|accessdate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928165957/http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/an-install-of-wiki|archivedate=September 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\n{{see also|List of wiki software}}\n[[Wiki software]] is a type of [[collaborative software]] that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing [[web server]], or as a standalone [[application server]] that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a [[file system]], and changes to the content are stored in a [[relational database management system]]. A commonly implemented software package is [[MediaWiki]], which runs [[Wikipedia]]. Alternatively, [[personal wiki]]s run as a standalone application on a single computer. [[WikidPad]] is an example. One application, [[TiddlyWiki]], simply makes use of an even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside.\n\nWikis can also be created on a \"[[wiki farm]]\", where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner. [[PBwiki]], [[Socialtext]], and [[Wikia]] are popular examples of such services. Some wiki farms can also make private, password-protected wikis. Free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page. For more information, see [[Comparison of wiki farms]].\n\n==Trust and security==\n\n===Controlling changes===\n{{Selfref|\"Recent changes\" redirects here. For the Wikipedia help page, see [[Help:Recent changes]]. For the recent changes page itself, see [[Special:RecentChanges]].}}\n[[File:History Comparison Example (Vector).png|thumb|History comparison reports highlight the changes between two revisions of a page.]]\nWikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes, rather than making it difficult to make them. Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the \"Recent Changes\" page\u2014a specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=20}}</ref> Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts (\"[[Internet bot|bots]]\").<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=54}}</ref> From the change log, other functions are accessible in most wikis: the [[Changelog|revision history]] shows previous page versions and the [[diff]] feature highlights the changes between two revisions. Using the revision history, an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article. This gives great power to the author to eliminate edits. The diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary. A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the \"Recent Changes\" page and, if it is an unacceptable edit, consult the history, restoring a previous revision; this process is more or less streamlined, depending on the wiki software used.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=178}}</ref>\n\nIn case unacceptable edits are missed on the \"recent changes\" page, some wiki engines provide additional content control. It can be monitored to ensure that a page, or a set of pages, keeps its quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages, allowing them to verify the validity of new editions quickly. This can be seen as a very pro-author and anti-editor feature.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=109}}</ref> A watchlist is a common implementation of this. Some wikis also implement \"patrolled revisions\", in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark some edits as not vandalism. A \"flagged revisions\" system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.<ref>{{citation|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|journal=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|last = Goldman | first = Eric|volume=8}}</ref>\n\n===Trustworthiness and reliability of content===\n[[File:Wiki-quality-dimensions.png|thumb|right|Quality dimensions of the wiki and other sources: [[Wikipedia]] use case<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330087836 |chapter=Measures for Quality Assessment of Articles and Infoboxes in Multilingual Wikipedia |last=Lewoniewski |first=W\u0142odzimierz |year=2019 |isbn=978-3-030-04849-5 |volume=339 |pages=619\u2013633 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04849-5_53|title=Business Information Systems Workshops |series=Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing }}</ref>]] Critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals (\"vandals\") or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content.

For example, [[cybervandalism|vandalism]] (changing wiki content to something offensive, adding nonsense, or deliberately adding incorrect information, such as [[hoax]] information) can be a major problem. On larger wiki sites, such as those run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], [[vandalism]] ''can ''go unnoticed for some period of time. Wikis, because of their open nature, are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as \"[[troll (Internet)|trolling]]\".\nWikis tend to take a ''[[soft security|soft-security]]'' approach to the problem of vandalism, making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage. Larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit. In this way, vandalism can be limited to just \"minor vandalism\" or \"sneaky vandalism\", where the characters added/eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m3m.homelinux.org/wikiMC/index.php/Security |title=Security |publisher=Assothink |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040941/http://m3m.homelinux.org/wikiMC/index.php/Security |archivedate=January 6, 2014  }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2013|failed=y}} An example of a bot that reverts vandalism on Wikipedia is ClueBot NG.

For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users, identified by their [[IP address]]es, to edit content, while others limit this function to just registered users. Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account,<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=108}}</ref> but give registered users additional editing functions; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the [[English Wikipedia]], registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old and has made at least ten edits. Other wikis such as the [[Portuguese Wikipedia]] use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor. [[Vandalism of Wikipedia]] is common (though policed and usually reverted) because it is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it, although this makes it grow rapidly. In contrast, [[Citizendium]] requires an editor's real name and short autobiography, affecting the growth of the wiki but sometimes helping stop vandalism.\n\nEdit wars can also occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor. In some cases, editors with opposing views of which content should appear or what formatting style should be used will change and re-change each other's edits. This results in the page being \"unstable\" from a general users' perspective, because each time a general user comes to the page, it may look different. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.<ref name=Legal/> Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions can be traced back to the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies.<ref name=Augar/> The issue of wiki vandalism is debated. In some cases, when an editor deletes an entire article and replaces it with nonsense content, it may be a \"test edit\", made by the user as she or he is experimenting with the wiki system. Some editors may not realize that they have damaged the page, or if they do realize it, they may not know how to undo the mistake or restore the content.\n\n====Potential malware vector====\n[[Malware]] can also be a problem for wikis, as users can add links to sites hosting malicious code. For example, a German Wikipedia article about the [[Blaster Worm]] was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website. Users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link would be infected.<ref name=Legal/> A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a [[blacklist]] of malicious sites.<ref>[[meta:Spam blacklist/About|Meta.wikimedia.org]]</ref>\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Applications===\n[[File:EnglishWikipedia 29June2017.png|thumb|right|The home page of the English Wikipedia]]\nThe English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the [[World Wide Web]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s23.org/wikistats/largest_html.php?sort=users_desc&th=8000&lines=500 |title=List of largest (Media)wikis |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |publisher=S23-Wiki |date=April 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825164715/http://s23.org/wikistats/largest_html.php?sort=users_desc&th=8000&lines=500 |archivedate=August 25, 2014 }}</ref> and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites|title=Alexa Top 500 Global Sites|accessdate=April 26, 2015|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302173920/http://www.alexa.com/topsites|archivedate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> Other large wikis include the [[WikiWikiWeb]], [[Memory Alpha]], [[Wikivoyage]], and [[Susning.nu]], a Swedish-language knowledge base.

Much of this information might not be appropriate for [[encyclopedia]]s such as [[Wikipedia]] (e.g., articles on every retail outlet in a town), but might be appropriate for a wiki with more localized content and viewers. A city wiki could also contain information about the following subjects, that may or may not be appropriate for a general knowledge wiki, such as:\n* Details of public establishments such as public houses, bars, accommodation or social centers\n* Owner name, opening hours and statistics for a specific shop\n* Statistical information about a specific road in a city\n* Flavors of ice cream served at a local ice cream parlor\n* A biography of a local mayor and other persons\n\n===WikiNodes===\n{{redirect|WikiNode|WikiNode of Wikipedia|Wikipedia:WikiNode|the app for the Apple iPad|WikiNodes}}\n[[File:Development of \"Mathe f\u00fcr Nicht-Freaks\" from Sep 2009 to June 2016.webm|thumb|Visualization of the collaborative work in\nthe German wiki project [[b:de:Mathe f\u00fcr Nicht-Freaks|Mathe f\u00fcr Nicht-Freaks]]]]\nWikiNodes are pages on wikis that describe related wikis.

Wikipedia, for instance, has an extensive set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; Wikipedia has a neutral point of view; Wikipedia is free content; Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner; and Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, [[Conservapedia]] commands, among other things, that its editors use \"[[Before Christ|B.C.]]\" rather than \"[[B.C.E.]]\" when referring to years prior to [[Common Era|C.E.]] 1 and refrain from \"unproductive activity.\"<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |work=Conservapedia.com |title=Conservapedia Commandments |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022014810/http://conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |archivedate=October 22, 2010  }}</ref> One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki, \"[[The Golden Rule|Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you]].\"<ref name=Augar/>\n\n==Legal environment==\nJoint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become [[tenants in common]] of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.<ref name=Legal/> Where persons contribute to a [[collective work]] such as an encyclopedia, there is, however, no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable.<ref>{{citation |work=Redwood Music Ltd v. B Feldman & Co Ltd|year=1979|publisher=RPC 385}}</ref> Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an [[open content]] license. Version 2 of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; [[Creative Commons]] licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki, although the legal basis for such an implied license may not exist in all circumstances.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWikis and their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, he may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities.<ref name=Legal/> In the United States, wikis may benefit from [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]], which protects sites that engage in \"[[Good Samaritan]]\" policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Self-Regulation: How Wikipedia Leverages User-Generated Quality Control Under Section 230 | first1 = Kathleen M. | last1 = Walsh | first2 = Sarah | last2 = Oh | date = February 23, 2010 | url = http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=sarah_oh | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040705/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=sarah_oh | archivedate = January 6, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> It has also been argued, however, that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks.<ref>{{Citation|last = Myers | first = Ken S.|title=Wikimmunity: Fitting the Communications Decency Act to Wikipedia |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Technology|publisher=The Berkman Center for Internet and Society|year=2008|ssrn=916529|volume=20|page=163}}</ref> When [[defamation]] occurs on a wiki, theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the \"publication.\" It remains to be seen whether wikis will be regarded as more akin to an [[internet service provider]], which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher.<ref name=Legal/> It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions.

Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape.\n\nA wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people require to contribute is a computer, [[Internet]] access, a [[web browser]], and a basic understanding of a [[simple markup language]] (e.g., [[MediaWiki markup language]]). A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a \"wiki page\", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well-interconnected by [[hyperlink]]s, is \"the wiki\". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex, and networked text, while also allowing for editor argument, debate, and interaction regarding the content and formatting.<ref name=\"Legal\">{{citation|title=Legal Issues for Wikis: The Challenge of User-generated and Peer-produced Knowledge, Content and Culture|last1=Black|first1=Peter|last2=Delaney|first2=Hayden|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Brian|volume=14|publisher=eLaw J.|year=2007|url=https://elaw.murdoch.edu.au/archives/issues/2007/1/eLaw_legal%20issues%20for%20wikis.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222125337/https://elaw.murdoch.edu.au/archives/issues/2007/1/eLaw_legal%20issues%20for%20wikis.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2012}}</ref> A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review by a moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of [[User (computing)|user]] accounts. Many edits can be made in [[Real-time web|real-time]] and appear almost instantly online, but this feature facilitates abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require [[Authentication|user authentication]] to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. [[Maged N. Kamel Boulos]], Cito Maramba, and [[Steve Wheeler]] write that the open wikis produce a process of [[Social Darwinism]].{{\"'}} Sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited, and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. While such [[openness]] may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page.\"<ref name=BMC/>\n\n===Editing===\n{{for|the project page on editing Wikitext on Wikipedia|Help:Wikitext}}\n{{Wikitext navbox}}\n==== Navigation ====\nSome wikis have an Edit button or link directly on the page being viewed, if the user has permission to edit the page. This can lead to a text-based editing page where participants can structure and format wiki pages with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as '''Wikitext''', '''Wiki markup''' or '''Wikicode''' (it can also lead to a [[WYSIWYG]] editing page; see [[#Visual editing|the paragraph after the table below]]). For example, starting lines of text with [[asterisk]]s could create a [[Bullet (typography)|bulleted list]]. The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations,{{example needed|date=August 2018}} some of which also allow [[HTML]] tags.\n\n==== Consistency ====\nWikis have favoured plain-text editing, with fewer and simpler conventions than HTML, for indicating style and structure. Although limiting access to HTML and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel, and having [[JavaScript]] disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit other users' access.\n\n==== Basic syntax ====\n{| class=\"wikitable noprint\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:33.3%;\"|[[MediaWiki]] syntax (the \"behind the scenes\" code used to add formatting to text)\n! style=\"width:33.3%;\"|Equivalent HTML (another type of \"behind the scenes\" code used to add formatting to text)\n! style=\"width:33.3%;\"|Rendered output (seen onscreen by a regular web user)\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"moin\">\"Take some more [[tea]],\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n\"I've had '''nothing''' yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't take ''less'',\" said the Hatter. \"It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing.\"</syntaxhighlight>\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=html><p>\"Take some more <a href=\"/wiki/Tea\" title=\"Tea\">tea</a>,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've had <b>nothing</b> yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"You mean you can't take <i>less</i>,\" said the Hatter. \"It's very easy to take <i>more</i> than nothing.\"</p></syntaxhighlight>\n|\"Take some more [[tea]],\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n\"I've had '''nothing''' yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't take ''less'',\" said the Hatter. \"It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing.\"\n|}\n{{anchor|visual}} {{anchor|wysiwyg}} {{anchor|WYSIWYG}}\n==== Visual editing ====\nWikis can also make [[WYSIWYG]] editing available to users, usually by means of JavaScript control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding [[HTML element|HTML tags]] or wikitext. In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server [[transparency (human-computer interaction)|transparently]], shielding the user from this technical detail. An example of this is the [[VisualEditor]] on Wikipedia. WYSIWYG controls do not, however, always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.\n\n==== Version history ====\nSome wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages; often, every version of the page is stored. This means that authors can revert to an older version of the page should it be necessary because a mistake has been made, such as the content accidentally being deleted or the page has been vandalized to include offensive or malicious text or other inappropriate content.\n\n==== Edit summary ====\nMany wiki implementations, such as [[MediaWiki]], the software that powers [[Wikipedia]], allow users to supply an ''edit summary'' when they edit a page. This is a short piece of text summarizing the changes they have made (e.g., \"Corrected grammar,\" or \"Fixed formatting in table.\"). It is not inserted into the article's main text, but is stored along with that revision of the page, allowing users to explain what has been done and why, similar to a log message when making changes in a [[revision control|revision-control]] system. This enables other users to see which changes have been made by whom and why, often in a list of summaries, dates and other short, relevant content, a list which is called a \"log\" or \"history.\"\n\n===Navigation===\nWithin the text of most pages, there are usually many [[hypertext]] links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more \"native\" to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain \"by hand\", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an [[ad hoc]], unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a [[backlink]] feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically \"tag\" pages with categories or keywords, to make it easier for other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on [[cold weather cycling]] might \"tag\" this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.\n\n===Linking and creating pages===\nLinks are created using a specific syntax, the so-called \"link pattern\". Originally, most wikis{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} used [[CamelCase]] to name pages and create links. These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word \"CamelCase\" is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links in a form that deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. \"WiKi\" instead of \"Wiki\"). CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as \"TableOfContents\" and \"BeginnerQuestions.\" It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links \"pretty\" by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. This reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is, however, limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, \"RichardWagner\" should be rendered as \"Richard Wagner\", whereas \"PopularMusic\" should be rendered as \"popular music\". There is no easy way to determine which [[capital letter]]s should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have \"free linking\" using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.\n\n===Searching===\nMost wikis offer at least a title [[search algorithm|search]], and sometimes a [[Full text search|full-text search]]. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as [[PmWiki]], use [[flat file]]s.<ref name=Augar>{{cite journal |title=Teaching and learning online with wikis |pages=95\u2013104 |last1=Naomi |first1=Augar |first2=Ruth |last2=Raitman |first3=Wanlei |last3=Zhou |publisher=Proceedings of Beyond the Comfort Zone: 21st ASCILITE Conference |citeseerx=10.1.1.133.1456|year=2004}}</ref> MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]] in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as [[Google Search]] can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of wikis}}\n[[File:HNL Wiki Wiki Bus.jpg|thumb|[[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]] at [[Honolulu International Airport]]]]\n[[WikiWikiWeb]] was the first wiki.<ref name=\"ebersbach10\">{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=10}}</ref> Ward Cunningham started developing WikiWikiWeb in Portland, Oregon, in 1994, and installed it on the [[Domain name|Internet domain]] [[c2.com]] on March 25, 1995.

Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some [[corporate wiki|companies use wikis]] as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance [[group learning]]. There may be greater use of wikis behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] than on the public Internet.

He wrote that the concept of wiki federation, in which the same content can be hosted and edited in more than one location in a manner similar to [[distributed version control]], meant that the concept of a single discrete \"wiki\" no longer made sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/an-install-of-wiki|title=Smallest Federated Wiki|work=wiki.org|accessdate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928165957/http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/an-install-of-wiki|archivedate=September 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\n{{see also|List of wiki software}}\n[[Wiki software]] is a type of [[collaborative software]] that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing [[web server]], or as a standalone [[application server]] that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a [[file system]], and changes to the content are stored in a [[relational database management system]]. A commonly implemented software package is [[MediaWiki]], which runs [[Wikipedia]]. Alternatively, [[personal wiki]]s run as a standalone application on a single computer. [[WikidPad]] is an example. One application, [[TiddlyWiki]], simply makes use of an even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside.\n\nWikis can also be created on a \"[[wiki farm]]\", where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner. [[PBwiki]], [[Socialtext]], and [[Wikia]] are popular examples of such services. Some wiki farms can also make private, password-protected wikis. Free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page. For more information, see [[Comparison of wiki farms]].\n\n==Trust and security==\n\n===Controlling changes===\n{{Selfref|\"Recent changes\" redirects here. For the Wikipedia help page, see [[Help:Recent changes]]. For the recent changes page itself, see [[Special:RecentChanges]].}}\n[[File:History Comparison Example (Vector).png|thumb|History comparison reports highlight the changes between two revisions of a page.]]\nWikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes, rather than making it difficult to make them. Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the \"Recent Changes\" page\u2014a specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=20}}</ref> Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts (\"[[Internet bot|bots]]\").<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=54}}</ref> From the change log, other functions are accessible in most wikis: the [[Changelog|revision history]] shows previous page versions and the [[diff]] feature highlights the changes between two revisions. Using the revision history, an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article. This gives great power to the author to eliminate edits. The diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary. A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the \"Recent Changes\" page and, if it is an unacceptable edit, consult the history, restoring a previous revision; this process is more or less streamlined, depending on the wiki software used.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=178}}</ref>\n\nIn case unacceptable edits are missed on the \"recent changes\" page, some wiki engines provide additional content control. It can be monitored to ensure that a page, or a set of pages, keeps its quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages, allowing them to verify the validity of new editions quickly. This can be seen as a very pro-author and anti-editor feature.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=109}}</ref> A watchlist is a common implementation of this. Some wikis also implement \"patrolled revisions\", in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark some edits as not vandalism. A \"flagged revisions\" system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.<ref>{{citation|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|journal=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|last = Goldman | first = Eric|volume=8}}</ref>\n\n===Trustworthiness and reliability of content===\n[[File:Wiki-quality-dimensions.png|thumb|right|Quality dimensions of the wiki and other sources: [[Wikipedia]] use case<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330087836 |chapter=Measures for Quality Assessment of Articles and Infoboxes in Multilingual Wikipedia |last=Lewoniewski |first=W\u0142odzimierz |year=2019 |isbn=978-3-030-04849-5 |volume=339 |pages=619\u2013633 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04849-5_53|title=Business Information Systems Workshops |series=Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing }}</ref>]] Critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals (\"vandals\") or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content.

For example, [[cybervandalism|vandalism]] (changing wiki content to something offensive, adding nonsense, or deliberately adding incorrect information, such as [[hoax]] information) can be a major problem. On larger wiki sites, such as those run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], [[vandalism]] ''can ''go unnoticed for some period of time. Wikis, because of their open nature, are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as \"[[troll (Internet)|trolling]]\".\nWikis tend to take a ''[[soft security|soft-security]]'' approach to the problem of vandalism, making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage. Larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit. In this way, vandalism can be limited to just \"minor vandalism\" or \"sneaky vandalism\", where the characters added/eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m3m.homelinux.org/wikiMC/index.php/Security |title=Security |publisher=Assothink |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040941/http://m3m.homelinux.org/wikiMC/index.php/Security |archivedate=January 6, 2014  }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2013|failed=y}} An example of a bot that reverts vandalism on Wikipedia is ClueBot NG. ClueBot NG can revert edits, often within minutes, if not seconds. The bot uses [[machine learning]] in lieu of [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|title = This machine kills trolls|date = February 18, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014|website = The Verge|last = Hicks|first = Jesse|url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archivedate = August 27, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe amount of vandalism a wiki receives depends on how open the wiki is. For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users, identified by their [[IP address]]es, to edit content, while others limit this function to just registered users. Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account,<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=108}}</ref> but give registered users additional editing functions; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the [[English Wikipedia]], registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old and has made at least ten edits. Other wikis such as the [[Portuguese Wikipedia]] use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor. [[Vandalism of Wikipedia]] is common (though policed and usually reverted) because it is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it, although this makes it grow rapidly. In contrast, [[Citizendium]] requires an editor's real name and short autobiography, affecting the growth of the wiki but sometimes helping stop vandalism.\n\nEdit wars can also occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor. In some cases, editors with opposing views of which content should appear or what formatting style should be used will change and re-change each other's edits. This results in the page being \"unstable\" from a general users' perspective, because each time a general user comes to the page, it may look different. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.<ref name=Legal/> Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions can be traced back to the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies.<ref name=Augar/> The issue of wiki vandalism is debated. In some cases, when an editor deletes an entire article and replaces it with nonsense content, it may be a \"test edit\", made by the user as she or he is experimenting with the wiki system. Some editors may not realize that they have damaged the page, or if they do realize it, they may not know how to undo the mistake or restore the content.\n\n====Potential malware vector====\n[[Malware]] can also be a problem for wikis, as users can add links to sites hosting malicious code. For example, a German Wikipedia article about the [[Blaster Worm]] was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website. Users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link would be infected.<ref name=Legal/> A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a [[blacklist]] of malicious sites.<ref>[[meta:Spam blacklist/About|Meta.wikimedia.org]]</ref>\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Applications===\n[[File:EnglishWikipedia 29June2017.png|thumb|right|The home page of the English Wikipedia]]\nThe English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the [[World Wide Web]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s23.org/wikistats/largest_html.php?sort=users_desc&th=8000&lines=500 |title=List of largest (Media)wikis |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |publisher=S23-Wiki |date=April 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825164715/http://s23.org/wikistats/largest_html.php?sort=users_desc&th=8000&lines=500 |archivedate=August 25, 2014 }}</ref> and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites|title=Alexa Top 500 Global Sites|accessdate=April 26, 2015|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302173920/http://www.alexa.com/topsites|archivedate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> Other large wikis include the [[WikiWikiWeb]], [[Memory Alpha]], [[Wikivoyage]], and [[Susning.nu]], a Swedish-language knowledge base.

Wikipedia, for instance, has an extensive set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; Wikipedia has a neutral point of view; Wikipedia is free content; Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner; and Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, [[Conservapedia]] commands, among other things, that its editors use \"[[Before Christ|B.C.]]\" rather than \"[[B.C.E.]]\" when referring to years prior to [[Common Era|C.E.]] 1 and refrain from \"unproductive activity.\"<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |work=Conservapedia.com |title=Conservapedia Commandments |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022014810/http://conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |archivedate=October 22, 2010  }}</ref> One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki, \"[[The Golden Rule|Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you]].\"<ref name=Augar/>\n\n==Legal environment==\nJoint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become [[tenants in common]] of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.<ref name=Legal/> Where persons contribute to a [[collective work]] such as an encyclopedia, there is, however, no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable.<ref>{{citation |work=Redwood Music Ltd v. B Feldman & Co Ltd|year=1979|publisher=RPC 385}}</ref> Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an [[open content]] license. Version 2 of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; [[Creative Commons]] licenses are also popular.

The NCSS glossary instead suggests \"flood plain\".<ref name=\"LandformGloss\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download?cid=nrcs142p2_053182&ext=pdf | title=Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms | publisher=[[National Cooperative Soil Survey]] | work=National Soil Survey Handbook\u2014Part 629 | date=April 2013 | format=PDF | accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n* [[Canterbury Plains]], [[Southland Plains]], and [[Waikato Plains]] in [[New Zealand]]\n* [[Chiayi-Tainan Plain|Chianan Plain]] in [[Taiwan]]\n* Lower [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]\n* [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061915/Punjab-Plain Punjab Plain], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n* [[Iskar (river)]] valleys in Bulgaria\n* [[Mekong Delta]] in [[Vietnam]]\n* [[Mesaoria]] in [[Cyprus]]\n* [[Mesopotamia]] in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]\n* [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]], [[Oxnard Plain]], and [[Laguna de Santa Rosa]] in the [[United States]]<ref>[http://tapestry.usgs.gov/features/45mississippi.html Mississippi River alluvial plain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705102948/http://tapestry.usgs.gov/features/45mississippi.html |date=2007-07-05 }}</ref>\n* [[North China Plain]] in [[China]]\n* [[Palakaria]] Valley in [[Bulgaria]]\n* [[Po valley|Po Valley]] in [[Italy]]\n* [[Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta|Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt]] in the [[Netherlands]]\n* [[Struma (river)|Struma]] Valley in Bulgaria\n* [[Tundzha]] valleys in Bulgaria\n* [[List of alluvial sites in Switzerland|Multiple sites]] in [[Switzerland]]\n* [[Upper Thracian Plain]] in Bulgaria\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alluvial fan]]\n* [[Alluvium]]\n* [[Coastal plain]]\n* [[Desert pavement]]\n* [[River delta]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Alluvial plains}}\n\n[[Category:Fluvial landforms]]\n[[Category:Plains|+]]\n[[Category:Geography terminology]]\n", "name_user": "12.235.90.102", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_plain"}

DeWitt]].\n\nThis site was managed before the war by the federal [[Bureau of Reclamation]] for a major irrigation project. Construction of the 650 military-style barracks and surrounding guard towers began in June 1942, and the camp opened on August 11, when the first Japanese Americans arrived by train from the [[Fairplex|Pomona]], [[Santa Anita Park|Santa Anita]], and [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland]] [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly centers]]. The camp would hold a total of 13,997 Japanese Americans over the next three years, with a peak population of 10,767, making it the third-largest \"town\" in Wyoming before it closed on November 10, 1945.<ref name=Matsumoto>Matsumoto, Mieko. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Heart%20Mountain/ Heart Mountain],\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

The site of the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center is considered to retain the highest integrity of the ten incarceration centers constructed during World War II. The street grid and numerous foundations are still visible. Four of the original barracks survive in place. A number of others sold and moved after the war have been identified in surrounding counties and may one day be returned to their original locations.

Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to create zones from which \"any or all persons may be excluded.\" The War Department had requested this and designated Western Washington and Oregon, southern Arizona, and all of California as Exclusion Zones on March 2, 1942. Four days later, the executive order informally extended to [[Alaska]], covering the entire [[West Coast of the United States]].<ref>[https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/Guard-US/ch5.htm Chapter V: Japanese Evacuation From the West Coast, page 143]</ref> It defined Japanese Americans, Italian Americans and German Americans as peoples to be excluded from these areas. Soon after the War Department initiated the removal of over 110,000 Japanese Americans from these areas, forcing them into temporary \"assembly centers\" run by the [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|Wartime Civil Control Administration]]. Typically, these centers were hastily converted large public spaces, such as fairgrounds and horse racing tracks, while construction on Heart Mountain and the other more permanent \"[[Internment of Japanese Americans#WRA Relocation Centers|relocation centers]]\" were completed.\n\n[[File:Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Heart Mountain, Wyoming.

The high school, which educated 1,500 students in its first year, featured regular classrooms, a gymnasium and library.

Question 27 asked whether men would be willing to serve in the armed forces, while Question 28 asked inmates to forswear all allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. Many, confused by the questionnaire's wording, fearing it was a trick and any answer would be misconstrued, or, offended by the questions' implications, answered \"no\" to one or both questions, or gave a qualified response like, \"I will serve when I am free.\" Soon after, Kiyoshi Okamoto organized the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]] to protest the infringement of Nisei citizen rights, and Frank Emi, Paul Nakadate and others began posting fliers around camp encouraging others not to respond to the questions.<ref name=Emi>Newman, Esther. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Frank%20Emi/ Frank Emi],\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

Construction of the 650 military-style barracks and surrounding guard towers began in June 1942, and the camp opened on August 11, when the first Japanese Americans arrived by train from the [[Fairplex|Pomona]], [[Santa Anita Park|Santa Anita]], and [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland]] [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly centers]].

The site of the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center is considered to retain the highest integrity of the ten incarceration centers constructed during World War II. The street grid and numerous foundations are still visible. Four of the original barracks survive in place. A number of others sold and moved after the war have been identified in surrounding counties and may one day be returned to their original locations. In early 2007, {{convert|124|acre|ha|1}} of the center were listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]]. The Federal Bureau of Reclamation owns {{convert|74|acre|ha|1}} within the landmark boundary and currently administers the site.

In 1897, {{convert|120,000|acre|ha|1}} of land surrounding the [[Shoshone River]] in northwestern Wyoming was purchased by [[Buffalo Bill|William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody]] and Nate Salisbury, who in May 1899 acquired water rights to irrigate {{convert|60,000|acre|ha|1}} surrounding [[Cody, Wyoming]].<ref name=Shoshone1>Stene, Eric A. \"[http://www.usbr.gov/projects//ImageServer?imgName=Doc_1305642556544.pdf Shoshone Project History],\" (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 1996), p 3.</ref> After the project proved too costly for the original investors, the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners petitioned the federal government to take it over.

Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to create zones from which \"any or all persons may be excluded.\" The War Department had requested this and designated Western Washington and Oregon, southern Arizona, and all of California as Exclusion Zones on March 2, 1942. Four days later, the executive order informally extended to [[Alaska]], covering the entire [[West Coast of the United States]].<ref>[https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/Guard-US/ch5.htm Chapter V: Japanese Evacuation From the West Coast, page 143]</ref> It defined Japanese Americans, Italian Americans and German Americans as peoples to be excluded from these areas. Soon after the War Department initiated the removal of over 110,000 Japanese Americans from these areas, forcing them into temporary \"assembly centers\" run by the [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|Wartime Civil Control Administration]]. Typically, these centers were hastily converted large public spaces, such as fairgrounds and horse racing tracks, while construction on Heart Mountain and the other more permanent \"[[Internment of Japanese Americans#WRA Relocation Centers|relocation centers]]\" were completed.\n\n[[File:Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Heart Mountain, Wyoming.

Question 27 asked whether men would be willing to serve in the armed forces, while Question 28 asked inmates to forswear all allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. Many, confused by the questionnaire's wording, fearing it was a trick and any answer would be misconstrued, or, offended by the questions' implications, answered \"no\" to one or both questions, or gave a qualified response like, \"I will serve when I am free.\" Soon after, Kiyoshi Okamoto organized the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]] to protest the infringement of Nisei citizen rights, and Frank Emi, Paul Nakadate and others began posting fliers around camp encouraging others not to respond to the questions.<ref name=Emi>Newman, Esther. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Frank%20Emi/ Frank Emi],\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles has passed.<ref name=malone />   \n \nSchools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Opt-out criteria are determined at a state level. In the United States, opt-outs take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2019, 46 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership.

The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles has passed.<ref name=malone />   \n \nSchools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Opt-out criteria are determined at a state level. In the United States, opt-outs take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2019, 46 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership.

The program was ostensibly a [[Star vehicle|vehicle]] for Hesseman, best known for his role as radio DJ [[Dr. Johnny Fever]] on the sitcom ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' (1978\u20131982). Hesseman left ''Head of the Class'' in 1990 and was replaced by Scottish comedian [[Billy Connolly]] (in his first major American production) as teacher Billy MacGregor for the final season. After the series ended, Connolly appeared in a short-lived [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] titled ''[[Billy (1992 TV series)|Billy]]''.\n\nThe series was created and executive produced by Richard Eustis and [[Michael Elias]]. Elias had previously worked as a New York City [[substitute teacher]] while hoping to become an actor.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Head of the Class'' is mainly set in the classroom of academically gifted high school students, all in the Individualized Honors Program at Millard Fillmore High School in New York City.  (Exterior shots of the school were of NYC's [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]].<ref>http://www.nysonglines.com/lexington.htm </ref>) As the series opens, Charlie Moore has been assigned as a substitute teacher to the IHP class.\n\nThe teachers and school administrators seen regularly are:\n\n*Charles P. \"Charlie\" Moore ([[Howard Hesseman]]), a dedicated, if unorthodox history teacher who is committed to ensuring his genius-level students succeed academically while also gaining [[emotional intelligence]].  He originally came to NYC to pursue acting, and maintains an interest in theatre throughout the run of the show. Some episodes would have Charlie directing the class in school productions of musicals such as ''[[Hair]]'' or ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''. He leaves the school after season 4, having landed the lead role in a touring production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''.\n*William C. \"Billy\" MacGregor ([[Billy Connolly]]), Mr. Moore's replacement in season 5.  A cheerful Scotsman, Billy is more brash and energetic than his often laid-back predecessor, but is equally concerned with his students' overall well-being.\n*Dr. Harold Samuels ([[William G. Schilling]]), the blustery, overweight principal of Filmore High.  Dr. Samuels created the IHP program, and is very protective of it, while relishing the students' achievements and valuing the prestige they bring to the school. He also distrusts the teaching methods of both Charlie and Billy, concerned that these methods \u2013 which often involve helping the IHP students branch out of their comfort zones, as well as using unorthodox methods of teaching the class subject at hand \u2013 might distract them too much from their studies.\n*Bernadette Meara ([[Jeannetta Arnette]]), the sometimes flirty but level-headed assistant principal. There is some romantic tension between Ms. Meara and Charlie, and she later has a romantic friendship with Billy.\n\n''Head of the Class'' deals with an entire classroom of academically gifted high school students. The IHP students comprise a diverse range of personalities, ethnicities, and academic specialties.  For the first three years of the show, the IHP class has ten students:\n\n*Arvid Engen ([[Dan Frischman]]), a generally upbeat, skinny, bespectacled [[nerd]].  Arvid is a mathematics expert, and budding scientist.\n*Dennis Blunden ([[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]), an overweight, wisecracking computer whiz whose fields are chemistry and physics.  Cynical, prone to playing sometimes cruel practical jokes, and not always entirely ethical, Dennis has a knack for getting the socially inept Arvid involved in various schemes.\n*Alan Pinkard ([[Tony O'Dell]]), an ultra-[[conservatism|conservative]] [[preppy]] and egotist; his area of expertise is [[political science]] and he is a devout fan of [[Ronald Reagan]]. Alan competes for the highest grades in the class with Darlene.\n*Darlene Merriman ([[Robin Givens]]), a spoiled rich girl who is probably even more self-centered than Alan and whose specialties are speech and debate. Both Alan and Darlene held the ambition of being named class valedictorian.\n*Sarah Nevins ([[Kimberly Russell]]), who is absent appear in the pilot.  Cheerful and well-liked, unlike most of the rest of the class Sarah does not seem to have any one particular area of expertise.  (She does mention her ambition to be a doctor.)  Sarah's the most down-to-earth of the IHP class and was once cited as having the lowest G.P.A.\n*Maria Borges ([[Leslie Bega]]), who is very passionate about getting A's, going as far as grounding herself in the pilot episode for getting a 'B'.  Though initially wanting to be a psychiatrist, she eventually decides she wants to be a singer.\n*Jawaharlal Choudhury (Jory Husain aka Joher Coleman), a recently-arrived student from India whose expertise is natural science.\n*Janice Lazarotto ([[Tannis Vallely]]), despite being only 10, is in high school and the IHP class because of her advanced intellect. She is already qualified to enter Harvard, and is in fact deluged with admissions offers from colleges, but her parents insist Janice attend high school in order to mature emotionally.\n*Simone Foster ([[Khrystyne Haje]]) a quiet, sensitive redhead with a particular fondness for poetry. A notable development in the show is the relationship between Simone and Eric.\n*Eric Mardian ([[Brian Robbins]]), an aspiring writer and, outwardly, the most unlikely member of the IHP.  Eric wears black leather, drives a motorcycle, acts tough, and ostensibly dislikes anything academic (to Dr. Samuels's delight, he is the only one in the class not on the academic team, although he would never leave the IHP). Eric constantly hits on Simone (on whom he has a crush) and the two eventually have an on-again-off-again romance.\n\nAlso seen in a recurring role during seasons 1 and 2 is Marcia Christie as Lori Applebaum.  Lori is an attractive Fillmore High student who is not in the IHP; Arvid has an ongoing crush on her.\n\nThere was some turnover in the cast in seasons four and five. At the beginning of season 4, it is announced that Janice -- despite being younger than the others -- has been accepted to [[Harvard]] as a sophomore, and has left the school. It's also established that Maria transferred to [[Performing Arts High School]], and Jawaharlal moved to California with his family. (Two season 4 episodes were actually leftover from season 3; these three characters appear in these \"leftover\" episodes.)  New students in the IHP include:\n*Aristotle McKenzie ([[De'voreaux White]]), an aspiring filmmaker described by Dennis as \"an extra from ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''\" for his [[dreadlocks]].\n*Viki Amory ([[Lara Piper]]), a [[new-age]]r interested in [[quantum physics]] and skin-revealing clothing.\n*Alex Torres ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]), an aspiring archaeologist and self-styled ladies' man who transferred from [[parochial school]].\n*Theola June \"T.J.\" Jones ([[Rain Pryor]]), who had first appeared as a potential IHP member in season three, and is seen frequently thereafter.  She is eventually added to the cast partway through season 4.  T.J., who had a chip-on-her-shoulder attitude, was originally in the remedial class at Fillmore before proving she had the capacity to join the IHP.\n*Jasper Kwong ([[Jonathan Ke Quan]]) is introduced as a new transfer student late in season 4.\n\nAt the beginning of season 5, it's announced that Mr. Moore got his big break, accepting the lead role in a touring version of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', and has quit teaching.  Billy McGregor becomes Mr. Moore's replacement.  The students are now in their final year of high school, and as the series concludes, Fillmore High School is slated for demolition immediately after graduation.  The entire class graduates, with Dennis getting accepted at MIT, Arvid at Cal Tech, and Alan at Harvard.  On-again off-again couple Simone and Eric, who had become engaged, decide to cancel their engagement and go their separate ways, though they don't discount the possibility of getting back together after they finish college.  As well, Janice unexpectedly turns up for the graduation ceremony, as she had never formally received her high school diploma.  (By this point, she had already graduated from Harvard, and was lining up a job interview at IBM.)  The series concluded with the class all receiving their diplomas.\n\nIn the series, the students often faced off against the rival [[Bronx High School of Science]]. Also, in every season, the IHP students produced the school musical. Musicals staged by the students included ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', and '' [[Hair (musical)|Hair]].'' A number of someday-famous actors made appearances on the show, including [[Brad Pitt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2012/12/03/mike-tyson-brad-pitt-had-sex-with-my-wife/|title=Mike Tyson: 'Brad Pitt had sex with my wife'|first=PageSix com|last=Staff|date=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Show open===\nThe opening of the show features various New York landmarks as well as Charlie Moore's journey to work every day. Charlie lives in a building in Hell's Kitchen occupied by a plant distributor on the first floor, who gives him a ride to the subway at 50th Street on the back of the truck before he makes his first delivery of the day. After Charlie grabs a hot dog for breakfast, he begins running into trouble as the subway station is on fire and he cannot hail any taxis to take him to the school. Forced to walk out of frustration, Charlie arrives late to class to the chagrin of Dr. Samuels but once he enters the classroom, his expression immediately brightens as he sees the students. It wouldn't be until season two that the credits include adding the names of the characters portrayed by their respective actors/actresses. After three seasons with the same opening, it was changed to a group photo of the class for season four. After Hesseman left the show, it was changed to notebook graphics for its final season.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regular characters===\n\n* Charles P. \"Charlie\" Moore &ndash; [[Howard Hesseman]] (1986&ndash;1990; Seasons 1&ndash;4) is the history and social studies teacher who teaches the honors program to intellectual geniuses and help them aim for their dreams.  \n* Billy MacGregor &ndash; [[Billy Connolly]] (1990&ndash;1991; Season 5) took over Mr. Moore's class in season 5.

Although they are gifted academically, the IHP students had plenty of problems in their personal lives, and Mr. Moore not only is there to listen, he shows an unswerving ability to get the students to solve their own problems while making it seem like they came up with the answers on their own. By Episode 6 (\"Teacher's Teacher\"), the class's original teacher Mr. Thomas ([[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) had returned to Fillmore High, seemingly ready to return to the IHP class once Mr. Moore's tenure ended. After observing Mr. Moore's unorthodox teaching methods for most of the episode (much to Charlie's chagrin, as it also made apparent how much he would miss the IHP students), Mr. Thomas ultimately reveals he had no intention to return but came to observe Mr. Moore after hearing concerns about him from Dr. Samuels.  Seeing Mr. Moore in action, Mr. Thomas gives him his blessing, leaving Mr. Moore to become their full-time teacher, knowing the IHP will be in good hands. Throughout the first season, Mr. Moore attempted to get the class involved in more than just their studies, encouraging them to play volleyball and make a music video for the school's time capsule (this marks the first foray into the fondness of ''Head of the Class'' for musical production numbers). At the same time, the class brought Mr. Moore into the present, acclimating him to the importance of personal computers. Near the end of the season, the IHP faces their Russian counterparts in an academic tournament, foreshadowing their famous trip to Moscow in season three.\n\n===Season two (1987&ndash;1988)===\nSeason two began involving the IHP in the school as a whole, with Mr. Moore involving the class in the school literary journal and encouraging a lampoon of the school newspaper.  Mr. Moore also decides to put on a school production of the musical ''Grease'', and encourages the IHP (who are initially reluctant) to participate, alongside other Fillmore students.\n\nWhile first season had some episodes that showed Charlie's personal life outside school, these become increasingly rare as the series continues.  In season 2 (and thereafter), episodes consistently focus on the lives of the IHP students, with only a very few focusing specifically on Charlie; this is the last season in which we see Charlie's apartment.\n\n===Season three (1988&ndash;1989)===\n\n====\"Mission to Moscow\"====\nIn 1988, ''Head of the Class'' broke new ground as it became the first American sitcom to be filmed in the Soviet Union and was entirely filmed in Moscow.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nThe IHP is invited to come to the country for a rematch of the academic meet that happened in season one, which ended in a tie. The class has a lot of experiences while in Moscow: Dennis and Arvid take an interest in two beautiful women, until they realize they might be [[KGB]] spies; Eric meets up with his relatives in what is a very positive experience for him; [[capitalism|capitalist]] Alan has an argument with a die-hard [[socialist]] in a store (who is also on the opposing Russian academic team); Sarah and Darlene decide to record the sights and sounds of Moscow; Simone goes to put flowers on a poet's grave and meets up with a charming Russian musician; Dr. Samuels believes that his hotel room is [[Covert listening device|bugged]], but ends up making a fool of himself; and Charlie has a brief romance with a schoolteacher.\n\nThe IHP eventually wins the meet and the respect of the Russian team. The episode concludes with both teams attending a concert in [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] swaying to the song \"Far Away Lands\" (written and performed by American [[David Pomeranz]] and Russian rock star [[Alexander Malinin|Sasha Malinin]]).\n\n===Season four (1989&ndash;1990)===\nThe fourth season saw some significant changes to the cast of characters&nbsp;\u2013 Maria, Jawaharlal and Janice left (Maria went to a performing arts school, Jawaharlal moved to California, and Janice went to Harvard as a sophomore). Several new characters took their place: Alex Torres ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]) was a Hispanic athletics student, somewhat stereotypically portrayed as having an eye for the ladies. Although Alex seemed attracted to Darlene particularly, both he and Eric competed for the affections of another new IHP student, the blonde hippie Viki Amory ([[Lara Piper]]). Another new character was aspiring filmmaker Aristotle McKenzie ([[De'voreaux White]]). T.J. Jones ([[Rain Pryor]]), a recurring character since the third season, joined the IHP in the fourth season (a remedial student with a streetwise attitude, T.J. was found to be smart enough to join the IHP). Also, the character of Jasper Kwong ([[Jonathan Ke Quan]]) was added to the IHP class late in the season. The season also showed them film a two-part episode at the [[NASA Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. The students' final year of high school was split over seasons four and five. Howard Hesseman left the show after the fourth season.\n\n===Season five (1990\u20131991)===\nIn the first episode of season five, Scottish teacher Billy MacGregor ([[Billy Connolly]]) arrived to replace the departed Charlie Moore (in the first episode of the season, it is explained to the dismayed IHP students that Mr. Moore's acting career finally took off). Despite initial uncertainty and some hostility from the students, Billy proved to be a successful replacement for Charlie. He insisted that the students refer to him by his first name, and although he was more rousing and less laid-back than his predecessor, he proved to be just as wise and caring (Billy also had a habit of boisterously greeting his class every morning with the phrase, \"good morning, geniuses\", and facetiously barking to his students to, \"get out of here\", when the bell rang at the end of the class. He also taught his class in a manner more akin to a stand-up comedian than a teacher). Many episodes from this season focused on Billy having to adapt to living in America, and his attempts to romance Ms. Meara. Other aspects of Billy were his dislike of an outdated French textbook, which actually prompted one student to take a spur-of-the-moment jaunt to Paris, and his encouragement to the male students that the best way to get girls was to be themselves. The season (and the program itself) concluded with the IHP students graduating from high school. Janice Lazarotto (from seasons one&ndash;three) returned for a guest appearance in the finale, in which T.J. is named class [[valedictorian]] and the school is closed down and demolished.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Head of the Class episodes}}\n{{:List of Head of the Class episodes}}\n\n==Novel tie-in==\nOne major novelization was released, with the plotlines based on six episodes of the show.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The book makes all the chapters flow together as one story, even though they didn't happen one right after the other on the show.

The program was ostensibly a [[Star vehicle|vehicle]] for Hesseman, best known for his role as radio DJ [[Dr. Johnny Fever]] on the sitcom ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' (1978\u20131982). Hesseman left ''Head of the Class'' in 1990 and was replaced by Scottish comedian [[Billy Connolly]] (in his first major American production) as teacher Billy MacGregor for the final season. After the series ended, Connolly appeared in a short-lived [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] titled ''[[Billy (1992 TV series)|Billy]]''.\n\nThe series was created and executive produced by Richard Eustis and [[Michael Elias]]. Elias had previously worked as a New York City [[substitute teacher]] while hoping to become an actor.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Head of the Class'' is mainly set in the classroom of academically gifted high school students, all in the Individualized Honors Program at Millard Fillmore High School in New York City.  (Exterior shots of the school were of NYC's [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]]<ref>http://www.nysonglines.com/lexington.htm </ref>.) As the series opens, Charlie Moore has been assigned as a substitute teacher to the IHP class.\n\nThe teachers and school administrators seen regularly are:\n\n*Charles P. \"Charlie\" Moore ([[Howard Hesseman]]), a dedicated, if unorthodox history teacher who is committed to ensuring his genius-level students succeed academically while also gaining [[emotional intelligence]].  He originally came to NYC to pursue acting, and maintains an interest in theatre throughout the run of the show. Some episodes would have Charlie directing the class in school productions of musicals such as ''[[Hair]]'' or ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''. He leaves the school after season 4, having landed the lead role in a touring production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''.\n*William C. \"Billy\" MacGregor ([[Billy Connolly]]), Mr. Moore's replacement in season 5.  A cheerful Scotsman, Billy is more brash and energetic than his often laid-back predecessor, but is equally concerned with his students' overall well-being.\n*Dr. Harold Samuels ([[William G. Schilling]]), the blustery, overweight principal of Filmore High.  Dr. Samuels created the IHP program, and is very protective of it, while relishing the students' achievements and valuing the prestige they bring to the school. He also distrusts the teaching methods of both Charlie and Billy, concerned that these methods \u2013 which often involve helping the IHP students branch out of their comfort zones, as well as using unorthodox methods of teaching the class subject at hand \u2013 might distract them too much from their studies.\n*Bernadette Meara ([[Jeannetta Arnette]]), the sometimes flirty but level-headed assistant principal. There is some romantic tension between Ms. Meara and Charlie, and she later has a romantic friendship with Billy.\n\n''Head of the Class'' deals with an entire classroom of academically gifted high school students. The IHP students comprise a diverse range of personalities, ethnicities, and academic specialties.  For the first three years of the show, the IHP class has ten students:\n\n*Arvid Engen ([[Dan Frischman]]), a generally upbeat, skinny, bespectacled [[nerd]].  Arvid is a mathematics expert, and budding scientist.\n*Dennis Blunden ([[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]), an overweight, wisecracking computer whiz whose fields are chemistry and physics.  Cynical, prone to playing sometimes cruel practical jokes, and not always entirely ethical, Dennis has a knack for getting the socially inept Arvid involved in various schemes.\n*Alan Pinkard ([[Tony O'Dell]]), an ultra-[[conservatism|conservative]] [[preppy]] and egotist; his area of expertise is [[political science]] and he is a devout fan of [[Ronald Reagan]]. Alan competes for the highest grades in the class with Darlene.\n*Darlene Merriman ([[Robin Givens]]), a spoiled rich girl who is probably even more self-centered than Alan and whose specialties are speech and debate. Both Alan and Darlene held the ambition of being named class valedictorian.\n*Sarah Nevins ([[Kimberly Russell]]), who is absent appear in the pilot.  Cheerful and well-liked, unlike most of the rest of the class Sarah does not seem to have any one particular area of expertise.  (She does mention her ambition to be a doctor.)  Sarah's the most down-to-earth of the IHP class and was once cited as having the lowest G.P.A.\n*Maria Borges ([[Leslie Bega]]), who is very passionate about getting A's, going as far as grounding herself in the pilot episode for getting a 'B'.  Though initially wanting to be a psychiatrist, she eventually decides she wants to be a singer.\n*Jawaharlal Choudhury (Jory Husain aka Joher Coleman), a recently-arrived student from India whose expertise is natural science.\n*Janice Lazarotto ([[Tannis Vallely]]), despite being only 10, is in high school and the IHP class because of her advanced intellect. She is already qualified to enter Harvard, and is in fact deluged with admissions offers from colleges, but her parents insist Janice attend high school in order to mature emotionally.\n*Simone Foster ([[Khrystyne Haje]]) a quiet, sensitive redhead with a particular fondness for poetry. A notable development in the show is the relationship between Simone and Eric.\n*Eric Mardian ([[Brian Robbins]]), an aspiring writer and, outwardly, the most unlikely member of the IHP.  Eric wears black leather, drives a motorcycle, acts tough, and ostensibly dislikes anything academic (to Dr. Samuels's delight, he is the only one in the class not on the academic team, although he would never leave the IHP). Eric constantly hits on Simone (on whom he has a crush) and the two eventually have an on-again-off-again romance.\n\nAlso seen in a recurring role during seasons 1 and 2 is Marcia Christie as Lori Applebaum.  Lori is an attractive Fillmore High student who is not in the IHP; Arvid has an ongoing crush on her.\n\nThere was some turnover in the cast in seasons four and five. At the beginning of season 4, it is announced that Janice -- despite being younger than the others -- has been accepted to [[Harvard]] as a sophomore, and has left the school. It's also established that Maria transferred to [[Performing Arts High School]], and Jawaharlal moved to California with his family. (Two season 4 episodes were actually leftover from season 3; these three characters appear in these \"leftover\" episodes.)  New students in the IHP include:\n*Aristotle McKenzie ([[De'voreaux White]]), an aspiring filmmaker described by Dennis as \"an extra from ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''\" for his [[dreadlocks]].\n*Viki Amory ([[Lara Piper]]), a [[new-age]]r interested in [[quantum physics]] and skin-revealing clothing.\n*Alex Torres ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]), an aspiring archaeologist and self-styled ladies' man who transferred from [[parochial school]].\n*Theola June \"T.J.\" Jones ([[Rain Pryor]]), who had first appeared as a potential IHP member in season three, and is seen frequently thereafter.  She is eventually added to the cast partway through season 4.  T.J., who had a chip-on-her-shoulder attitude, was originally in the remedial class at Fillmore before proving she had the capacity to join the IHP.\n*Jasper Kwong ([[Jonathan Ke Quan]]) is introduced as a new transfer student late in season 4.\n\nAt the beginning of season 5, it's announced that Mr. Moore got his big break, accepting the lead role in a touring version of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', and has quit teaching.  Billy McGregor becomes Mr. Moore's replacement.  The students are now in their final year of high school, and as the series concludes, Fillmore High School is slated for demolition immediately after graduation.  The entire class graduates, with Dennis getting accepted at MIT, Arvid at Cal Tech, and Alan at Harvard.  On-again off-again couple Simone and Eric, who had become engaged, decide to cancel their engagement and go their separate ways, though they don't discount the possibility of getting back together after they finish college.  As well, Janice unexpectedly turns up for the graduation ceremony, as she had never formally received her high school diploma.  (By this point, she had already graduated from Harvard, and was lining up a job interview at IBM.)  The series concluded with the class all receiving their diplomas.\n\nIn the series, the students often faced off against the rival [[Bronx High School of Science]]. Also, in every season, the IHP students produced the school musical. Musicals staged by the students included ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', and '' [[Hair (musical)|Hair]].'' A number of someday-famous actors made appearances on the show, including [[Brad Pitt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2012/12/03/mike-tyson-brad-pitt-had-sex-with-my-wife/|title=Mike Tyson: 'Brad Pitt had sex with my wife'|first=PageSix com|last=Staff|date=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Show open===\nThe opening of the show features various New York landmarks as well as Charlie Moore's journey to work every day. Charlie lives in a building in Hell's Kitchen occupied by a plant distributor on the first floor, who gives him a ride to the subway at 50th Street on the back of the truck before he makes his first delivery of the day. After Charlie grabs a hot dog for breakfast, he begins running into trouble as the subway station is on fire and he cannot hail any taxis to take him to the school. Forced to walk out of frustration, Charlie arrives late to class to the chagrin of Dr. Samuels but once he enters the classroom, his expression immediately brightens as he sees the students. It wouldn't be until season two that the credits include adding the names of the characters portrayed by their respective actors/actresses. After three seasons with the same opening, it was changed to a group photo of the class for season four. After Hesseman left the show, it was changed to notebook graphics for its final season.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regular characters===\n\n* Charles P. \"Charlie\" Moore &ndash; [[Howard Hesseman]] (1986&ndash;1990; Seasons 1&ndash;4) is the history and social studies teacher who teaches the honors program to intellectual geniuses and help them aim for their dreams.  \n* Billy MacGregor &ndash; [[Billy Connolly]] (1990&ndash;1991; Season 5) took over Mr. Moore's class in season 5.

Although they are gifted academically, the IHP students had plenty of problems in their personal lives, and Mr. Moore not only is there to listen, he shows an unswerving ability to get the students to solve their own problems while making it seem like they came up with the answers on their own. By Episode 6 (\"Teacher's Teacher\"), the class's original teacher Mr. Thomas ([[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) had returned to Fillmore High, seemingly ready to return to the IHP class once Mr. Moore's tenure ended. After observing Mr. Moore's unorthodox teaching methods for most of the episode (much to Charlie's chagrin, as it also made apparent how much he would miss the IHP students), Mr. Thomas ultimately reveals he had no intention to return but came to observe Mr. Moore after hearing concerns about him from Dr. Samuels.  Seeing Mr. Moore in action, Mr. Thomas gives him his blessing, leaving Mr. Moore to become their full-time teacher, knowing the IHP will be in good hands. Throughout the first season, Mr. Moore attempted to get the class involved in more than just their studies, encouraging them to play volleyball and make a music video for the school's time capsule (this marks the first foray into the fondness of ''Head of the Class'' for musical production numbers). At the same time, the class brought Mr. Moore into the present, acclimating him to the importance of personal computers. Near the end of the season, the IHP faces their Russian counterparts in an academic tournament, foreshadowing their famous trip to Moscow in season three.\n\n===Season two (1987&ndash;1988)===\nSeason two began involving the IHP in the school as a whole, with Mr. Moore involving the class in the school literary journal and encouraging a lampoon of the school newspaper.  Mr. Moore also decides to put on a school production of the musical ''Grease'', and encourages the IHP (who are initially reluctant) to participate, alongside other Fillmore students.\n\nWhile first season had some episodes that showed Charlie's personal life outside school, these become increasingly rare as the series continues.  In season 2 (and thereafter), episodes consistently focus on the lives of the IHP students, with only a very few focusing specifically on Charlie; this is the last season in which we see Charlie's apartment.\n\n===Season three (1988&ndash;1989)===\n\n====\"Mission to Moscow\"====\nIn 1988, ''Head of the Class'' broke new ground as it became the first American sitcom to be filmed in the Soviet Union and was entirely filmed in Moscow.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nThe IHP is invited to come to the country for a rematch of the academic meet that happened in season one, which ended in a tie. The class has a lot of experiences while in Moscow: Dennis and Arvid take an interest in two beautiful women, until they realize they might be [[KGB]] spies; Eric meets up with his relatives in what is a very positive experience for him; [[capitalism|capitalist]] Alan has an argument with a die-hard [[socialist]] in a store (who is also on the opposing Russian academic team); Sarah and Darlene decide to record the sights and sounds of Moscow; Simone goes to put flowers on a poet's grave and meets up with a charming Russian musician; Dr. Samuels believes that his hotel room is [[Covert listening device|bugged]], but ends up making a fool of himself; and Charlie has a brief romance with a schoolteacher.\n\nThe IHP eventually wins the meet and the respect of the Russian team. The episode concludes with both teams attending a concert in [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] swaying to the song \"Far Away Lands\" (written and performed by American [[David Pomeranz]] and Russian rock star [[Alexander Malinin|Sasha Malinin]]).\n\n===Season four (1989&ndash;1990)===\nThe fourth season saw some significant changes to the cast of characters&nbsp;\u2013 Maria, Jawaharlal and Janice left (Maria went to a performing arts school, Jawaharlal moved to California, and Janice went to Harvard as a sophomore). Several new characters took their place: Alex Torres ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]) was a Hispanic athletics student, somewhat stereotypically portrayed as having an eye for the ladies. Although Alex seemed attracted to Darlene particularly, both he and Eric competed for the affections of another new IHP student, the blonde hippie Viki Amory ([[Lara Piper]]). Another new character was aspiring filmmaker Aristotle McKenzie ([[De'voreaux White]]). T.J. Jones ([[Rain Pryor]]), a recurring character since the third season, joined the IHP in the fourth season (a remedial student with a streetwise attitude, T.J. was found to be smart enough to join the IHP). Also, the character of Jasper Kwong ([[Jonathan Ke Quan]]) was added to the IHP class late in the season. The season also showed them film a two-part episode at the [[NASA Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. The students' final year of high school was split over seasons four and five. Howard Hesseman left the show after the fourth season.\n\n===Season five (1990\u20131991)===\nIn the first episode of season five, Scottish teacher Billy MacGregor ([[Billy Connolly]]) arrived to replace the departed Charlie Moore (in the first episode of the season, it is explained to the dismayed IHP students that Mr. Moore's acting career finally took off). Despite initial uncertainty and some hostility from the students, Billy proved to be a successful replacement for Charlie. He insisted that the students refer to him by his first name, and although he was more rousing and less laid-back than his predecessor, he proved to be just as wise and caring (Billy also had a habit of boisterously greeting his class every morning with the phrase, \"good morning, geniuses\", and facetiously barking to his students to, \"get out of here\", when the bell rang at the end of the class. He also taught his class in a manner more akin to a stand-up comedian than a teacher). Many episodes from this season focused on Billy having to adapt to living in America, and his attempts to romance Ms. Meara. Other aspects of Billy were his dislike of an outdated French textbook, which actually prompted one student to take a spur-of-the-moment jaunt to Paris, and his encouragement to the male students that the best way to get girls was to be themselves. The season (and the program itself) concluded with the IHP students graduating from high school. Janice Lazarotto (from seasons one&ndash;three) returned for a guest appearance in the finale, in which T.J. is named class [[valedictorian]] and the school is closed down and demolished.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Head of the Class episodes}}\n{{:List of Head of the Class episodes}}\n\n==Novel tie-in==\nOne major novelization was released, with the plotlines based on six episodes of the show.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The book makes all the chapters flow together as one story, even though they didn't happen one right after the other on the show.
