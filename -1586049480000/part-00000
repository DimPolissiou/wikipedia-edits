The [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''karyatides'' literally means \"maidens of [[Karyes|Karyai]]\", an ancient town of [[Peloponnese]]. Karyai had a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Artemis]] in her aspect of Artemis Karyatis: \"As [[Caryatis|Karyatis]] she rejoiced in the dances of the nut-tree village of Karyai, those Karyatides, who in their ecstatic round-dance carried on their heads baskets of live reeds, as if they were dancing plants\".<ref>(Kerenyi 1980 p 149)</ref>\n\nAn [[Atlas_(architecture)|atlas]] or [[telamon]] is a male version of a caryatid, i.e. a sculpted male statue serving as an architectural support.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the term are unclear. It is first recorded in the [[Latin]] form ''caryatides'' by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]. He stated in his 1st century BC work ''[[De architectura]]'' (I.1.5) that the female figures of the [[Erechtheion]] represented the punishment of the women of [[Caryae]], a town near [[Sparta]] in [[Laconia]], who were condemned to slavery after betraying [[Athens]] by siding with [[Persia]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, Vitruvius' explanation is doubtful; well before the Persian Wars, female figures were used as decorative supports in Greece<ref>Hersey, George, ''The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture'', MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998 p. 69</ref> and the ancient Near East. Whatever the origin may have been, the association of caryatids with slavery persists and is prevalent in [[Renaissance art]].<ref>''[[The Slave in European Art]]: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth Mcgrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) 2012</ref>\n\nThe ancient Caryae supposedly was one of the six adjacent villages that united to form the original township of Sparta, and the hometown of [[Menelaos]]' queen, [[Helen of Troy]]. Girls from Caryae were considered especially beautiful, tall, strong, and capable of giving birth to strong children.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA caryatid supporting a basket on her head is called a ''[[Kanephoros|canephora]]'' (\"basket-bearer\"), representing one of the maidens who carried sacred objects used at feasts of the goddesses [[Athena]] and [[Artemis]]. The Erectheion caryatids, in a shrine dedicated to an archaic king of Athens, may therefore represent priestesses of Artemis in Caryae, a place named for the \"nut-tree sisterhood\" &ndash; apparently in [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times, like other plural feminine [[toponym]]s, such as Hyrai or Athens itself.\n\nThe later male counterpart of the caryatid is referred to as a [[telamon]] (plural ''telamones'') or [[Atlas (architecture)|atlas]] (plural ''atlantes'') &ndash; the name refers to the legend of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], who bore the sphere of the heavens on his shoulders. Such figures were used on a monumental scale, notably in the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Agrigento)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] in [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]].\n\n==Ancient usage==\n[[File:Caryatid.jpg|thumb|upright|Intricate hairstyle of caryatid, displayed at the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens]]\nSome of the earliest known examples were found in the treasuries of [[Delphi]], including [[Siphnian Treasury|that of Siphnos]], dating to the 6th century BC. However, their use as supports in the form of women can be traced back even earlier, to ritual basins, ivory mirror handles from [[Phoenicia]], and draped figures from archaic Greece.\n\nThe best-known and most-copied examples are those of the six figures of the Caryatid porch of the [[Erechtheion]] on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] at Athens.  One of those original six figures, removed by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] in the early 19th century, is now in the [[British Museum]] in London.  The [[Acropolis Museum]] holds the other five figures, which are replaced onsite by replicas. The five originals that are in Athens are now being exhibited in the new Acropolis Museum, on a special balcony that allows visitors to view them from all sides. The pedestal for the caryatid removed to London remains empty. From 2011 to 2015, they were cleaned by a specially constructed [[laser beam]], which removed accumulated soot and grime without harming the marble's [[patina]].

Their bulky, intricately arranged hairstyles serve the crucial purpose of providing static support to their necks, which would otherwise be the thinnest and structurally weakest part.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also copied the Erechtheion caryatids, installing copies in the [[Forum of Augustus]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]], and at [[Hadrian's Villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]].
