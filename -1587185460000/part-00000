His seat was at [[Colcombe Castle]] near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and later at the principal historic family seat of [[Tiverton Castle]], after his mother's death. The [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay family]] had historically been an important one in the region, and the dominant force in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. However, the rise in power and influence of several [[gentry]] families and other political players, in the years leading up to Thomas' accession to the earldom, threatened the traditional dominance of the earls of Devon in the area. Much of his life was spent in armed territorial [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|struggle against his near-neighbour]], [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|Sir William Bonville]] of [[Shute, Devon|Shute]], at a time when central control over the provinces was weak. This feud forms part of the breakdown in law and order in England that led to the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nCourtenay was for a time engaged in overseas service during the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} Increasingly, however, his efforts became directed towards strengthening his position at home. He had been married off as an infant to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], placing Courtenay close to the English king's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] kinsmen. Due to this connection, Courtenay started his career as an adherent to the English court's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] party. Upon their demise in the late 1440s, he abandoned it in favour of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. When York sought the support of Courtenay's arch-enemy Bonville, Courtenay fell out of favour with him. When the Wars of the Roses broke out, he was in the party of the queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and was one of the Lancastrian commanders at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], where he was wounded.\n\nCourtenay was said to have promoted a reconciliation between the Lancastrian and Yorkist parties, but he died suddenly in 1458. The Wars of the Roses later led to the deaths and executions of all three of Courtenay's sons, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Thomas]], Henry, and [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John]], and to the eventual [[attainder]] of his titles and forfeiture of his lands. The Earldom was however revived in 1485 for his distant cousin, [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Sir Edward Courtenay]], third in descent from his great-uncle.\n\n==Youth==\nCourtenay was born on 3 May 1414,{{sfn|Nathan|1957|p=[{{google books|vno-vmV2F5sC|pg=152|plainurl=yes}} 152]}} the only surviving son of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon|Hugh Courtenay, 4th/12th Earl of Devon]] (1389 &ndash; 16 June 1422) and Anne Talbot{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} (c.1393\u20131441), sister of the renowned warrior [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]. He succeeded as '''Earl of Devon''' in 1422, at the age of eight. He may at some time before have become a [[wardship|ward]] of the all-powerful [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\nAccording to Cokayne, Courtenay was knighted on 19 May 1426 by King [[Henry VI of England]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} and on 16 December 1431, Courtenay was among an entourage of 300 who attended King Henry VI's second coronation{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}} at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\n===Majority===\nIt appears that no inquisition of proof of age, customary for a [[tenant in chief]], was taken for his father. Based on his family's history and standing and on his own position as the leading landowner of the county, probably expected to take his place as the leader of Devon society. However, his mother's longevity meant that her dower portion, including Tiverton Castle, and the other Courtenay estates which had been alienated under his father's will were not in his hands and the young Courtenay  was forced to live at Colcombe Castle, near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], very close to his enemy [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], at Shute.{{sfn|Cherry|1981}} His income of \u00a31500 p.a. was lower than that of most nobles of comparable rank.\n\n==Career==\n===Struggle with Bonville===\n{{main|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n[[File:BonvilleArms.png|thumb|200px|Arms of Bonville: ''Sable, six mullets argent pierced gules''{{sfn|Burke|1884|p=99}}]]\nThe new earl found the political situation in Devonshire increasingly stacked against his own interests as a coalition of the greater [[gentry]], led by [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], and the earl's cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]], threatened the Courtenays\u2019 traditional dominance of the county. The relationship was complicated by Bonville's second marriage in 1430 to Elizabeth Courtenay (d. 1471), Courtenay's aunt. Despite links via his wife, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], to the ascendant \"court party\" led by [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[John Beaufort, 1st Marquess of Dorset|John Beaufort, 1st earl of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset]], and by [[Margaret Holland]], daughter of the [[Earl of Kent]], Courtenay failed to rectify his situation and instead resorted to violence, beginning in 1439. With the decline of Beaufort power, Courtenay became increasingly associated with [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. Courtenay had been attacking Bonville's estates in  the summer of 1439 and the king despatched a [[Privy Councillor]], Sir [[John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton]], to extract a promise of good behavior from Courtenay, who was thereafter reluctant to attend the court in [[London]].{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=314, 448}}<ref>The pirate-soldier, Sir Hugh Courtenay, a cousin looted [[merchant vessel]]s along the coast, and led [[brigand]]s with Thomas Carminow, after a long dispute with the Earl.</ref> In 1441, Courtenay was appointed as Steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], a nearly identical post to Royal Steward for Cornwall which had been granted to Sir William Bonville in 1437, for life.{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=133, 532}} A week later in May 1441, the warrant was retracted. Disputes arose between the two which contemporary records portray as reaching the status of a [[private war]]. Two men wearing Courtenay livery attacked Sir Philip Chetwynd, a friend of Bonville, on the road to London, apparent evidence that the Council's arbitration of November 1440 had failed.<ref>The \"Arbitration\" was published on 1 April 1442.</ref>  Courtenay and Bonville were summoned before the King in December 1441, and were publicly reconciled.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|pp=165\u201366, 173\u201375}} Tensions remained however and this may have been a factor in the crown's requests to both Courtenay, who initially refused, and Bonville to serve in France, Bonville as [[seneschal]] of [[Gascony]] from 1442\u201346 and Courtenay at [[Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Calvados|Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque]] in Normandy in 1446.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|p=[{{google books|1Pw9AAAAcAAJ|pg=240|plainurl=yes}} 240]}} This is one of the few times that Courtenay served abroad, for he had refused in March 1443, seemingly preferring to spend his time bolstering his position in Devon or at court. While Bonville was abroad, the King released Devon from his debts, including the [[recognisance]] for good behaviour, probably remitted by the influence of father-in-law, John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicolas|1y=1835|1p=408|2a1=Public Record Office|2y=1937|2p=396}}\n\n==Royal appointments==\n===Commissions===\nHis advantageous marriage to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]] brought him links to the \"court party\", and Courtenay began to be selected by the king to serve on Westcountry commissions and was granted an annuity of \u00a3100 for his services.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=315}}\n\n===Other===\n1445 marked a fleeting high point in Courtenay's fortunes, with his appointment as High Steward of England at Queen Margaret's coronation on 25 May.{{sfn|PRO|1908|p=355}} Only the year before, March 1444, Bonville had identified himself with Suffolk, at Margaret's betrothal in Rouen.\n\n==Abandonment of Beauforts==\nThe deaths of his brother-in-law [[John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset]], in 1444, and of the leader of the party [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]], 2nd son of [[John of Gaunt]], in 1447, removed Beaufort leadership of the 'court' party, leaving [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], as the most influential figure in national politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Watts|1996}} and {{harvnb|Griffiths|1981}} for differing views on the relationship between Suffolk and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].</ref> While there is no evidence of direct antagonism between Courtenay and the Duke of Suffolk, the latter appeared to favour the Bonvilles. Sir William Bonville enjoyed links with Suffolk and  married his daughter to [[William Tailboys]], one of the Duke's closest associates. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this favour was Bonville's elevation to the peerage, presumably at the direction of Suffolk, as [[Baron Bonville]] of Chewton Mendip in 1449.{{sfn|PRO|1941|p=107}}\n\n==Switch to Yorkist party==\nThis promotion of his enemy Bonville may have prompted Devon to oppose the 'Court party' and to serve with his friend [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] during [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]].  Courtenay switched allegiance to York, who with the [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] took control briefly of London. He remained loyal to York during the Parliament of November 1450, when they invoked the support of the [[Commons]] to raise taxation. Having rescued the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] from an angry London mob, York himself had to flee, taking refuge on the Earl of Devon's [[barge]] rowing down the [[Thames]].\nIt is hardly surprising that Devon began to become associated with York, who had assumed the leadership of the \"opposition\" party. The parlous state of national politics (whether the king was a vindictive factionalist or an inane non-entity is largely irrelevant in this context) combined with what seems like a reckless and violent element in Courtenay's own character, led to a further campaign of violence against Bonville and the Suffolk-aligned [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wiltshire]]. Courtenay and his troops attempted to capture Butler near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in Wiltshire before returning to besiege Bonville in [[Taunton|Taunton Castle]]. The arrival of York (whether to suppress or aid the disturbances is uncertain) caused the two sides to make peace which, unsurprisingly, had no real meaning.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=281}} York then embarked on his abortive attempt to take control of royal government by force, his only allies being Courtenay and his sometime-associate, [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham]].\n\nIn the West Country Courtenay hounded Bonville without mercy, and pursued him to [[Taunton Castle]] and laid siege to it.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=84}} York arrived to lift the siege, and imprisoned Bonville, who was nevertheless quickly released. This exploit ended with the disgrace of all three 'Yorkists' and their submission to royal mercy in March. The King had issued an arrest warrant on 24 September 1451, drafted by Somerset, to be enforced by Butler and Bonville.  The Yorkist rebellions prompted royal commissions for Buckingham and Bonville on 14 February 1452. A direct summons without delay was ordered by [[Royal Proclamation]] on 17 February to bring Courtenay and Lord Cobham to London.<ref>Lord Cobham had been dispossessed by the Earl of Wiltshire, a creation of Henry VI.ibid, 98</ref>\n\n===Treason charge===\nCourtenay was charged with [[treason]] and briefly imprisoned in [[Wallingford Castle]],{{sfn|Harriss|1965|p=216}} before appearing on trial before the [[House of Lords]]. His [[wikt:disgrace|disgrace]] and political isolation allowed his Devonshire rivals to consolidate their positions, further undermining his decreased standing in the county.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=285\u201386}} Bonville acquired all [[royal commission]]s in the south-west.\n\n== Resurgence of York ==\nKing Henry VI's madness and York's appointment as Protector in 1453/4 resulted in a partial rally in Courtenay's fortunes, including his re-appointment to commissions of the peace in the south-western counties, the key barometer of the local balance of power.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=290}} He was a member of the Royal Council until April 1454.{{sfnm|1a1=Storey|1y=1999|1p=165|2a1=Nicolas|2y=1837|2pp=189\u2013193}} Courtenay was bound over to keep the peace with a fine of 1000 marks, but ignored its restrictions. Threatened by the Council on 3 June, he was forced on 24 July to make a new bond.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}}\n\n==Abandonment by York==\nThis was, however, the end of Courtenay's links with York, whose increasingly tight links with the Neville earls of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] led to an alignment with Bonville away from Courtenay. This culminated in the marriage of [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington]], Bonville's grandson, to Salisbury's daughter, Katherine. Courtenay did not endear himself to Somerset either, as he and his sons repeatedly disrupted the sessions of the commissioners of the peace in Exeter during 1454/5, which did not assist Protector Somerset in promoting his role as the guardian of law and order. Courtenay was present at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], and was wounded.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} York however still considered him at least neutral as the Duke's letters addressed  to the King on the eve of battle were delivered to the king via the apparently still trusted hands of Courtenay.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=297}}\n\n==Final assault on Bonville==\nPerhaps inspired by the way the Nevilles and York had forcefully ended their respective feuds with the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Percies]] and the [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] in the battle, Courtenay returned to Devon and commenced a further campaign of violence against Bonville and his allies, who were now attached to Warwick's party. The violence began in October 1455 with the horrific murder by Courtenay allies of [[Nicholas Radford]], an eminent [[Westcountry]] lawyer,<ref>\"apprentice of the law\" Radford was a well-known local dignitary, an old man at the time; {{harvnb|PRO|1909|pp=269, 281}}</ref> Recorder of Exeter and one of Bonville's councilors. Several contemporary accounts, including the [[Paston Letters]], record this event with the ensuing mock-funeral and coronary inquest accompanied by the singing of highly inappropriate songs, in tones of shock and horror unusual during the blunted sensitivities of the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Gairdner|1897|p=351}} Among the murderers was [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]], the earl's son and later successor.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=168\u201370}} Parliament, meeting in November 1455, reported 800 horsemen and 4,000 infantry running amok across Devon. On 3 November 1455 Courtenay with his sons, Thomas Carrew of Ashwater and a considerable force of 1,000 men occupied the city of Exeter, nominally controlled by Bonville as castellan of the royal castle of Exeter, which they continued to control until 23 December 1455.<ref>{{Harvnb|Storey|1999|p=167}}; Estates of the Percy family, 89\u201396</ref> Courtenay had before warned the populace that Bonville was approaching with a 'great multitude' to sack the city. On 3 November 1455 Bonville's men setting out from  his seat at [[Old Shute House|Shute]] had looted the Earl's nearby house at [[Colcombe Castle]], [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and Bonville promised his support to the Earl's distant cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]]. Dozens of men violated consecrated ground and Radford's valuables were extracted from the cathedral and his house in Exeter was also robbed. Village-dwellers with Bonville connections were assaulted by Devon's men. [[Powderham Castle]], home to the earl's estranged cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1463), an ally of Bonville, was besieged on 15 November 1455, the earl's weaponry now including a [[Cannon|serpentine]] cannon. Bonville attempted to relieve the castle but was repulsed as the Earl threatened to batter down its walls.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=311}} Finally battle was joined directly between Bonville and Courtenay at the [[Clyst Heath#Battle of Clyst Heath (1455)|Battle of Clyst Heath]], at Clyst Bridge, just south east of Exeter on 15 December 1455. While it seems that Bonville was put to flight, the number of dead or wounded is entirely unknown. Two days later Thomas Carrew with 500 of Courtenay's retainers pillaged Shute, seizing a bounty of looted goods. Courtenay and his men left Exeter on 21 December 1455 and shortly afterwards submitted to York at [[Shaftesbury]] in Dorset. Early in December 1455 the King had dismissed Devon from the Commission of Peace, and citizens of Exeter had been instructed not to help his army of \"misrule\" in any way.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=173}}\n\n== Aftermath of Clyst Heath ==\nDevon was [[incarcerate]]d in the Tower. Originally, the government planned to bring him to trial for treason but this was abandoned once the King Henry VI returned to  sanity in February 1456, and York was removed as Protector. Courtenay was also returned to the commission of the peace for Devonshire, seemingly the work of [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret of Anjou]] who had taken personal control of the court. Courtenay had cultivated links with Queen Margaret, and an alliance was sealed by the marriage of his son and heir, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Sir Thomas Courtenay]], to the Queen's kinswoman, Marie, the daughter of [[Charles, Count of Maine]]. Despite having been banned from entering and leading armed men into Exeter and holding assemblies, 500 men under John Courtenay entered the [[High Street]] on 8 April 1456.  His rivals, Philip Courtenay and Lord Fitzwarin, were prevented from exercising commissions as [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]], and were forced to leave the city. Butler, Bonville's patron, and Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], [[Chief Justice]], arrived with a large entourage to investigate under a commission of [[oyer et terminer]]. They rejected Courtenay's  petition to have Bonville's [[sheriff|sheriffdom of Devon]] removed.<ref>Rotuli, op cit., 332</ref>  Two years later his sons, Thomas and Henry Courtenay, were absolved of the murder of Nicholas Radford.{{sfn|PRO|1910|pp=308, 393, 398}}\n\nCourtenay was restored to the bench of JPs and was made Keeper of the Park of Clarendon in February 1457,<ref>History of Commons, 1422\u20131508, vol.

His seat was at [[Colcombe Castle]] near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and later at the principal historic family seat of [[Tiverton Castle]], after his mother's death. The [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay family]] had historically been an important one in the region, and the dominant force in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. However, the rise in power and influence of several [[gentry]] families and other political players, in the years leading up to Thomas' accession to the earldom, threatened the traditional dominance of the earls of Devon in the area. Much of his life was spent in armed territorial [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|struggle against his near-neighbour]], [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|Sir William Bonville]] of [[Shute, Devon|Shute]], at a time when central control over the provinces was weak. This feud forms part of the breakdown in law and order in England that led to the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nCourtenay was for a time engaged in overseas service during the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} Increasingly, however, his efforts became directed towards strengthening his position at home. He had been married off as an infant to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], placing Courtenay close to the English king's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] kinsmen. Due to this connection, Courtenay started his career as an adherent to the English court's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] party. Upon their demise in the late 1440s, he abandoned it in favour of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. When York sought the support of Courtenay's arch-enemy Bonville, Courtenay fell out of favour with him. When the Wars of the Roses broke out, he was in the party of the queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and was one of the Lancastrian commanders at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], where he was wounded.\n\nCourtenay was said to have promoted a reconciliation between the Lancastrian and Yorkist parties, but he died suddenly in 1458. The Wars of the Roses later led to the deaths and executions of all three of Courtenay's sons, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Thomas]], Henry, and [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John]], and to the eventual [[attainder]] of his titles and forfeiture of his lands. The Earldom was however revived in 1485 for his distant cousin, [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Sir Edward Courtenay]], third in descent from his great-uncle.\n\n==Youth==\nCourtenay was born on 3 May 1414,{{sfn|Nathan|1957|p=[{{google books|vno-vmV2F5sC|pg=152|plainurl=yes}} 152]}} the only surviving son of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon|Hugh Courtenay, 4th/12th Earl of Devon]] (1389 &ndash; 16 June 1422) and Anne Talbot{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} (c.1393\u20131441), sister of the renowned warrior [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]. He succeeded as '''Earl of Devon''' in 1422, at the age of eight. He may at some time before have become a [[wardship|ward]] of the all-powerful [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\nAccording to Cokayne, Courtenay was knighted on 19 May 1426 by King [[Henry VI of England]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} and on 16 December 1431, Courtenay was among an entourage of 300 who attended King Henry VI's second coronation{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}} at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\n===Majority===\nIt appears that no inquisition of proof of age, customary for a [[tenant in chief]], was taken for his father. Based on his family's history and standing and on his own position as the leading landowner of the county, probably expected to take his place as the leader of Devon society. However, his mother's longevity meant that her dower portion, including Tiverton Castle, and the other Courtenay estates which had been alienated under his father's will were not in his hands and the young Courtenay  was forced to live at Colcombe Castle, near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], very close to his enemy [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], at Shute.{{sfn|Cherry|1981}} His income of \u00a31500 p.a. was lower than that of most nobles of comparable rank.\n\n==Career==\n===Struggle with Bonville===\n{{main|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n[[File:BonvilleArms.png|thumb|200px|Arms of Bonville: ''Sable, six mullets argent pierced gules''{{sfn|Burke|1884|p=99}}]]\nThe new earl found the political situation in Devonshire increasingly stacked against his own interests as a coalition of the greater [[gentry]], led by [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], and the earl's cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]], threatened the Courtenays\u2019 traditional dominance of the county. The relationship was complicated by Bonville's second marriage in 1430 to Elizabeth Courtenay (d. 1471), Courtenay's aunt. Despite links via his wife, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], to the ascendant \"court party\" led by [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[John Beaufort, 1st Marquess of Dorset|John Beaufort, 1st earl of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset]], and by [[Margaret Holland]], daughter of the [[Earl of Kent]], Courtenay failed to rectify his situation and instead resorted to violence, beginning in 1439. With the decline of Beaufort power, Courtenay became increasingly associated with [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. Courtenay had been attacking Bonville's estates in  the summer of 1439 and the king despatched a [[Privy Councillor]], Sir [[John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton]], to extract a promise of good behavior from Courtenay, who was thereafter reluctant to attend the court in [[London]].{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=314, 448}}<ref>The pirate-soldier, Sir Hugh Courtenay, a cousin looted [[merchant vessel]]s along the coast, and led [[brigand]]s with Thomas Carminow, after a long dispute with the Earl.</ref> In 1441, Courtenay was appointed as Steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], a nearly identical post to Royal Steward for Cornwall which had been granted to Sir William Bonville in 1437, for life.{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=133, 532}} A week later in May 1441, the warrant was retracted. Disputes arose between the two which contemporary records portray as reaching the status of a [[private war]]. Two men wearing Courtenay livery attacked Sir Philip Chetwynd, a friend of Bonville, on the road to London, apparent evidence that the Council's arbitration of November 1440 had failed.<ref>The \"Arbitration\" was published on 1 April 1442.</ref>  Courtenay and Bonville were summoned before the King in December 1441, and were publicly reconciled.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|pp=165\u201366, 173\u201375}} Tensions remained however and this may have been a factor in the crown's requests to both Courtenay, who initially refused, and Bonville to serve in France, Bonville as [[seneschal]] of [[Gascony]] from 1442\u201346 and Courtenay at [[Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Calvados|Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque]] in Normandy in 1446.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|p=[{{google books|1Pw9AAAAcAAJ|pg=240|plainurl=yes}} 240]}} This is one of the few times that Courtenay served abroad, for he had refused in March 1443, seemingly preferring to spend his time bolstering his position in Devon or at court. While Bonville was abroad, the King released Devon from his debts, including the [[recognisance]] for good behaviour, probably remitted by the influence of father-in-law, John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicolas|1y=1835|1p=408|2a1=Public Record Office|2y=1937|2p=396}}\n\n==Royal appointments==\n===Commissions===\nHis advantageous marriage to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]] brought him links to the \"court party\", and Courtenay began to be selected by the king to serve on Westcountry commissions and was granted an annuity of \u00a3100 for his services.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=315}}\n\n===Other===\n1445 marked a fleeting high point in Courtenay's fortunes, with his appointment as High Steward of England at Queen Margaret's coronation on 25 May.{{sfn|PRO|1908|p=355}} Only the year before, March 1444, Bonville had identified himself with Suffolk, at Margaret's betrothal in Rouen.\n\n==Abandonment of Beauforts==\nThe deaths of his brother-in-law [[John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset]], in 1444, and of the leader of the party [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]], 2nd son of [[John of Gaunt]], in 1447, removed Beaufort leadership of the 'court' party, leaving [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], as the most influential figure in national politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Watts|1996}} and {{harvnb|Griffiths|1981}} for differing views on the relationship between Suffolk and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].</ref> While there is no evidence of direct antagonism between Courtenay and the Duke of Suffolk, the latter appeared to favour the Bonvilles. Sir William Bonville enjoyed links with Suffolk and  married his daughter to [[William Tailboys]], one of the Duke's closest associates. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this favour was Bonville's elevation to the peerage, presumably at the direction of Suffolk, as [[Baron Bonville]] of Chewton Mendip in 1449.{{sfn|PRO|1941|p=107}}\n\n==Switch to Yorkist party==\nThis promotion of his enemy Bonville may have prompted Devon to oppose the 'Court party' and to serve with his friend [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] during [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]].  Courtenay switched allegiance to York, who with the [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] took control briefly of London. He remained loyal to York during the Parliament of November 1450, when they invoked the support of the [[Commons]] to raise taxation. Having rescued the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] from an angry London mob, York himself had to flee, taking refuge on the Earl of Devon's [[barge]] rowing down the [[Thames]].\nIt is hardly surprising that Devon began to become associated with York, who had assumed the leadership of the \"opposition\" party. The parlous state of national politics (whether the king was a vindictive factionalist or an inane non-entity is largely irrelevant in this context) combined with what seems like a reckless and violent element in Courtenay's own character, led to a further campaign of violence against Bonville and the Suffolk-aligned [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wiltshire]]. Courtenay and his troops attempted to capture Butler near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in Wiltshire before returning to besiege Bonville in [[Taunton|Taunton Castle]]. The arrival of York (whether to suppress or aid the disturbances is uncertain) caused the two sides to make peace which, unsurprisingly, had no real meaning.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=281}} York then embarked on his abortive attempt to take control of royal government by force, his only allies being Courtenay and his sometime-associate, [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham]].\n\nIn the West Country Courtenay hounded Bonville without mercy, and pursued him to [[Taunton Castle]] and laid siege to it.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=84}} York arrived to lift the siege, and imprisoned Bonville, who was nevertheless quickly released. This exploit ended with the disgrace of all three 'Yorkists' and their submission to royal mercy in March. The King had issued an arrest warrant on 24 September 1451, drafted by Somerset, to be enforced by Butler and Bonville.  The Yorkist rebellions prompted royal commissions for Buckingham and Bonville on 14 February 1452. A direct summons without delay was ordered by [[Royal Proclamation]] on 17 February to bring Courtenay and Lord Cobham to London.<ref>Lord Cobham had been dispossessed by the Earl of Wiltshire, a creation of Henry VI.ibid, 98</ref>\n\n===Treason charge===\nCourtenay was charged with [[treason]] and briefly imprisoned in [[Wallingford Castle]],{{sfn|Harriss|1965|p=216}} before appearing on trial before the [[House of Lords]]. His [[wikt:disgrace|disgrace]] and political isolation allowed his Devonshire rivals to consolidate their positions, further undermining his decreased standing in the county.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=285\u201386}} Bonville acquired all [[royal commission]]s in the south-west.\n\n== Resurgence of York ==\nKing Henry VI's madness and York's appointment as Protector in 1453/4 resulted in a partial rally in Courtenay's fortunes, including his re-appointment to commissions of the peace in the south-western counties, the key barometer of the local balance of power.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=290}} He was a member of the Royal Council until April 1454.{{sfnm|1a1=Storey|1y=1999|1p=165|2a1=Nicolas|2y=1837|2pp=189\u2013193}} Courtenay was bound over to keep the peace with a fine of 1000 marks, but ignored its restrictions. Threatened by the Council on 3 June, he was forced on 24 July to make a new bond.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}}\n\n==Abandonment by York==\nThis was, however, the end of Courtenay's links with York, whose increasingly tight links with the Neville earls of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] led to an alignment with Bonville away from Courtenay. This culminated in the marriage of [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington]], Bonville's grandson, to Salisbury's daughter, Katherine. Courtenay did not endear himself to Somerset either, as he and his sons repeatedly disrupted the sessions of the commissioners of the peace in Exeter during 1454/5, which did not assist Protector Somerset in promoting his role as the guardian of law and order. Courtenay was present at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], and was wounded.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} York however still considered him at least neutral as the Duke's letters addressed  to the King on the eve of battle were delivered to the king via the apparently still trusted hands of Courtenay.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=297}}\n\n==Final assault on Bonville==\nPerhaps inspired by the way the Nevilles and York had forcefully ended their respective feuds with the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Percies]] and the [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] in the battle, Courtenay returned to Devon and commenced a further campaign of violence against Bonville and his allies, who were now attached to Warwick's party. The violence began in October 1455 with the horrific murder by Courtenay allies of [[Nicholas Radford]], an eminent [[Westcountry]] lawyer,<ref>\"apprentice of the law\" Radford was a well-known local dignitary, an old man at the time; {{harvnb|PRO|1909|pp=269, 281}}</ref> Recorder of Exeter and one of Bonville's councilors. Several contemporary accounts, including the [[Paston Letters]], record this event with the ensuing mock-funeral and coronary inquest accompanied by the singing of highly inappropriate songs, in tones of shock and horror unusual during the blunted sensitivities of the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Gairdner|1897|p=351}} Among the murderers was [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]], the earl's son and later successor.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=168\u201370}} Parliament, meeting in November 1455, reported 800 horsemen and 4,000 infantry running amok across Devon. On 3 November 1455 Courtenay with his sons, Thomas Carrew of Ashwater and a considerable force of 1,000 men occupied the city of Exeter, nominally controlled by Bonville as castellan of the royal castle of Exeter, which they continued to control until 23 December 1455.<ref>{{Harvnb|Storey|1999|p=167}}; Estates of the Percy family, 89\u201396</ref> Courtenay had before warned the populace that Bonville was approaching with a 'great multitude' to sack the city. On 3 November 1455 Bonville's men setting out from  his seat at [[Old Shute House|Shute]] had looted the Earl's nearby house at [[Colcombe Castle]], [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and Bonville promised his support to the Earl's distant cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]]. Dozens of men violated consecrated ground and Radford's valuables were extracted from the cathedral and his house in Exeter was also robbed. Village-dwellers with Bonville connections were assaulted by Devon's men. [[Powderham Castle]], home to the earl's estranged cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1463), an ally of Bonville, was besieged on 15 November 1455, the earl's weaponry now including a [[Cannon|serpentine]] cannon. Bonville attempted to relieve the castle but was repulsed as the Earl threatened to batter down its walls.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=311}} Finally battle was joined directly between Bonville and Courtenay at the [[Clyst Heath#Battle of Clyst Heath (1455)|Battle of Clyst Heath]], at Clyst Bridge, just south east of Exeter on 15 December 1455. While it seems that Bonville was put to flight, the number of dead or wounded is entirely unknown. Two days later Thomas Carrew with 500 of Courtenay's retainers pillaged Shute, seizing a bounty of looted goods. Courtenay and his men left Exeter on 21 December 1455 and shortly afterwards submitted to York at [[Shaftesbury]] in Dorset. Early in December 1455 the King had dismissed Devon from the Commission of Peace, and citizens of Exeter had been instructed not to help his army of \"misrule\" in any way.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=173}}\n\n== Aftermath of Clyst Heath ==\nDevon was [[incarcerate]]d in the Tower. Originally, the government planned to bring him to trial for treason but this was abandoned once the King Henry VI returned to  sanity in February 1456, and York was removed as Protector. Courtenay was also returned to the commission of the peace for Devonshire, seemingly the work of [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret of Anjou]] who had taken personal control of the court. Courtenay had cultivated links with Queen Margaret, and an alliance was sealed by the marriage of his son and heir, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Sir Thomas Courtenay]], to the Queen's kinswoman, Marie, the daughter of [[Charles, Count of Maine]]. Despite having been banned from entering and leading armed men into Exeter and holding assemblies, 500 men under John Courtenay entered the [[High Street]] on 8 April 1456.  His rivals, Philip Courtenay and Lord Fitzwarin, were prevented from exercising commissions as [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]], and were forced to leave the city. Butler, Bonville's patron, and Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], [[Chief Justice]], arrived with a large entourage to investigate under a commission of [[oyer et terminer]]. They rejected Courtenay's  petition to have Bonville's [[sheriff|sheriffdom of Devon]] removed.<ref>Rotuli, op cit., 332</ref>  Two years later his sons, Thomas and Henry Courtenay, were absolved of the murder of Nicholas Radford.{{sfn|PRO|1910|pp=308, 393, 398}}\n\nCourtenay was restored to the bench of JPs and was made Keeper of the Park of Clarendon in February 1457,<ref>History of Commons, 1422\u20131508, vol.

In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com '''''The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'''''], (FoHGC) was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life FOHGC  has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nFoHGC operates in close partnership with the City Council, who owns the site. Two Councillors and the Wyke Area Manager are members of the subcommittee. The East Yorkshire Family History Society at the Carnegie Centre, Hull History Centre and Hymers College are active partners. FoHGC is a subscriber to \u2018Caring for God\u2019s Acre\u2019 and a member of the National Federation of Cemetery Friends. Over time, FoHGC have developed many links to other organisations in the City and beyond and continue to do so. We achieve this by means of an extensive communication policy, which includes the media, publications, talks and guided tours and last but not least by talking to visitors to the Cemetery as well as listening to the local community\u2019s views on the future of this special place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/|title=Friends of Hull General Cemetery - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\nIn September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from its slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquillity almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deteriorated to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flora and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city environment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (CWGC) have strict guidelines on the condition of the CWGC sites (extremely well maintained, proper access, not be overgrown, etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org/about-us|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=About the CWGC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and unfortunately, following an inspection of the Hull General Cemetery and in view of its extremley poor condition the CWGC removed and relocated the headstone in the 1960's. The FoHGC volunteers have painstaking identified the location of these graves wherever possible and marked them with a concrete poppy. They have listed them alphabetically within each War and included the details on their website. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/war-dead/|title=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=FoHGC - War Dead|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHull General Cemetery is one of the greatest historical resources that the city of Hull has. That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

2009)]]\n'''Hull General Cemetery''' was established by a private company in 1847 on Spring Bank, in the west of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England. In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com '''''The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'''''], (FoHGC) was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life FOHGC  has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nFoHGC operates in close partnership with the City Council, who owns the site. Two Councillors and the Wyke Area Manager are members of the subcommittee. The East Yorkshire Family History Society at the Carnegie Centre, Hull History Centre and Hymers College are active partners. FoHGC is a subscriber to \u2018Caring for God\u2019s Acre\u2019 and a member of the National Federation of Cemetery Friends. Over time, FoHGC have developed many links to other organisations in the City and beyond and continue to do so. We achieve this by means of an extensive communication policy, which includes the media, publications, talks and guided tours and last but not least by talking to visitors to the Cemetery as well as listening to the local community\u2019s views on the future of this special place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/|title=Friends of Hull General Cemetery - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\nIn September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from its slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquillity almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deteriorated to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flora and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city environment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (CWGC) have strict guidelines on the condition of the CWGC sites (extremely well maintained, proper access, not be overgrown, etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org/about-us|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=About the CWGC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and unfortunately, following an inspection of the Hull General Cemetery and in view of its extremley poor condition the CWGC removed and relocated the headstone in the 1960's. The FoHGC volunteers have painstaking identified the location of these graves wherever possible and marked them with a concrete poppy. They have listed them alphabetically within each War and included the details on their website. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/war-dead/|title=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=FoHGC - War Dead|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHull General Cemetery is one of the greatest historical resources that the city of Hull has. That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.
