Based on the [[2001 Formula One season]], GP4 essentially serves as a graphical and seasonal update of ''[[Grand Prix 3]]'' which had been released in 2000. The game retained the series' legendary [[physics engine]]. However it entered the market at a far less hospitable time than its three predecessors, and the game faced stiff competition from an alternative Formula One simulation from studios such as [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]].\n\n== Modifications from version 3 ==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n''Grand Prix 4'' featured a heavily revised graphics [[Game engine|engine]] and updated physics including wet weather driving that even today is considered some of the best to ever feature in a motorsport simulation. Despite this, the game still showed Crammond's oft-commented dated approach to game design.\n\n* While it is possible to play the game on a [[Local area network|LAN]], [[multiplayer]] internet gameplay was not possible, due to licensing restrictions. Some individuals managed to circumvent this limitation later using the Free Tunngle Network.\n* The locked framerate and [[CPU]]-heavy graphics were still a big issue with the series despite a completely revised graphics engine. However, the graphics engine proved to be very scalable, supporting models and textures multiple times the detail of the original shipped materials.\n* The mod community faced similar frustrations with the track format and it took fully two years before the track format was truly \"cracked\". The first add-on tracks to be released for the game included [[Shanghai International Circuit|Shanghai]], [[Istanbul Park|Istanbul]] and [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez]].\n* When the game was initially launched, it had a large number of [[Software bug|bugs]]. Many of these were addressed by a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] which was later included with the retail game, though the project was canned when Microprose closed and no further official fixes were forthcoming. To compensate for this some third party programmers addressed some of the remaining problems, and included enhancements which allowed the game to follow the updated rules of the Formula One championship.\n* Many claimed that the stated \"minimum requirements\" were set too low and that they could barely get the game to run on a significantly more powerful system.\n\nAlthough the game could be considered a relatively modest commercial success the chances of a further entry to the series could be considered slim to none because MicroProse's parent company [[Atari, SA|Infogrames]] dissolved the developer shortly after the game's release. Also, the [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]] brand's exclusive licensing deal for Formula One games rules out an update with official stats. An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] port of the title had been planned for release in late 2002 before being cancelled in October of that year.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=In the chair with Geoff Crammond |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |issue=69 |page=88}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 77/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{Cite web |title=Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 for PC Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/geoff-crammonds-grand-prix-4 |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>\n| CGM = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Grand Prix 4 |magazine=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |publisher=[[theGlobe.com]] |issue=146 |date=January 2003 |page=77}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Smolka |first=Rob |title=Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_221.pdf |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |issue=221 |date=December 2002 |page=124 |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 10/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=July 7, 2002 |title=Grand Prix 4 |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_gp4 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ajami |first=Amer |date=September 11, 2002 |title=Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 Review [date mislabeled as \"September 12, 2002\"] |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/geoff-crammonds-grand-prix-4-review/1900-2879976/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fryman |first=Avi |date=October 18, 2002 |title=GameSpy: Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/grand-prix-4/543802p1.html |website=[[GameSpy]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 8.5/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lafferty |first=Michael |date=September 16, 2002 |title=Grand Prix 4 Review |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20314.htm |website=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125041007/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20314.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.3/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Magruder |first=Randy |date=September 12, 2002 |title=Grand Prix 4 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/12/grand-prix-4-review |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=Ziff Davis |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| JXV = 15/20<ref>{{Cite web |author=Jihem |date=June 21, 2002 |title=Test: Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0000/00002214_test.htm |language=French |website=[[Jeuxvideo.com]] |publisher=Webedia |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 73%<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mahood |first=Andy |title=Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/grand_prix_4.html |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |volume=9 |issue=12 |date=December 2002 |page=98 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315132101/http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/grand_prix_4.html |archivedate=March 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| PCZone = 86%<ref>{{Cite web |last=Presley |first=Paul |date=August 5, 2002 |title=PC Review: Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=77713 |website=[[PC Zone]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630230146/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=77713 |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Grand Prix 4'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggreation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\nThe game won the award in the Sports category at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] Awards in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interactive {{!}} Games - Sport in 2002 |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2002/interactive/games-sport |website=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]}}</ref> It was also nominated for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s 2002 \"Sports Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]''.

Based on the [[2001 Formula One season]], GP4 essentially serves as a graphical and seasonal update of ''[[Grand Prix 3]]'' which had been released in 2000. The game retained the series' legendary [[physics engine]]. However it entered the market at a far less hospitable time than its three predecessors, and the game faced stiff competition from an alternative Formula One simulation from studios such as [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]].\n\n== Modifications from version 3 ==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n''Grand Prix 4'' featured a heavily revised graphics [[Game engine|engine]] and updated physics including wet weather driving that even today is considered some of the best to ever feature in a motorsport simulation. Despite this, the game still showed Crammond's oft-commented dated approach to game design.\n\n* While it is possible to play the game on a [[Local area network|LAN]], [[multiplayer]] internet gameplay was not possible, due to licensing restrictions. Some individuals managed to circumvent this limitation later using the Free Tunngle Network.\n* The locked framerate and [[CPU]]-heavy graphics were still a big issue with the series despite a completely revised graphics engine. However, the graphics engine proved to be very scalable, supporting models and textures multiple times the detail of the original shipped materials.\n* The mod community faced similar frustrations with the track format and it took fully two years before the track format was truly \"cracked\". The first add-on tracks to be released for the game included [[Shanghai International Circuit|Shanghai]], [[Istanbul Park|Istanbul]] and [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez]].\n* When the game was initially launched, it had a large number of [[Software bug|bugs]]. Many of these were addressed by a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] which was later included with the retail game, though the project was canned when Microprose closed and no further official fixes were forthcoming. To compensate for this some third party programmers addressed some of the remaining problems, and included enhancements which allowed the game to follow the updated rules of the Formula One championship.\n* Many claimed that the stated \"minimum requirements\" were set too low and that they could barely get the game to run on a significantly more powerful system.\n\nAlthough the game could be considered a relatively modest commercial success the chances of a further entry to the series could be considered slim to none because MicroProse's parent company [[Atari, SA|Infogrames]] dissolved the developer shortly after the game's release. Also, the [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]] brand's exclusive licensing deal for Formula One games rules out an update with official stats. An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] port of the title had been planned for release in late 2002 before being cancelled in October of that year.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=In the chair with Geoff Crammond |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |issue=69 |page=88}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 77/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{Cite web |title=Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 for PC Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/geoff-crammonds-grand-prix-4 |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>\n| CGM = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Grand Prix 4 |magazine=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |publisher=[[theGlobe.com]] |issue=146 |date=January 2003 |page=77}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Smolka |first=Rob |title=Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_221.pdf |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |issue=221 |date=December 2002 |page=124 |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 10/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=July 7, 2002 |title=Grand Prix 4 |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_gp4 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ajami |first=Amer |date=September 11, 2002 |title=Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 Review [date mislabeled as \"September 12, 2002\"] |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/geoff-crammonds-grand-prix-4-review/1900-2879976/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fryman |first=Avi |date=October 18, 2002 |title=GameSpy: Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/grand-prix-4/543802p1.html |website=[[GameSpy]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 8.5/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lafferty |first=Michael |date=September 16, 2002 |title=Grand Prix 4 Review |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20314.htm |website=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125041007/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20314.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.3/10<ref>{{Cite web |last=Magruder |first=Randy |date=September 12, 2002 |title=Grand Prix 4 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/12/grand-prix-4-review |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=Ziff Davis |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| JXV = 15/20<ref>{{Cite web |author=Jihem |date=June 21, 2002 |title=Test: Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0000/00002214_test.htm |language=French |website=[[Jeuxvideo.com]] |publisher=Webedia |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 73%<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mahood |first=Andy |title=Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/grand_prix_4.html |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |volume=9 |issue=12 |date=December 2002 |page=98 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315132101/http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/grand_prix_4.html |archivedate=March 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| PCZone = 86%<ref>{{Cite web |last=Presley |first=Paul |date=August 5, 2002 |title=PC Review: Grand Prix 4 |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=77713 |website=[[PC Zone]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630230146/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=77713 |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Grand Prix 4'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggreation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\nThe game won the award in the Sports category at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] Awards in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interactive {{!}} Games - Sport in 2002 |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2002/interactive/games-sport |website=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]}}</ref> It was also nominated for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s 2002 \"Sports Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]''.

It is an adaptation of the play ''[[The Danton Case]]'' by [[Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska]].\n\nThe film stars [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] in the title role, with [[Wojciech Pszoniak]] as [[Maximilien Robespierre]], and [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]] as [[Camille Desmoulins]]. It was directed by the Polish director [[Andrzej Wajda]] and was an [[international co-production]] between companies in [[France]], [[Poland]] and [[West Germany]]. All supporters of Danton (with the exception of Bourdon, who would later betray him) are played by French actors, while Robespierre's allies are played by Poles. \n\nNot always rigidly historical, the film draws continual parallels between the [[Reign of Terror]] during the French Revolution and the situation in contemporary Poland, in which the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement was struggling against the oppression of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed Polish government.<ref>Liner notes on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD of the film.</ref><ref>\n[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0DC1F38F93BA1575AC0A965948260 WAJDA'S 'DANTON,' INSIDE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION By VINCENT CANBY], The New York Times, September 28, 1983 :\"In an interview in Le Monde, Mr. Wajda denies all associations between 18th-century France and 20th-century Poland\"</ref> The film had 1,392,779 admissions in France.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins in Paris in the cold spring of 1794 when the Reign of Terror is in full swing, with vehicles entering the city being searched and long lines of citizens grumbling in the rain as they wait to buy scarce bread. Ill in his flat, Robespierre sees Danton in the street, just returned from the country and being acclaimed by the hungry and dispirited people as their hero. \n\nWhen H\u00e9ron, head of the secret police, calls round, Robespierre instructs him to destroy the print shop of Desmoulins, who is publishing pro-Danton circulars. While Robespierre is being tended by his barber, his friend Saint-Just comes in and urges him to have Danton guillotined. He ignores him and goes to a meeting of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], the effective government of France, where other members also push for the elimination of Danton. Robespierre resists, because Danton is so popular with the ordinary people and is his friend. \n\nBefore that day's sitting of the [[National Convention]], the legislative assembly of the country, General Westermann discusses with Danton a coup to overthrow the tyranny of Robespierre and the Committee. Danton disapproves, even though friends warn him that Robespierre is planning to have him jailed and he should strike first. Danton is positive that the influence of his newspaper, [[Le Vieux Cordelier]], and the support of the people will keep him safe. However, he asks his supporter Bourdon to denounce H\u00e9ron and his secret police in the Convention, which leads to H\u00e9ron's arrest.\n\nThat night, Danton asks Robespierre to an elaborate dinner in a private room of a restaurant, fortifying himself in advance with copious wine. Robespierre refuses to eat and insists on a serious talk. He asks Danton to join his cause and stop fighting him, because he does not want to be forced to have Danton executed. Danton simply carries on drinking and refuses all Robespierre\u2019s advances. After Robespierre has left in disgust, in the street Danton meets a group of armed men who turn out to be part of Westermann's preparations for a coup. Once again, Danton refuses to join their illegal venture. \n\nRobespierre, having failed with Danton, then goes to the house of Desmoulins, who is furious that his printing business has been destroyed and refuses to talk to him. Robespierre tries to convince him that Danton is exploiting him, but is ignored. Desmoulins' wife begs Robespierre to stay and talk sense into her husband, because she wants him to live, but Robespierre can achieve nothing. He goes to the Committee of Public Safety and orders a warrant for the arrest that night of Danton, Desmoulins, Westermann and several of their associates. Though Danton could still rally support, he does not want to cause more bloodshed and accepts arrest, claiming that his oratory and the affection of the people will protect him.\n\nAt the National Convention in the  morning, members are outraged at the arrests, but Robespierre simply justifies his action by stating that Danton is an enemy of the Republic and must be tried regardless of his popularity. Having escaped arrest, Bourdon hastily changes sides and backs Robespierre. When the trial opens before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], only seven jurors can be found who will agree to vote Danton guilty but it continues regardless. Danton keeps breaking order to address the spectators, and the prosecutor Fouquier is unhappy because he has insufficient grounds for a conviction. Back in prison that night, Danton's confidence is shaken when another prisoner tells him how overjoyed he is to hear that Danton, the first president of the Committee and the creator of the Revolutionary Tribunal, is to be executed. \n\nNext day, while visiting the studio of the painter David, Robespierre is told by Fouquier that Danton's constant interruptions are making a farce of the trial, which lacks validity anyhow. Robespierre gets the Committee to issue a decree that anyone who speaks out of turn will be removed from court. Within minutes, all the accused have been bundled out and the verdict of guilty is read.\n\nOn the day before their execution Danton is depressed, not because of his death but because he feels that he has failed the people. Once the condemned men have been taken through the silent crowds to the scaffold and guillotined, Robespierre's long-maintained tension breaks and he relapses into shock. The noble ideals of the Revolution in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], recited to him by a child forced to learn it by heart, are fatally compromised.\n\n== Principal cast ==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Georges Danton]]\n* [[Wojciech Pszoniak]] as [[Maximilien Robespierre]]\n* [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]] as [[Camille Desmoulins]]\n* [[Bogus\u0142aw Linda]] as [[Louis de Saint-Just]]\n* [[Angela Winkler]] as [[Lucile Duplessis|Lucile Desmoulins]]\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis Bourdon]]\n* [[Serge Merlin]] as [[Pierre Philippeaux]]\n* [[Roland Blanche]] as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delacroix]]\n* [[Jacques Villeret]] as [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Westermann]]\n* [[Anne Alvaro]] as [[\u00c9l\u00e9onore Duplay]]\n* [[Roger Planchon]] as [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville]]\n* [[Franciszek Starowieyski]] as [[Jacques-Louis David]]\n* Alain Mac\u00e9 as Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9ron\n\n==Reception==\nThe film had been sponsored by France's first socialist government for decades, in anticipation of the bicentenary of the Revolution in 1989. Before its release, a private showing to the President of the Republic, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], and the Minister of Culture, [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], evoked a frosty reaction. They had not expected such a cynical tale of power politics, show trials and cold-blooded judicial murder, familiar though it all was in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]] under Soviet control.<ref>{{cite|first = Philippe|last = d'Hugues|article = Danton remis en cause par Andrzej Wajda |title = La Nouvelle Revue d'histoire|volume = 89|date = March 2017|page = 61}}</ref><ref>{{cite|first = Laurent |last = Dandrieu |title =  Dictionnaire passionn\u00e9 du cin\u00e9ma |publisher = L'Homme Nouveau |year = 2013|page = 76}}</ref> \n\n==Awards==\n* Prix Louis-Delluc 1982: Andrzej Wajda\n* C\u00e9sar 1983, Best director: Andrzej Wajda\n* BAFTA  Awards 1983, [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Foreign Language Film]]: Danton\n* Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival 1983, Best Actor: G\u00e9rard Depardieu & Wojciech Pszoniak\n* National Society of Film Critics Awards, USA 1983, Best Actor: G\u00e9rard Depardieu\n* Polish Film Festival 1984: Andrzej Wajda\n* London Critics Circle Film Awards 1984, Director of the Year: Andrzej Wajda\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Allmovie title|12215}}\n* {{IMDb title|0083789}}\n* 1983 review by Vincent Canby at [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0DC1F38F93BA1575AC0A965948260  nytimes.com]\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1072-danton-the-worst-of-times ''Danton: The Worst of Times''] an essay by Leonard Quart at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Andrzej Wajda}}\n{{BAFTA Best Foreign Language Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Danton 1983}}\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1980s biographical films]]\n[[Category:1980s historical films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:French historical films]]\n[[Category:Polish films]]\n[[Category:French-language films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about Georges Danton]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Georges Danton]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Maximilien Robespierre]]\n[[Category:Political drama films]]\n[[Category:French films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andrzej Wajda]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film BAFTA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Director C\u00e9sar Award]]\n[[Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:French Revolution films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Danton\n| image          = DantonPoster.jpg\n| caption        = Film poster\n| director       = [[Andrzej Wajda]]\n| producer       = [[Margaret M\u00e9n\u00e9goz]]<br />Barbara Pec-Slesicka\n| writer         = [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]<br />collaboration with<br>[[Andrzej Wajda]]<br>[[Agnieszka Holland]]<br>Boles\u0142aw Micha\u0142ek<br>Jacek G\u0105siorowski \n| narrator       = \n| starring       = [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]]\n| music          = [[Jean Prodromid\u00e8s]]\n| cinematography = Igor Luther\n| editing        = Halina Prugar-Ketling\n| distributor    = [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]\n| released       = {{Film date|df=y|1983|1|12|France|1983|1|31|Poland}}\n| runtime        = 136 minutes\n| country        = France<br />Poland<br />[[West Germany|West&nbsp;Germany]]\n| language       = French\n| budget         = \n| gross          = $10.4 million<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=7057|title=Danton (1983) - JPBox-Office|first=|last=JP|website=www.jpbox-office.com}}</ref>\n}}\n'''''Danton''''' ({{IPA-fr|d\u0251\u0303t\u0254\u0303}}) is a 1983 [[French language]] film depicting the last weeks of [[Georges Danton]], one of the leaders of the [[French Revolution]].

All supporters of Danton (with the exception of Bourdon, who would later betray him) are played by French actors, while Robespierre's allies are played by Poles. \n\nNot always rigidly historical, the film draws continual parallels between the [[Reign of Terror]] during the French Revolution and the situation in contemporary Poland, in which the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement was struggling against the oppression of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed Polish government.<ref>Liner notes on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD of the film.</ref><ref>\n[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0DC1F38F93BA1575AC0A965948260 WAJDA'S 'DANTON,' INSIDE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION By VINCENT CANBY], The New York Times, September 28, 1983 :\"In an interview in Le Monde, Mr. Wajda denies all associations between 18th-century France and 20th-century Poland\"</ref> The film had 1,392,779 admissions in France.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins in Paris in the cold spring of 1794 when the Reign of Terror is in full swing, with vehicles entering the city being searched and long lines of citizens grumbling in the rain as they wait to buy scarce bread. Ill in his flat, Robespierre sees Danton in the street, just returned from the country and being acclaimed by the hungry and dispirited people as their hero. \n\nWhen H\u00e9ron, head of the secret police, calls round, Robespierre instructs him to destroy the print shop of Desmoulins, who is publishing pro-Danton circulars. While Robespierre is being tended by his barber, his friend Saint-Just comes in and urges him to have Danton guillotined. He ignores him and goes to a meeting of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], the effective government of France, where other members also push for the elimination of Danton. Robespierre resists, because Danton is so popular with the ordinary people and is his friend. \n\nBefore that day's sitting of the [[National Convention]], the legislative assembly of the country, General Westermann discusses with Danton a coup to overthrow the tyranny of Robespierre and the Committee. Danton disapproves, even though friends warn him that Robespierre is planning to have him jailed and he should strike first. Danton is positive that the influence of his newspaper, [[Le Vieux Cordelier]], and the support of the people will keep him safe. However, he asks his supporter Bourdon to denounce H\u00e9ron and his secret police in the Convention, which leads to H\u00e9ron's arrest.\n\nThat night, Danton asks Robespierre to an elaborate dinner in a private room of a restaurant, fortifying himself in advance with copious wine. Robespierre refuses to eat and insists on a serious talk. He asks Danton to join his cause and stop fighting him, because he does not want to be forced to have Danton executed. Danton simply carries on drinking and refuses all Robespierre\u2019s advances. After Robespierre has left in disgust, in the street Danton meets a group of armed men who turn out to be part of Westermann's preparations for a coup. Once again, Danton refuses to join their illegal venture. \n\nRobespierre, having failed with Danton, then goes to the house of Desmoulins, who is furious that his printing business has been destroyed and refuses to talk to him. Robespierre tries to convince him that Danton is exploiting him, but is ignored. Desmoulins' wife begs Robespierre to stay and talk sense into her husband, because she wants him to live, but Robespierre can achieve nothing. He goes to the Committee of Public Safety and orders a warrant for the arrest that night of Danton, Desmoulins, Westermann and several of their associates. Though Danton could still rally support, he does not want to cause more bloodshed and accepts arrest, claiming that his oratory and the affection of the people will protect him.\n\nAt the National Convention in the  morning, members are outraged at the arrests, but Robespierre simply justifies his action by stating that Danton is an enemy of the Republic and must be tried regardless of his popularity. Having escaped arrest, Bourdon hastily changes sides and backs Robespierre. When the trial opens before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], only seven jurors can be found who will agree to vote Danton guilty but it continues regardless. Danton keeps breaking order to address the spectators, and the prosecutor Fouquier is unhappy because he has insufficient grounds for a conviction. Back in prison that night, Danton's confidence is shaken when another prisoner tells him how overjoyed he is to hear that Danton, the first president of the Committee and the creator of the Revolutionary Tribunal, is to be executed. \n\nNext day, while visiting the studio of the painter David, Robespierre is told by Fouquier that Danton's constant interruptions are making a farce of the trial, which lacks validity anyhow. Robespierre gets the Committee to issue a decree that anyone who speaks out of turn will be removed from court. Within minutes, all the accused have been bundled out and the verdict of guilty is read.\n\nOn the day before their execution Danton is depressed, not because of his death but because he feels that he has failed the people. Once the condemned men have been taken through the silent crowds to the scaffold and guillotined, Robespierre's long-maintained tension breaks and he relapses into shock. The noble ideals of the Revolution in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], recited to him by a child forced to learn it by heart, are fatally compromised.\n\n== Principal cast ==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Georges Danton]]\n* [[Wojciech Pszoniak]] as [[Maximilien Robespierre]]\n* [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]] as [[Camille Desmoulins]]\n* [[Bogus\u0142aw Linda]] as [[Louis de Saint-Just]]\n* [[Angela Winkler]] as [[Lucile Duplessis|Lucile Desmoulins]]\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis Bourdon]]\n* [[Serge Merlin]] as [[Pierre Philippeaux]]\n* [[Roland Blanche]] as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delacroix]]\n* [[Jacques Villeret]] as [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Westermann]]\n* [[Anne Alvaro]] as [[\u00c9l\u00e9onore Duplay]]\n* [[Roger Planchon]] as [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville]]\n* [[Franciszek Starowieyski]] as [[Jacques-Louis David]]\n* Alain Mac\u00e9 as Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9ron\n\n==Reception==\nThe film had been sponsored by France's first socialist government for decades, in anticipation of the bicentenary of the Revolution in 1989. Before its release, a private showing to the President of the Republic, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], and the Minister of Culture, [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], evoked a frosty reaction. They had not expected such a cynical tale of power politics, show trials and cold-blooded judicial murder, familiar though it all was in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]] under Soviet control.<ref>{{cite|first = Philippe|last = d'Hugues|article = Danton remis en cause par Andrzej Wajda |title = La Nouvelle Revue d'histoire|volume = 89|date = March 2017|page = 61}}</ref><ref>{{cite|first = Laurent |last = Dandrieu |title =  Dictionnaire passionn\u00e9 du cin\u00e9ma |publisher = L'Homme Nouveau |year = 2013|page = 76}}</ref> \n\n==Awards==\n* Prix Louis-Delluc 1982: Andrzej Wajda\n* C\u00e9sar 1983, Best director: Andrzej Wajda\n* BAFTA  Awards 1983, [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Foreign Language Film]]: Danton\n* Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival 1983, Best Actor: G\u00e9rard Depardieu & Wojciech Pszoniak\n* National Society of Film Critics Awards, USA 1983, Best Actor: G\u00e9rard Depardieu\n* Polish Film Festival 1984: Andrzej Wajda\n* London Critics Circle Film Awards 1984, Director of the Year: Andrzej Wajda\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Allmovie title|12215}}\n* {{IMDb title|0083789}}\n* 1983 review by Vincent Canby at [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0DC1F38F93BA1575AC0A965948260  nytimes.com]\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1072-danton-the-worst-of-times ''Danton: The Worst of Times''] an essay by Leonard Quart at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Andrzej Wajda}}\n{{BAFTA Best Foreign Language Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Danton 1983}}\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1980s biographical films]]\n[[Category:1980s historical films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:French historical films]]\n[[Category:Polish films]]\n[[Category:French-language films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about Georges Danton]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Georges Danton]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Maximilien Robespierre]]\n[[Category:Political drama films]]\n[[Category:French films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andrzej Wajda]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film BAFTA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:French Revolution films]]\n", "name_user": "Diopic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:addCategory:Films whose director won the Best Director C\u00e9sar Award", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danton_(1983_film)"}

{"title_page": "Coaling tower", "text_new": "[[File:Repton on the coaling stage, Grosmont. - geograph.org.uk - 1198262.jpg|A steel coal tower at Grosmont Motive Power Depot, United Kingdom|thumb]]\n\nA '''coaling tower''', '''coal stage''' or '''coaling station''' is a facility used to load [[coal]] as fuel into railway [[steam locomotive]]s. Coaling towers were often sited at [[motive power depot]]s or locomotive maintenance shops.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/CoalFacilities/CoalFacilitiesMenu.htm |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |title=Coal facility |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929072037/http://michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/CoalFacilities/CoalFacilitiesMenu.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCoaling towers were constructed of wood, steel-reinforced concrete, or steel. In almost all cases coaling stations used a [[gravity]] fed method, with one or more large storage bunkers for the coal elevated on columns above the railway tracks, from which the coal could be released to slide down a [[chute (gravity)|chute]] into the waiting locomotive's coal storage area. The method of lifting the bulk coal into the storage bin varied. The coal usually was dropped from a hopper car into a pit below tracks adjacent to the tower. From the pit a conveyor-type system used a chain of motor-driven buckets to raise the coal to the top of the tower where it would be dumped into the storage bin; a skip-hoist system lifted a single large bin for the same purpose.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Some facilities lifted entire railway coal trucks or wagons. Sanding pipes were often mounted on coaling towers to allow simultaneous replenishment of a locomotive's sand box.\n\nAs railroads transitioned from the use of steam locomotives to the use of [[diesel locomotive]]s in the 1950s the need for coaling towers ended. Many reinforced concrete towers remain in place if they do not interfere with operations due to the high cost of [[demolition]] incurred with these massive structures.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Existing Coaling Towers==\nThe sortable tables below list existing steam locomotive coaling towers, coal stages, coal docks, coal chutes, and automatic loaders with the following information when known:\n#Place name where the coaling tower is located.\n#State, province, or county in which the coaling tower is located.\n#Railroad for which the coaling tower was originally built.\n#Year in which the coaling tower was built.\n#Type of coaling station: tower or stage, chutes, dock, automatic loader.\n#Capacity in tons of coal which the coaling tower was built to store.\n#Builder or designer company.\n#Remarks: whether the tower is adjacent to active tracks, name of the railroad yard, similar towers, number of tracks the tower was built to serve.\n#Geographic coordinates.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bS9AAQAAMAAJ&dq=Railway%2520Age%2520Gazette%2520volume%252053&pg=PA227#v=snippet&q=Newnan&f=false|title=Railway Age Gazette, volume 53, number 5|last=|first=|date=1912-08-02|publisher=Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=228|language=en|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!State\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[Caron, Western Australia|Caron]]<ref>Basic Principles for Local Government Inventories, State Heritage Office, Government of Western Australia|website=www.cambridge.wa.gov.au|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>\n|[[Western Australia]]\n|[[Western Australian Government Railways]]\n|1931\n|Coal stage\n|\n|\n|\n|align=right|{{coord|-29.58153|116.3179|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Casino]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4806172|title=Casino Railway Precinct and Locomotive Depot {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n|[[New South Wales]]\n|\n|\n|Coal stage\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|-28.85388|153.03983|format=dms}}\n|}\n\n===Canada===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!Province\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[Aylmer]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Wabash Railroad]]\n|c1939\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|42.7803|-80.99615|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Unorganized North Algoma District#Fire River|Fire River]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Location and status uncertain, similar to Camak, Chaska, Hornepayne, Social Circle, Washago\n|align=right|{{coord|48.76814|-83.59916|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Foleyet]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|48.24784|-82.44185|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Hornepayne]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|1921\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks, similar to Camak, Chaska, Fire River, Social Circle, Washago\n|align=right|{{coord|49.22051|-84.77434|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[South River, Ontario|South River]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Grand Trunk Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|45.84464|-79.37496|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Toronto]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian Pacific Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Moved to Toronto Railway Museum, [[Roundhouse Park]]\n|align=right|{{coord|43.64137|-79.38656|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Washago]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|1936\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks, similar to Camak, Chaska, Fire River, Hornepayne, Social Circle\n|align=right|{{coord|44.74601|-79.3344|format=dms}}\n|}\n\n===Chile===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!Region\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[San Rosendo]]\n|[[B\u00edo B\u00edo Region]]\n|Ferrocarriles del Estado\n|1929\n|Coaling tower\n|450\n|\n|\n|align=right|{{coord|-37.26528|-72.72567|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Temuco]]\n|[[Araucan\u00eda Region]]\n|Ferrocarriles del Estado\n|1935\n|Coaling tower\n|3,000\n|\n|[[:es:Museo Nacional Ferroviario Pablo Neruda]]\n|align=right|{{coord|-38.72799|-72.57048|format=dms}}\n|}\n\n===Poland===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!Province\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[Gdynia|Gdynia, Grabowek]]\n|[[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomorskie]]\n|[[History of rail transport in Poland#Communist period|Polskie Koleje Pa\u0144stwowe]]\n|c1950\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|Ross & White Company\n|Construction plans and mechanisms provided by [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|UNRRA]];

Coaling towers were often sited at [[motive power depot]]s or locomotive maintenance shops.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/CoalFacilities/CoalFacilitiesMenu.htm |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |title=Coal facility |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929072037/http://michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/CoalFacilities/CoalFacilitiesMenu.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCoaling towers were constructed of wood, steel-reinforced concrete, or steel. In almost all cases coaling stations used a [[gravity]] fed method, with one or more large storage bunkers for the coal elevated on columns above the railway tracks, from which the coal could be released to slide down a [[chute (gravity)|chute]] into the waiting locomotive's coal storage area. The method of lifting the bulk coal into the storage bin varied. The coal usually was dropped from a hopper car into a pit below tracks adjacent to the tower. From the pit a conveyor-type system used a chain of motor-driven buckets to raise the coal to the top of the tower where it would be dumped into the storage bin; a skip-hoist system lifted a single large bin for the same purpose.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Some facilities lifted entire railway coal trucks or wagons. Sanding pipes were often mounted on coaling towers to allow simultaneous replenishment of a locomotive's sand box.\n\nAs railroads transitioned from the use of steam locomotives to the use of [[diesel locomotive]]s in the 1950s the need for coaling towers ended. Many reinforced concrete towers remain in place if they do not interfere with operations due to the high cost of [[demolition]] incurred with these massive structures.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Existing Coaling Towers==\nThe sortable tables below list existing steam locomotive coaling towers, coal stages, coal docks, coal chutes, and automatic loaders with the following information when known:\n#Place name where the coaling tower is located.\n#State, province, or county in which the coaling tower is located.\n#Railroad for which the coaling tower was originally built.\n#Year in which the coaling tower was built.\n#Type of coaling station: tower or stage, chutes, dock, automatic loader.\n#Capacity in tons of coal which the coaling tower was built to store.\n#Builder or designer company.\n#Remarks: whether the tower is adjacent to active tracks, name of the railroad yard, similar towers, number of tracks the tower was built to serve.\n#Geographic coordinates.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bS9AAQAAMAAJ&dq=Railway%2520Age%2520Gazette%2520volume%252053&pg=PA227#v=snippet&q=Newnan&f=false|title=Railway Age Gazette, volume 53, number 5|last=|first=|date=1912-08-02|publisher=Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=228|language=en|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!State\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[Caron, Western Australia|Caron]]<ref>Basic Principles for Local Government Inventories, State Heritage Office, Government of Western Australia|website=www.cambridge.wa.gov.au|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>\n|[[Western Australia]]\n|[[Western Australian Government Railways]]\n|1931\n|Coal stage\n|\n|\n|\n|align=right|{{coord|-29.58153|116.3179|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Casino]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4806172|title=Casino Railway Precinct and Locomotive Depot {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n|[[New South Wales]]\n|\n|\n|Coal stage\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|-28.85388|153.03983|format=dms}}\n|}\n\n===Canada===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!Province\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[Aylmer]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Wabash Railroad]]\n|c1939\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|42.7803|-80.99615|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Unorganized North Algoma District#Fire River|Fire River]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Location and status uncertain, similar to Camak, Chaska, Hornepayne, Social Circle, Washago\n|align=right|{{coord|48.76814|-83.59916|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Foleyet]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|48.24784|-82.44185|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Hornepayne]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|1921\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks, similar to Camak, Chaska, Fire River, Social Circle, Washago\n|align=right|{{coord|49.22051|-84.77434|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[South River, Ontario|South River]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Grand Trunk Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks\n|align=right|{{coord|45.84464|-79.37496|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Toronto]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian Pacific Railway]]\n|\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Moved to Toronto Railway Museum, [[Roundhouse Park]]\n|align=right|{{coord|43.64137|-79.38656|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Washago]]\n|[[Ontario]]\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|1936\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|\n|Active tracks, similar to Camak, Chaska, Fire River, Hornepayne, Social Circle\n|align=right|{{coord|44.74601|-79.3344|format=dms}}\n|}\n\n===Chile===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!Region\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[San Rosendo]]\n|[[B\u00edo B\u00edo Region]]\n|Ferrocarriles del Estado\n|1929\n|Coaling tower\n|450\n|\n|\n|align=right|{{coord|-37.26528|-72.72567|format=dms}}\n|-\n|[[Temuco]]\n|[[Araucan\u00eda Region]]\n|Ferrocarriles del Estado\n|1935\n|Coaling tower\n|3,000\n|\n|[[:es:Museo Nacional Ferroviario Pablo Neruda]]\n|align=right|{{coord|-38.72799|-72.57048|format=dms}}\n|}\n\n===Poland===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Place Name\n!Province\n!Railroad\n!Year Built\n!Type\n!Capacity (tons)\n!Builder\n!Remarks\n!Coordinates\n|-\n|[[Gdynia|Gdynia, Grabowek]]\n|[[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomorskie]]\n|[[History of rail transport in Poland#Communist period|Polskie Koleje Pa\u0144stwowe]]\n|c1950\n|Coaling tower\n|\n|Ross & White Company\n|Construction plans and mechanisms provided by [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|UNRRA]];

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

Early in the war French plans for an invasion of England failed when [[Edward III of England]] destroyed the French fleet in the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 93\u201399.</ref> Major fighting was thereafter confined to French soil and England's naval capabilities sufficed to transport armies and supplies safely to their continental destinations. However, while subsequent French invasion schemes came to nothing, England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] allies. Such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern France by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 91\u201397, 99\u2013116, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power.

This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]].

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

By the end of the war the Royal Navy comprised over 4,800 ships, and was the second largest fleet in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = (339) \u2013 Navy lists > 1913\u20131921, 1944\u20131945 \u2013 Quarterly > 1945 > July > Volume 3|url =https://digital.nls.uk/93495250|website = National Library of Scotland|access-date = 21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period and early 21st century===\n{{See also|Structure of the Royal Navy in 1989}}\nAfter the Second World War, the decline of the [[British Empire]] and the economic hardships in Britain forced the reduction in the size and capability of the Royal Navy. All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry. A modest new construction programme was initiated with some new carriers ([[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier|''Majestic''-]] and {{sclass-|Centaur|aircraft carrier|0}} light carriers, and {{sclass-|Audacious|aircraft carrier|0}} large carriers, such as {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}}, being completed between 1948 through 1958), along with three {{sclass-|Tiger|cruiser|0}} cruisers (completed 1959\u20131961), the {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer|1||1949}}s in the 1950s, and finally the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer|0}} guided missile destroyers completed in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Purvis|first=M.

The introduction of Polaris followed the cancellation of the [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] missile which had been proposed for use by the Air Force's [[V bomber]] force.

A plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers, each displacing about 60,000&nbsp;tons; the plan was designated [[CVA-01]]. These carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the Royal Navy's place as a major naval power. The new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government that came to power in 1964 was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending, and in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] the project was cancelled.<ref>Eric J. Grove, ''Vanguard to Trident'', [[Naval Institute Press]]/The Bodley Head, London, 1987</ref> The existing carriers (all built during, or just after World War II) were refitted, two ({{HMS|Bulwark|R08|2}} and {{HMS|Albion|R07|2}}) becoming ''commando'' carriers, and four ({{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, {{HMS|Eagle|R05|2}}, and {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}}) being completed or rebuilt. Starting in 1965 with {{HMS|Centaur|R06|2}}, one by one these carriers were decommissioned without replacement, culminating with the 1979 retirement of ''Ark Royal''. By the early 1980s, only {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}} survived and received a refit (just in time for the [[Falklands War]]), to operate [[Sea Harriers]]. She operated along with three much smaller {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|2}}s, and the fleet was now centred around anti-submarine warfare in the north Atlantic as opposed to its former position with worldwide strike capability. Along with the war era carriers, all of the war built cruisers and destroyers, along with the post-war built ''Tiger''-class cruisers and large County-class guided missile destroyers were either retired or sold by 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnavalships.com/directory/shipinfo.php?ShipID=894|title=HMS Antrim|publisher=World Naval Ships|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808231503/http://www.worldnavalships.com/directory/shipinfo.php?ShipID=894|archive-date=8 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy was involved in three major confrontations with the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] from 1958 to 1976.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the Royal Navy surface fleet continues to reduce in size. A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|title=Royal Navy is now 'too small' to protect Britain.|author=John Ingham|work=Express|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023222150/http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|archive-date=23 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy also took part in the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo conflict]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan Campaign]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the last of which saw RN warships [[Naval Gunfire Support|bombard]] positions in support of the [[Al Faw Peninsula]] landings by [[Royal Marines]]. In August 2005, the Royal Navy rescued seven Russians stranded in a submarine off the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. The Navy's [[Scorpio 45]] remote-controlled mini-sub freed the Russian submarine from the fishing nets and cables that had held it for three days.

Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role. For example, the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|D32|}} displays the pennant number 'D32'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |title=HMS Daring |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=15 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913114641/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |archive-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Ranks, rates, and Insignia==\n{{See also|Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy ratings rank insignia}}\nThe Royal Navy ranks, rates and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Navy.

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105\u2013106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain\u2019s Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

Early in the war French plans for an invasion of England failed when [[Edward III of England]] destroyed the French fleet in the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 93\u201399.</ref> Major fighting was thereafter confined to French soil and England's naval capabilities sufficed to transport armies and supplies safely to their continental destinations. However, while subsequent French invasion schemes came to nothing, England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] allies. Such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern France by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 91\u201397, 99\u2013116, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power.

This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]].

Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the [[Industrial Revolution]], the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|title=How did Britain come to rule the waves?|publisher=History Extra|accessdate=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307054023/https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Warrior armoured frigate 9,137 tons, Royal Navy (first armour-plated, iron-hulled warship.)

The Navy's [[Northern Patrol]] closed off access to the [[North Sea]], while the [[Dover Patrol]] closed off access to the [[English Channel]]. The Navy also mined the North Sea. As well as closing off the Imperial German Navy's access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from [[German Empire|Germany]]. The blockade was maintained during the eight months after the armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>Osbourne, Eric W. (2004).

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the Royal Navy surface fleet continues to reduce in size. A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|title=Royal Navy is now 'too small' to protect Britain.|author=John Ingham|work=Express|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023222150/http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|archive-date=23 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy also took part in the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo conflict]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan Campaign]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the last of which saw RN warships [[Naval Gunfire Support|bombard]] positions in support of the [[Al Faw Peninsula]] landings by [[Royal Marines]]. In August 2005, the Royal Navy rescued seven Russians stranded in a submarine off the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. The Navy's [[Scorpio 45]] remote-controlled mini-sub freed the Russian submarine from the fishing nets and cables that had held it for three days.

The carrier ''Ark Royal'' and the remaining Type 22 frigates were all removed from service and sold for scrap. {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}} however, was retained through to 2014 in the [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPH]] role, until ''Ocean'' completed her refit.

Navies of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries [[Commonwealth realm|where the British monarch is also head of state]] include their national name, e.g. [[Royal Australian Navy]]. Some navies of other monarchies, such as the ''Koninklijke Marine'' ([[Royal Netherlands Navy]]) and ''Kungliga Flottan'' ([[Royal Swedish Navy]]), are also called \"Royal Navy\" in their own language. The Danish Navy stands out with the term Royal incorporated in its official name (Royal Danish Navy), but only using the term \"Fl\u00e5den\" (Navy) in everyday speech.<ref>most books on the subject of the Royal Danish Navy</ref> The French Navy, despite France being a republic since 1870, is often nicknamed ''\"La Royale\"'' (literally: The Royal).<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jean|last=Randier|year=2006|title=La Royale : L'histoire illustr\u00e9e de la Marine nationale fran\u00e7aise|isbn=978-2-35261-022-9}}</ref>\n\n===Of ships===\n{{Main|List of ships of the Royal Navy}}\n{{See also|List of active Royal Navy ships|Naming conventions for destroyers of the Royal Navy|Type system of the Royal Navy}}\nRoyal Navy ships in commission are prefixed since 1789 with [[Her Majesty's Ship]] ([[His Majesty's Ship]]), abbreviated to \"HMS\"; for example, {{HMS|Beagle}}. Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role. For example, the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|D32|}} displays the pennant number 'D32'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |title=HMS Daring |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=15 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913114641/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |archive-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Ranks, rates, and Insignia==\n{{See also|Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy ratings rank insignia}}\nThe Royal Navy ranks, rates and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Navy.
