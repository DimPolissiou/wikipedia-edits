Lewis opened the first store in what was then called Darlington Mills. The store was purchased in about 1824 by Charles Bowman (for whom the town was eventually named) who then established the first post office.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thickson|first=J.|title=History of West Durham Region|newspaper=Bowmanville Statesman|date=March 3, 1832}}</ref> Its first postmaster was Robert Fairbairn, who ran the post office from 1828 to 1857.

It was a station of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]]. It was established on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It possessed a good harbour and there was extensive water power in the vicinity. The surrounding country was fertile.<ref>The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869</ref>\n\nThe success of the Vanstone Mill, fueled by the machinery of the Crown's land grant program, led to the rapid expansion of the Bowmanville settlement in the early years of the 19th century. Under the generous yet discriminate eyes of wealthy local merchants such as John Simpson and Charles Bowman, small properties would often be sold to promote settlement and small business. The town soon developed a balanced economy; all the while gradually establishing itself as a moderate player in shipping, rail transport, metal works and common minor business (including tanneries, liveries, stables and everyday mercantile commodity exchange).\n\nBy the time of [[Confederation of Canada|Confederation]], Bowmanville was a vital, prosperous and growing town, home to a largely [[Scottish people|Scots]]-[[Presbyterian]] community with all manner of farmers, working, and professional class making the town their home. With local economic stability and accessible, abundant land available for the construction of housing, the town soon sported several new churches, each designated to house both [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Free and Auld Kirk]], [[Anglican]] and Protestant congregations, including the [[Bible Christian Church]], later to be a major stream of Canadian [[Methodism]].\n\nAt present, St. John's Anglican Church. St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, St. Paul's [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] and the impressively ornate Trinity United Church (site of an old Auld Kirk church) still serve the community. All of these edifices, appropriately, lie on or are in close proximity to present-day Church Street.\n\n[[File:Downtown_Bowmanville_-_King_St.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Bowmanville]]\n\nIn the 19th century, in 1857, the Ontario Bank was founded in Bowmanville, with local resident John Simpson as its first president. The bank, while appearing to be a local enterprise, was primarily controlled by 16 Montreal businessmen. The Ontario bank eventually opened local branches including locations in Whitby, Oshawa, and Port Hope. In 1874, it was moved to Toronto, and would later become insolvent as a result of investing in speculative stocks in 1906.<ref>Humber, William.\"A Small Town On The Edge\".

Goodyear even went so far as to provide affordable housing for its employees, and present day Carlisle Ave. (built by Goodyear president W.C. Carlisle) in the 1910s still stands as one of Ontario's best preserved examples of industrial housing. The land on which the Bowmanville Hospital was built was donated by J.W. Alexander, the owner of the then-prospering Dominion Organ and Piano factory.\n\nFormal education evolved in-step with Ryersonian philosophies of the day, and the advent of the Central Public School (1889) and the Bowmanville High School (1890), (both designed by Whitby architect A.A. Post) were the finishing touches to the town that was a model of then-Ontario Premier [[Oliver Mowat]]'s philosophy of education, expansion and innovation for the citizens of the province.\n\nThe 20th century saw a steady rise in the construction of area schools, with Vincent Massey P.S. (1955); St. Joseph Catholic Elementary (1962, 2000 at present site); Waverly  P.S. (1978); Dr. Ross Tilley P.S. (1993); St. Elizabeth Catholic Elementary (1998); John M. James P.S. (1999); Harold Longworth P.S. (2003); and Holy Family Catholic Elementary School (2007), all accommodating gradual population increases and building developments in specific demographic areas of the town. The local school board was amalgamated with neighboring jurisdictions to form the [[Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board]] in 1997. The Catholic schools are part of the [[Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board]] which had already merged  four municipalities in 1969 (at that time it was named the Peterborough, Victoria, Northumberland, and Newcastle Separate School Board).\n\nAs the town grew and prospered, so arrived Bowmanville's grand era of architectural building and refinement. Many excellently maintained specimens of Italianate, Gothic Revival, Colonial Brick and Queen Anne architecture remain in Bowmanville's older central neighborhoods. Much of Bowmanville's residential and commercial architectural heritage was either lost or threatened by demolition and modern development from 1950 to 1980, but a 25-year renaissance in appreciation and awareness (led largely by local historians and LACAC members) helped to preserve the precious remnants of days gone by.\n\nBowmanville was incorporated as a village in 1852 and as a town in 1858.  In 1974, the town was amalgamated with neighbouring [[Clarke Township, Ontario|Clarke Township]] and [[Darlington Township, Ontario|Darlington Township]] to form the '''Town of Newcastle''' which in turn was renamed the '''Municipality of Clarington''' in 1994.\n\nSubdivided housing developments first arrived in the 1950s, with a significant increase in housing development through the 1980s and 1990s. The population rose to about 10,000 in the 1970s, about 20,000 in the 1980s, about 25,000 in the 1990s and today is about 35,000. Transportation improvements in the 1980s included a widening of Highway 401 (first built through Bowmanville in 1952) to six lanes and of Highway 2 to 4/5 lanes. Many have referred to this as the \"Lane Era\" of Bowmanville.\n\n===Prisoner of war camp===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Bowmanville POW camp|Camp 30]], the Lake Ontario Officers' Camp-Bowmanville, held captive German army officers from the Afrika Korps, fliers from the Luftwaffe and naval officers from the  Kriegsmarine. Farms surrounded the camp that had been a delinquent boys' school prior to the war. In several accounts by former POWs, the prison was represented as very humane, in that the prisoners were well treated and well fed.\n\nAmong the German officers transferred from England to Bowmanville was Korvettenkapit\u00e4n [[Otto Kretschmer]], who was the top U-boat ace of World War II. Kretschmer assumed the duties of the senior naval officer, sharing the command with the senior Luftwaffe officer Oberstleutnant Hans Hefele and the senior army officer General Leutnant Hans von Ravenstein.\n\nThe Bowmanville boys' school had been quickly turned into a POW camp by surrounding the existing school buildings with a barbed wire fence. The facility, which had been designed to house 300 boys, was cramped and undersized for grown men. Two {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} fences with electric lights every twelve feet and nine guard towers surrounded the {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. The fence had sixty miles of barbed wire looped around the small perimeter. Lieutenant Colonel R.O. Bull M.C. had a support staff plus the Veterans Guard of Canada, consisting of nine officers and 239 other ranks under his command to guard the prisoners.\n\nWhen the naval prisoners arrived at Bowmanville, there were no recreational facilities. The naval officers quickly transformed the camp. Flower and vegetable gardens were planted, sports fields, tennis courts and a swimming pool were built. The quarters were expanded, giving the prisoners better living conditions. The prisoners received money from home or earned extra money by manufacturing wooden furniture. They were able to purchase beer, cigarettes and dry goods from [[Eaton's]] mail order catalogue. It was an ideal life except that there were no women and no freedom. For some there was the urge to get back to the war and defend their country, and for others a desire to remain POWs for the duration of the war.\n\nA daily routine of exercise, sporting events and work assignments was established. As well as English being taught, professors from the nearby University of Toronto gave lectures for university credit classes. A school was also formed, which taught midshipmen seamanship and navigation courses.\n\nCurrent movies were shown each week. National and religious holidays were observed, and music concerts were given regularly. Elaborate stage plays were produced. Extraordinary puppets were designed and fabricated for puppet shows. Although the conditions were good in the Canadian POW camps, there was very little to do, and the routine was always the same.\n\n===The Battle of Bowmanville===\n\nIn October 1942, between 150 and 400 prisoners revolted against the POW guards after they were shackled as retribution as part of the escalation of Germany's new Commando Order.\n\nLt.Col. James Taylor had asked German senior officer Georg Friemel to supply 100 prisoners to volunteer to be shackled as part of the ongoing international dispute. When he refused, Otto Kretschmer and Hans Hefele were also asked to provide volunteers, but refused.\n\nTaylor ordered the guards to find 100 officers to be shackled by force, and Horst Elfe, Kretschmer and others barricaded themselves in the mess hall, arming themselves with sticks, iron bars and other makeshift weapons. Approximately 100 Canadian soldiers requisitioned from another base arrived, and together stormed the mess hall using only baseball bats, so the two sides remained evenly matched. After several hours of brawling, the Canadians brought high pressure water hoses and soaked the cabin thoroughly until the prisoners agreed to come out peacefully.\n\nDuring later incidents in the battle which spanned several days, Volkmar K\u00f6nig was wounded by gunfire and another bayoneted, and a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier suffered a skull fracture from a thrown jar of jam. After calm had returned, 126 of the prisoners were transferred to other camps.\n\n==Geography==\nBowmanville is surrounded by rural areas on three sides, and [[Lake Ontario]] to the south. Farmland formerly covered central Bowmanville until the population increased, thus establishing a nascent downtown core by the early 19th century.

The Eagles did not have success at the Jr A level until approximately 2004. They had moderate success from there until 2010. The Jr. A league decided it needed to contract some clubs and unfortunately the Eagles were one of the clubs on the contraction list.\n\nIn their inaugural season back as a Junior C club, the Eagles won the Central Ontario League Championship. The Eagles won playoff rounds over Uxbridge, Little Britain and Lakefield.  In the Provincial round of the playoffs the Eagles went up against the Campbellford Rebels of the Empire Jr C league where they lost out in seven games.\n\nBowmanville is the home of the Clarington Tigercats - Durham Knights Football Club which was founded in 1999.\n\nIn 1997 the Oshawa Green Gaels lacrosse franchise moved to Clarington.

Under the generous yet discriminate eyes of wealthy local merchants such as John Simpson and Charles Bowman, small properties would often be sold to promote settlement and small business. The town soon developed a balanced economy; all the while gradually establishing itself as a moderate player in shipping, rail transport, metal works and common minor business (including tanneries, liveries, stables and everyday mercantile commodity exchange).\n\nBy the time of [[Confederation of Canada|Confederation]], Bowmanville was a vital, prosperous and growing town, home to a largely [[Scottish people|Scots]]-[[Presbyterian]] community with all manner of farmers, working, and professional class making the town their home. With local economic stability and accessible, abundant land available for the construction of housing, the town soon sported several new churches, each designated to house both [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Free and Auld Kirk]], [[Anglican]] and Protestant congregations, including the [[Bible Christian Church]], later to be a major stream of Canadian [[Methodism]].\n\nAt present, St. John's Anglican Church. St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, St. Paul's [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] and the impressively ornate Trinity United Church (site of an old Auld Kirk church) still serve the community. All of these edifices, appropriately, lie on or are in close proximity to present-day Church Street.\n\n[[File:Downtown_Bowmanville_-_King_St.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Bowmanville]]\n\nIn the 19th century, in 1857, the Ontario Bank was founded in Bowmanville, with local resident John Simpson as its first president. The bank, while appearing to be a local enterprise, was primarily controlled by 16 Montreal businessmen. The Ontario bank eventually opened local branches including locations in Whitby, Oshawa, and Port Hope. In 1874, it was moved to Toronto, and would later become insolvent as a result of investing in speculative stocks in 1906.<ref>Humber, William.\"A Small Town On The Edge\".

Goodyear even went so far as to provide affordable housing for its employees, and present day Carlisle Ave. (built by Goodyear president W.C. Carlisle) in the 1910s still stands as one of Ontario's best preserved examples of industrial housing. The land on which the Bowmanville Hospital was built was donated by J.W. Alexander, the owner of the then-prospering Dominion Organ and Piano factory.\n\nFormal education evolved in-step with Ryersonian philosophies of the day, and the advent of the Central Public School (1889) and the Bowmanville High School (1890), (both designed by Whitby architect A.A. Post) were the finishing touches to the town that was a model of then-Ontario Premier [[Oliver Mowat]]'s philosophy of education, expansion and innovation for the citizens of the province.\n\nThe 20th century saw a steady rise in the construction of area schools, with Vincent Massey P.S. (1955); St. Joseph Catholic Elementary (1962, 2000 at present site); Waverly  P.S. (1978); Dr. Ross Tilley P.S. (1993); St. Elizabeth Catholic Elementary (1998); John M. James P.S. (1999); Harold Longworth P.S. (2003); and Holy Family Catholic Elementary School (2007), all accommodating gradual population increases and building developments in specific demographic areas of the town. The local school board was amalgamated with neighboring jurisdictions to form the [[Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board]] in 1997. The Catholic schools are part of the [[Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board]] which had already merged  four municipalities in 1969 (at that time it was named the Peterborough, Victoria, Northumberland, and Newcastle Separate School Board).\n\nAs the town grew and prospered, so arrived Bowmanville's grand era of architectural building and refinement. Many excellently maintained specimens of Italianate, Gothic Revival, Colonial Brick and Queen Anne architecture remain in Bowmanville's older central neighborhoods. Much of Bowmanville's residential and commercial architectural heritage was either lost or threatened by demolition and modern development from 1950 to 1980, but a 25-year renaissance in appreciation and awareness (led largely by local historians and LACAC members) helped to preserve the precious remnants of days gone by.\n\nBowmanville was incorporated as a village in 1852 and as a town in 1858.  In 1974, the town was amalgamated with neighbouring [[Clarke Township, Ontario|Clarke Township]] and [[Darlington Township, Ontario|Darlington Township]] to form the '''Town of Newcastle''' which in turn was renamed the '''Municipality of Clarington''' in 1994.\n\nSubdivided housing developments first arrived in the 1950s, with a significant increase in housing development through the 1980s and 1990s. The population rose to about 10,000 in the 1970s, about 20,000 in the 1980s, about 25,000 in the 1990s and today is about 35,000. Transportation improvements in the 1980s included a widening of Highway 401 (first built through Bowmanville in 1952) to six lanes and of Highway 2 to 4/5 lanes. Many have referred to this as the \"Lane Era\" of Bowmanville.\n\n===Prisoner of war camp===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Bowmanville POW camp|Camp 30]], the Lake Ontario Officers' Camp-Bowmanville, held captive German army officers from the Afrika Korps, fliers from the Luftwaffe and naval officers from the  Kriegsmarine. Farms surrounded the camp that had been a delinquent boys' school prior to the war. In several accounts by former POWs, the prison was represented as very humane, in that the prisoners were well treated and well fed.\n\nAmong the German officers transferred from England to Bowmanville was Korvettenkapit\u00e4n [[Otto Kretschmer]], who was the top U-boat ace of World War II. Kretschmer assumed the duties of the senior naval officer, sharing the command with the senior Luftwaffe officer Oberstleutnant Hans Hefele and the senior army officer General Leutnant Hans von Ravenstein.\n\nThe Bowmanville boys' school had been quickly turned into a POW camp by surrounding the existing school buildings with a barbed wire fence. The facility, which had been designed to house 300 boys, was cramped and undersized for grown men. Two {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} fences with electric lights every twelve feet and nine guard towers surrounded the {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. The fence had sixty miles of barbed wire looped around the small perimeter. Lieutenant Colonel R.O. Bull M.C. had a support staff plus the Veterans Guard of Canada, consisting of nine officers and 239 other ranks under his command to guard the prisoners.\n\nWhen the naval prisoners arrived at Bowmanville, there were no recreational facilities. The naval officers quickly transformed the camp. Flower and vegetable gardens were planted, sports fields, tennis courts and a swimming pool were built. The quarters were expanded, giving the prisoners better living conditions. The prisoners received money from home or earned extra money by manufacturing wooden furniture. They were able to purchase beer, cigarettes and dry goods from [[Eaton's]] mail order catalogue. It was an ideal life except that there were no women and no freedom. For some there was the urge to get back to the war and defend their country, and for others a desire to remain POWs for the duration of the war.\n\nA daily routine of exercise, sporting events and work assignments was established. As well as English being taught, professors from the nearby University of Toronto gave lectures for university credit classes. A school was also formed, which taught midshipmen seamanship and navigation courses.\n\nCurrent movies were shown each week. National and religious holidays were observed, and music concerts were given regularly. Elaborate stage plays were produced. Extraordinary puppets were designed and fabricated for puppet shows. Although the conditions were good in the Canadian POW camps, there was very little to do, and the routine was always the same.\n\n===The Battle of Bowmanville===\n\nIn October 1942, between 150 and 400 prisoners revolted against the POW guards after they were shackled as retribution as part of the escalation of Germany's new Commando Order.\n\nLt.Col. James Taylor had asked German senior officer Georg Friemel to supply 100 prisoners to volunteer to be shackled as part of the ongoing international dispute. When he refused, Otto Kretschmer and Hans Hefele were also asked to provide volunteers, but refused.\n\nTaylor ordered the guards to find 100 officers to be shackled by force, and Horst Elfe, Kretschmer and others barricaded themselves in the mess hall, arming themselves with sticks, iron bars and other makeshift weapons. Approximately 100 Canadian soldiers requisitioned from another base arrived, and together stormed the mess hall using only baseball bats, so the two sides remained evenly matched. After several hours of brawling, the Canadians brought high pressure water hoses and soaked the cabin thoroughly until the prisoners agreed to come out peacefully.\n\nDuring later incidents in the battle which spanned several days, Volkmar K\u00f6nig was wounded by gunfire and another bayoneted, and a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier suffered a skull fracture from a thrown jar of jam. After calm had returned, 126 of the prisoners were transferred to other camps.\n\n==Geography==\nBowmanville is surrounded by rural areas on three sides, and [[Lake Ontario]] to the south. Farmland formerly covered central Bowmanville until the population increased, thus establishing a nascent downtown core by the early 19th century. There is a harbour to the south of Bowmanville in Port Darlington.\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Bowmanville has a [[humid continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=994866&cityname=Bowmanville+Mostert%2C+Ontario%2C+Canada&units=|title=Bowmanville, Ontario Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Unlike many other locations on similar latitudes on the eastern half of the North American continent the winters are relatively mild, with cold extremes being moderated by the proximity to Lake Ontario.

The hockey team was admitted as a Junior C Hockey Club playing in the Central Ontario Junior C League. The Eagles were a Junior C team in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Eagles applied and were accepted to the Junior A level in 1995. The Eagles were a powerhouse team in the 1980s winning the Charles Schmalz Cup (Provincial Jr C Championship) in 1982.  They won the Central Ontario Championships in 1981, 82, 84, 85, 92, 93 and 94.\n\nIn their final season as a Jr. C team before moving to Jr. A, the Eagles went to the Schmalz Cup Final. The Eagles did not have success at the Jr A level until approximately 2004. They had moderate success from there until 2010. The Jr. A league decided it needed to contract some clubs and unfortunately the Eagles were one of the clubs on the contraction list.\n\nIn their inaugural season back as a Junior C club, the Eagles won the Central Ontario League Championship. The Eagles won playoff rounds over Uxbridge, Little Britain and Lakefield.  In the Provincial round of the playoffs the Eagles went up against the Campbellford Rebels of the Empire Jr C league where they lost out in seven games.\n\nBowmanville is the home of the Clarington Tigercats - Durham Knights Football Club which was founded in 1999.\n\nIn 1997 the Oshawa Green Gaels lacrosse franchise moved to Clarington. They play out of the Garnet B Rickard complex. Since relocating to Clarington in 97 the Gaels have been one of the most dominant lacrosse franchises in the Jr B loop.

Deposited with the unnamed baby is a note asking the unknown finder to take good care of her and a bag containing clues to the parents' identity. The trio sets out to find the baby's parents. The baby is named {{nihongo|Kiyoko|\u6e05\u5b50}} by Hana, based on the Japanese translation of ''[[Silent Night]]'' literally meaning \"pure child\", as she is found on [[Christmas Eve]]. \n\nOutside a [[cemetery]], the group encounters a high-ranking [[yakuza]] boss trapped under his car. The man happens to know the owner of the club where Kiyoko's mother used to work; his daughter is going to be marrying the club's owner that day. At the wedding reception, the groom tells them that the baby's mother is a former bar girl named Sachiko. He gives them Sachiko's address, but the party is interrupted when a maid, revealed to be a Latin American [[Contract killing|hitman]] in disguise, attempts to shoot the bride's father. The hitman kidnaps Miyuki and baby Kiyoko while holding them hostage at gunpoint and takes them back to his home. There, Miyuki befriends the hitman's wife-(who also has a baby of her own) and shows her some pictures of her family.\n\nHana searches for Miyuki and Kiyoko while Gin takes care of an elderly homeless man who is dying in the street. After giving Gin a little red bag, the old man peacefully passes away. Some teenagers show up and beat up Gin and the dead old man's corpse. Meanwhile, Hana finds the girls and they go off to find a place to stay.\n\nThey go to Angel Tower, Hana's former club where the latter used to work until Hana got fired for attacking an intoxicated customer for insulting her. Gin, who was rescued by another member of the club, is also there. The trio sets out to find Sachiko's house, but they discover that it has been torn down. They are informed of the unhappy relationship between Sachiko and her husband, who is a gambling alcoholic. The group rests at a store until they are told to leave by the clerk. Hana collapses, and is taken by Gin and Miyuki to the hospital. Once at the hospital, Gin finds his estranged daughter, who is also named Kiyoko, working as a nurse. Hana berates Gin in front of his daughter and storms out of the hospital, with Miyuki following behind with baby Kiyoko in hand.\n\nHana and Miyuki find Sachiko about to jump off a bridge. Sachiko insists that her husband got rid of the baby without her knowledge, and that they return the baby to her. Meanwhile, Gin finds Sachiko's husband, who confirms a TV report Gin saw earlier that Kiyoko was actually stolen by Sachiko from the hospital. They chase after Sachiko and Kiyoko. After an intense car chase, Miyuki chases Sachiko to the top of a building. Sachiko reveals she became pregnant in hopes it would bring her closer to her husband. When her baby was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]], she decided to kidnap Kiyoko from the hospital's nursery, thinking, in her grief, the baby was hers. As Sachiko is about to jump off the building intending to commit suicide with Kiyoko in her hands, her husband comes out of his apartment, located just across the street, and begs her to start over with him. Sachiko jumps off nevertheless, but Miyuki manages to catch her before she falls, but then Sachiko accidentally drops Kiyoko. Hana jumps off the building after Kiyoko, catches the baby, and lands safely due to a miraculous gust of wind.\n\nHana, Miyuki, and Gin are taken to the hospital. Miyuki hands Gin his cigarettes and drops the old man's small red bag on the floor, revealing a winning [[lottery]] ticket. Kiyoko's real parents want to ask the trio to become her godparents.

However, a huge cache of AK-47's and [[RDX]], which were to be used for the attacks, was recovered from [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] in 2006, thus leading to the dismantling of the original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to [[Pakistan]] and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for the attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from [[Karachi]], but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks.

According to Abu Hamza, the attacks were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47's and [[RDX]], which were to be used for the attacks, was recovered from [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] in 2006, thus leading to the dismantling of the original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to [[Pakistan]] and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for the attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from [[Karachi]], but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters.

Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]], [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40/A]], and [[New York City Transit Authority|NYCT]]-operated [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44]] cars, and most [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32]] and [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] cars. The R160s are very similar to the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]]<nowiki/>s, but the two-car types cannot run together in the same train. The biggest difference between them is the [[New Technology Train#FIND%20displays|FIND (Flexible Information and Notice Display)]] system on the R160s in place of static [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] maps on the R143s.\n\nIn total, 1,662 cars comprise the R160 class, and are split into two versions: the [[Alstom]]-built '''R160A''' and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]]-built '''R160B'''. 372 out of the 1002 R160A cars are arranged in four-car sets, known as '''R160A-1''' cars, with the remaining 630 cars in five-car sets, known as '''R160A-2''' cars. All R160B cars are in five-car sets; however, two propulsion types were used. Cars with Alstom Onix propulsion found on all R160As are known as '''R160B-1''' cars, and cars with [[Siemens]] SITRAC propulsion are known as '''R160B-2''' cars.\n\nKawasaki had little to no problems in delivering the R160B cars, which entered service on August 17, 2006. Alstom was behind the delivery schedule early on for the R160As, which first ran on October 17, 2006. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] exercised \u201coptions\u201d for both contracts, and by June 2010, all R160 cars were in service. Numerous experimental features were added to the R160s through the 2010s. 68 R160A cars were fitted with [[communications-based train control]] (CBTC) equipment installed for service on the [[BMT Canarsie Line|Canarsie Line]] ([[L (New York City Subway service)|L]] train), and the majority of the remaining fleet is planned to have CBTC equipment installed for service on the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|Queens Boulevard Line]] ([[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], [[F (New York City Subway service)|F]], [[M (New York City Subway service)|M]] and [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] trains).\n\n==Description==\n{{stack|float=right|\n[[File:R160 End Route Display.JPG|thumb|alt=Front route display on an R160 in service on the W line|Front route display on an R160 in service on the '''W''' train]]\n[[File:R160 FIND System 2.jpg|thumb|alt=The R160 FIND system on a Coney Island-bound F train|The R160 FIND system on a Coney Island-bound '''F''' train]]\n}}\nThere are two versions of the R160: the '''R160A''' (built by Alstom, numbered 8313-8712, 9233-9802, & 9943-9974) and '''R160B''' (built by Kawasaki, numbered 8713-9232 & 9803-9942).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/compliance/pdf/supplemental-info.pdf|title=Supplementary Information for \u00a71269(d) 2012 \u2013 2017|last=|first=|date=2012|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|page=30|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> The two-car types are nearly identical to each other, and differ only in a few ways; they are interoperable and can be interchanged with each other.\n\nThe R160 cars are configured in either four-car sets or five-car sets. 372 R160A cars (8313-8652 & 9943-9974) are configured as four-car sets. All of the four-car sets are maintained at [[East New York Yard]] for the [[BMT Eastern Division]] ({{NYCS|J}}/{{NYCS|Z}}, {{NYCS|L}}, and {{NYCS|M}}). The remaining 630 R160A cars and all R160Bs are configured as five-car sets for use on other B Division services.

Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]], [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40/A]], and [[New York City Transit Authority|NYCT]]-operated [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44]] cars, and most [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32]] and [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] cars. The R160s are very similar to the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]]<nowiki/>s, but the two-car types cannot run together in the same train. The biggest difference between them is the [[New Technology Train#FIND%20displays|FIND (Flexible Information and Notice Display)]] system on the R160s in place of static [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] maps on the R143s.\n\nIn total, 1,662 cars comprise the R160 class, and are split into two versions: the [[Alstom]]-built '''R160A''' and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]]-built '''R160B'''. 372 out of the 1002 R160A cars are arranged in four-car sets, known as '''R160A-1''' cars, with the remaining 630 cars in five-car sets, known as '''R160A-2''' cars. All R160B cars are in five-car sets; however, two propulsion types were used. Cars with Alstom Onix propulsion found on all R160As are known as '''R160B-1''' cars, and cars with [[Siemens]] SITRAC propulsion are known as '''R160B-2''' cars.\n\nKawasaki had little to no problems in delivering the R160B cars, which entered service on August 17, 2006. Alstom was behind the delivery schedule early on for the R160As, which first ran on October 17, 2006. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] exercised \u201coptions\u201d for both contracts, and by June 2010, all R160 cars were in service. Numerous experimental features were added to the R160s through the 2010s. 68 R160A cars were fitted with [[communications-based train control]] (CBTC) equipment installed for service on the [[BMT Canarsie Line|Canarsie Line]] ([[L (New York City Subway service)|L]] train), and the majority of the remaining fleet is planned to have CBTC equipment installed for service on the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|Queens Boulevard Line]] ([[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], [[F (New York City Subway service)|F]], [[M (New York City Subway service)|M]] and [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] trains).\n\n==Description==\n{{stack|float=right|\n[[File:R160 End Route Display.JPG|thumb|alt=Front route display on an R160 in service on the W line|Front route display on an R160 in service on the '''W''' train]]\n[[File:R160 FIND System 2.jpg|thumb|alt=The R160 FIND system on a Coney Island-bound F train|The R160 FIND system on a Coney Island-bound '''F''' train]]\n}}\nThere are two versions of the R160: the '''R160A''' (built by Alstom, numbered 8313-8712, 9233-9802, & 9943-9974) and '''R160B''' (built by Kawasaki, numbered 8713-9232 & 9803-9942).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/compliance/pdf/supplemental-info.pdf|title=Supplementary Information for \u00a71269(d) 2012 \u2013 2017|last=|first=|date=2012|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|page=30|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> The two-car types are nearly identical to each other, and differ only in a few ways; they are interoperable and can be interchanged with each other.\n\nThe R160 cars are configured in either four-car sets or five-car sets. 372 R160A cars (8313-8652 & 9943-9974) are configured as four-car sets.
