Gradually simplifying his style, he developed an approach with key works consisting of pure [[geometric abstraction|geometric]] forms and their relationships to one another, set against minimal grounds.

His recognition spread to the West with solo exhibitions in Warsaw and Berlin in 1927.

In 1904, after the death of his father, he moved to [[Moscow]]. He studied at the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture]] from 1904 to 1910 and in the studio of [[Fedor Rerberg]] in Moscow. In 1911 he participated in the second exhibition of the group, ''[[Soyuz Molodyozhi]]'' (Union of Youth) in  [[St. Petersburg]], together with [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and, in 1912, the group held its third exhibition, which included works by [[Aleksandra Ekster]], Tatlin, and others. In the same year he participated in an exhibition by the collective, ''[[Donkey's Tail]]'' in Moscow. By that time his works were influenced by [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]], Russian avant-garde painters, who were particularly interested in Russian folk art called ''[[lubok]]''. Malevich described himself as painting in a \"Cubo-Futuristic\" style in 1912.<ref name=HF>[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn.

The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] in Paris in 1907, as all the main Russian avant-garde artists of the time (including Malevich) immediately absorbed the [[Cubism|cubist]] principles and began using them in their works. Already in the same year the [[Cubo-Futurism|Cubo-Futurist]] opera, ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with Malevich's stage-set, became a great success. In 1914 Malevich exhibited his works in the ''[[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]]'' in Paris together with [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Aleksandra Ekster]], and [[Vadym Meller|Vadim Meller]], among others.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Malevich also co-illustrated, with [[Pavel Filonov]], ''Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907\u20131914'' by [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and another work by Khlebnikov in 1914 titled ''Roar!

These prints, accompanied by captions by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and published by the Moscow-based publication house [[Segodniashnii Lubok]] (Contemporary Lubok), on the one hand show the influence of traditional folk art, but on the other are characterised by solid blocks of pure colours juxtaposed in compositionally evocative ways that anticipate his Suprematist work.<ref>Marie Gasper-Hulvat, \"''What a Boom, What a Blast'': Kazimir Malevich's War Propaganda\", [[Print Quarterly]], XXXV, no.4, December 2018, pp. 407-419 http://www.printquarterly.com/8-contents/66-contents-2018.html</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Brocard & Co. produced an eau de cologne called ''Severny''.

Some believe that the third ''Black Square'' (also at the Tretyakov Gallery) was painted in 1929 for Malevich's solo exhibition, because of the poor condition of the 1915 square. One more ''Black Square'', the smallest and probably the last, may have been intended as a diptych together with the ''[[Red Square (painting)|Red Square]]'' (though of smaller size) for the exhibition Artists of the RSFSR: 15 Years, held in Leningrad (1932). The two squares, Black and Red, were the centerpiece of the show. This last square, despite the author's note ''1913'' on the reverse, is believed to have been created in the late twenties or early thirties, for there are no earlier mentions of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/what-s-on/temp_exh/1999_2013/hm4_1_30/?lng=en|title=Hermitage Museum, '&#39;Malevich.

Malevich's assumption that a shifting in the attitudes of the [[Nomenklatura|Soviet authorities]] toward the [[Modernism|modernist]] art movement would take place after the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]'s fall from power was proven correct in a couple of years, when the government of [[Joseph Stalin]] turned against forms of abstraction, considering them a type of \"[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]\" art, that could not express social realities. As a consequence, many of his works were confiscated and he was banned from creating and exhibiting similar art.\n\nIn autumn 1930 he was arrested interrogated by the [[KGB]] in Leningrad, accused of Polish espionage, and threatened with execution.

Gradually simplifying his style, he developed an approach with key works consisting of pure [[geometric abstraction|geometric]] forms and their relationships to one another, set against minimal grounds. His ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'' (1915), a black square on white, represented the most radically abstract painting known to have been created so far<ref name=\"Chipp\">Chipp, Herschel B.

Malevich held several prominent teaching positions and received a solo show at the Sixteenth State Exhibition in Moscow in 1919. His recognition spread to the West with solo exhibitions in Warsaw and Berlin in 1927. From 1928 to 1930 he taught at the Kiev Art Institute, with [[Alexander Bogomazov]], [[Victor Palmov]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and published his articles in a Kharkiv magazine Nova Generatsia (New Generation).<ref name=\"Filevska\">Filevska, Tetiana.

Forced to abandon abstraction, he painted in a representational style in the years before his death from cancer in 1935, at the age of 56.\n\nNonetheless, his art and his writing influenced contemporaries such as [[El Lissitzky]], [[Lyubov Popova]] and [[Alexander Rodchenko]], as well as generations of later abstract artists, such as [[Ad Reinhardt]] and the [[Minimalists]]. He was celebrated posthumously in major exhibits at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (1936), the [[Solomon R.

In 1904, after the death of his father, he moved to [[Moscow]]. He studied at the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture]] from 1904 to 1910 and in the studio of [[Fedor Rerberg]] in Moscow. In 1911 he participated in the second exhibition of the group, ''[[Soyuz Molodyozhi]]'' (Union of Youth) in  [[St. Petersburg]], together with [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and, in 1912, the group held its third exhibition, which included works by [[Aleksandra Ekster]], Tatlin, and others. In the same year he participated in an exhibition by the collective, ''[[Donkey's Tail]]'' in Moscow. By that time his works were influenced by [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]], Russian avant-garde painters, who were particularly interested in Russian folk art called ''[[lubok]]''. Malevich described himself as painting in a \"Cubo-Futuristic\" style in 1912.<ref name=HF>[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn.

The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] in Paris in 1907, as all the main Russian avant-garde artists of the time (including Malevich) immediately absorbed the [[Cubism|cubist]] principles and began using them in their works. Already in the same year the [[Cubo-Futurism|Cubo-Futurist]] opera, ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with Malevich's stage-set, became a great success. In 1914 Malevich exhibited his works in the ''[[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]]'' in Paris together with [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Aleksandra Ekster]], and [[Vadym Meller|Vadim Meller]], among others.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Malevich also co-illustrated, with [[Pavel Filonov]], ''Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907\u20131914'' by [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and another work by Khlebnikov in 1914 titled ''Roar!

These prints, accompanied by captions by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and published by the Moscow-based publication house [[Segodniashnii Lubok]] (Contemporary Lubok), on the one hand show the influence of traditional folk art, but on the other are characterised by solid blocks of pure colours juxtaposed in compositionally evocative ways that anticipate his Suprematist work.<ref>Marie Gasper-Hulvat, \"''What a Boom, What a Blast'': Kazimir Malevich's War Propaganda\", [[Print Quarterly]], XXXV, no.4, December 2018, pp. 407-419 http://www.printquarterly.com/8-contents/66-contents-2018.html</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Brocard & Co. produced an eau de cologne called ''Severny''.

In 1915\u20131916 he worked with other Suprematist artists in a peasant/artisan [[co-operative]] in [[Skoptsi]] and [[Verbovka]] village. In 1916\u20131917 he participated in exhibitions of the [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] group in Moscow together with [[Nathan Altman]], [[David Burliuk]], [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and others.

Some believe that the third ''Black Square'' (also at the Tretyakov Gallery) was painted in 1929 for Malevich's solo exhibition, because of the poor condition of the 1915 square. One more ''Black Square'', the smallest and probably the last, may have been intended as a diptych together with the ''[[Red Square (painting)|Red Square]]'' (though of smaller size) for the exhibition Artists of the RSFSR: 15 Years, held in Leningrad (1932). The two squares, Black and Red, were the centerpiece of the show. This last square, despite the author's note ''1913'' on the reverse, is believed to have been created in the late twenties or early thirties, for there are no earlier mentions of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/what-s-on/temp_exh/1999_2013/hm4_1_30/?lng=en|title=Hermitage Museum, '&#39;Malevich.

Malevich's assumption that a shifting in the attitudes of the [[Nomenklatura|Soviet authorities]] toward the [[Modernism|modernist]] art movement would take place after the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]'s fall from power was proven correct in a couple of years, when the government of [[Joseph Stalin]] turned against forms of abstraction, considering them a type of \"[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]\" art, that could not express social realities. As a consequence, many of his works were confiscated and he was banned from creating and exhibiting similar art.\n\nIn autumn 1930 he was arrested interrogated by the [[KGB]] in Leningrad, accused of Polish espionage, and threatened with execution.

It is famous for its [[Sufi]] shrines.\n\n==Early history==\n\nAncient name of Multan was Kashep Puri. The town was built by [[Raja Kashep]( Sage Kashyap of Hindu Mythology). After  Hurnakas ( Sanskrit Hiranyakashyap the son of Sage Kashyap),  his son Parhilaad (who was saved by Vishnu by incarnating himself in form of \"Narsimha\") succeeded the throne and the town was then named after him as Parhilaad Puri. The current name Multan was given due to [[Mali (Sanskrit Malla) people]] who were inhabitted there at the time when Alexander invaded India.

[[Padshah]] (emperor) Akbar established at Multan one of his original twelve [[subah]]s (imperial top-level provinces) roughly covering Punjab, bordering Kabul, Lahore, (Old) Delhi, Ajmer, Thatta (Sindh) subahs, the Persian [[Safavid empire]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and shortly Qandahar subah.\n\nUnder the [[Mughal Empire]], Multan enjoyed over 200 years of peace, and became known as ''Dar al-Aman'' (Abode of Peace). The Khakwani [[Nawabs of Multan]] gave it a lot of financial stability and growth to the local farming sector. It was at this time that Multan was ruled by Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan Khakwani. As governor of Multan, he built the famous Mosque Ali Mohammad Khan in 1757 which remains to this day. Many buildings were constructed in this time, and agricultural production grew rapidly. The Khakwani Nawabs of Multan at this time were paying homage to the Afghan king but due to lack of power in Delhi and Kabul they had free rein and were the de facto absolute rulers of Multan. Multan at that time included areas which are part of Vehari, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan districts. The city escaped the destruction brought [[Sack of Delhi|upon India]] by the armies of [[Nadir Shah]]. Afterwards it was ruled from [[Kabul]] by numerous Afghan dynasties for a while, including by [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]], who, in 1750, appointed a Hindu [[Subahdar]] Malik Banwari Lal (Vijh) to administer Multan (and later Shujabaad and Pak Pattan). For the majority of its medieval history, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Multan region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]]. After the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] invaded and occupied Multan.\n\n==Maratha Empire==\n{{Main|Maratha conquest of North-west India}}\nIn 1758, the [[Maratha Empire]]'s general [[Raghunathrao]] marched onwards, conquered [[Lahore]] and [[Attock]] and defeated [[Timur Shah Durrani]], the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali.

[[Jhanda Singh Dhillon]] and [[Ganda Singh Dhillon]] two brothers and great warriors attacked again in 1764. However, attempts to take the Multan fort failed and they retreated after collecting several million rupees loot from the ruler Shuja Khan Saddozai. Bhangu Sikhs attacked Multan many times and finally captured the city by defeating Shuja khan Sadozai who was the governor of Multan on 22 Dec 1772. Shuja khan fled to [[Shujabad]] and died there.

However, the rise of the [[Mongol]]s would again give it some independence, albeit requiring it to be vigilant against Mongol raids from Central Asia.\n\nThe Qarmatians came to Multan in the 10th century and were expelled in 1175 by [[Muhammad of Ghor|Sultan Muhammad Ghori]].\n\n== Mughal era ==\nThe [[Mughals]] controlled the Punjabi region from 1524 until around 1739. [[Padshah]] (emperor) Akbar established at Multan one of his original twelve [[subah]]s (imperial top-level provinces) roughly covering Punjab, bordering Kabul, Lahore, (Old) Delhi, Ajmer, Thatta (Sindh) subahs, the Persian [[Safavid empire]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and shortly Qandahar subah.\n\nUnder the [[Mughal Empire]], Multan enjoyed over 200 years of peace, and became known as ''Dar al-Aman'' (Abode of Peace). The Khakwani [[Nawabs of Multan]] gave it a lot of financial stability and growth to the local farming sector. It was at this time that Multan was ruled by Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan Khakwani. As governor of Multan, he built the famous Mosque Ali Mohammad Khan in 1757 which remains to this day. Many buildings were constructed in this time, and agricultural production grew rapidly. The Khakwani Nawabs of Multan at this time were paying homage to the Afghan king but due to lack of power in Delhi and Kabul they had free rein and were the de facto absolute rulers of Multan. Multan at that time included areas which are part of Vehari, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan districts. The city escaped the destruction brought [[Sack of Delhi|upon India]] by the armies of [[Nadir Shah]]. Afterwards it was ruled from [[Kabul]] by numerous Afghan dynasties for a while, including by [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]], who, in 1750, appointed a Hindu [[Subahdar]] Malik Banwari Lal (Vijh) to administer Multan (and later Shujabaad and Pak Pattan). For the majority of its medieval history, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Multan region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]]. After the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] invaded and occupied Multan.\n\n==Maratha Empire==\n{{Main|Maratha conquest of North-west India}}\nIn 1758, the [[Maratha Empire]]'s general [[Raghunathrao]] marched onwards, conquered [[Lahore]] and [[Attock]] and defeated [[Timur Shah Durrani]], the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali.

The Sadozais having gained the favour of the king and having the Khakwani Nawab removed. This period saw the rise of [[Sikh]] power, who attacked Multan, killing the Sadozai Nawab, took over the city. The Khakwanis had moved out of the city at that time and lived in small walled cities around main Multan.\n\nThe  Khokhars and Khatri Muslims occupied Multan intermittently between 1756 and 1763 displacing replacing ruling Sadozai member by Khakwani nawab or his brother, son or even son-in-law, this was most turbulent period in history of Multan resulting administration getting paralyzed and inviting attack from [[Bhangi Misl]] from Gujranwal. [[Jhanda Singh Dhillon]] and [[Ganda Singh Dhillon]] two brothers and great warriors attacked again in 1764. However, attempts to take the Multan fort failed and they retreated after collecting several million rupees loot from the ruler Shuja Khan Saddozai. Bhangu Sikhs attacked Multan many times and finally captured the city by defeating Shuja khan Sadozai who was the governor of Multan on 22 Dec 1772. Shuja khan fled to [[Shujabad]] and died there. Afghans recaptured the city in 1880 and rule of Bhangi Sikhs ended.\n[[Image:Old City building multan.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|The front view of an old colonial building built during the rule of the [[British Raj]].]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the Sikh ruler Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] with his capital at [[Lahore]] occupied Multan. Sikh armies under General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] defeated the ruler of Multan, Muzaffar Khan Saddozai. The death of Muzaffar Khan was in fact the death of Muslim rule in Multan. Ranjit Singh reinstated Malik Mohanlal (Vijh), a descendant of Malik Banwari Lal (Vijh) who was [[Subahdar]] of Multan during Ahmed Shah Durrani's rule, as Subahdar, and appointed his younger brother Malik Sewa Ram as a [https://wiki.fibis.org/w/Mughal_Empire#Vakil Vakil] in Lahore.

During this time, Sardar Karan Narain's son became an icon during the British Raj and was awarded titles 'Rai Bahadur' and Knighted 'Sir' by Her Majesty. The British built some rail routes to the city, but its industrial capacity was never fully developed.\n\n==Post-independence==\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Multan. It initially lacked industry, hospitals and universities. Since then, there has been some industrial growth, and the city's population is continually growing. Today, it is one of the country's largest urban centres and remains an important settlement in the [[Southern Punjab]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fateh Daud]]\n*[[Dewan Mulraj]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Multan}}\n\n[[Category:History of Multan| 01]]\n[[Category:History of Punjab, Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Multan District]]\n", "name_user": "196.207.107.66", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEarly history)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Multan"}
