Realism and Nationalism 1852\u20131871. Read Books. p. 118.</ref>\n\nProudhon, who was born in [[Besan\u00e7on]], was a printer who taught himself [[Latin]] in order to better print books in the language. His best-known assertion is that \"[[property is theft!]]\", contained in his first major work, ''[[What Is Property?|What Is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government]]'' (''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement''), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of [[Karl Marx]], who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's ''The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty'' with the provocatively titled ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]''. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxist]] wings of the [[International Working Men's Association]]. Some such as [[Edmund Wilson]] have contended that Marx's attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter's defense of [[Karl Gr\u00fcn]], whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon's work.\n\nProudhon favored [[Workers' council|workers' associations]] or [[co-operatives]] as well as individual worker/peasant possession over private ownership or the [[nationalization]] of land and workplaces. He considered [[social revolution]] to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In ''The Confessions of a Revolutionary'', Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist [[Circle-A|circled-A]] symbol, today \"one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape\".<ref>Marshall, Peter.

His mother Catherine Simonin was from Cordiron.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p1\"/> Claude-Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine had five boys together, two of whom died at a very young age. Proudhon's brothers Jean-Etienne and Claude were born in 1811 and 1816 respectively and both maintained a very close relationship with Proudhon.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p3\"/>\n\nAs a boy, he mostly worked in the family tavern, helped with basic agricultural work and spent time playing outdoors in the countryside. Proudhon received no formal education as a child, but he was taught to read by his mother, who had him spelling words by age three. However, the only books that Proudhon was exposed to until he was 10 were the [[Gospel]]s and the [[The Four Sons of Aymon|Four Aymon Brothers]] and some local [[almanacs]]. In 1820, Proudhon's mother began trying to get him admitted into the city college in Besan\u00e7on. The family was far too poor to afford the tuition, but with the help of one of Claude-Fran\u00e7ois' former employers she managed to gain a bursary which deducted 120 francs a year from the cost. Proudhon was unable to afford books (or even shoes) to attend school which caused him great difficulties and often made him the object of scorn by his wealthier classmates. In spite of this, Proudhon showed a strong will to learn and spent much time in the school library with a pile of books, exploring a variety of subjects in his free time outside of class.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp5-6\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5 5\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5}}</ref>\n\n=== Entrance into the printing trade ===\nIn 1827, Proudhon began an apprenticeship at a printing press in the house of Bellevaux in Battant. On Easter of the following year, he transferred to a press in Besan\u00e7on owned by the family of one of his schoolmates, Antoine Gauthier.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p9\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9}}</ref> Besan\u00e7on was an important center of religious thought at the time and most of the works published at Gauthier were [[ecclesiastical]] works. During the course of his work, Proudhon spent hours every day reading this Christian literature and began to question many of his long held religious beliefs which eventually led him to reject Christianity altogether.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp11-12\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11 11\u201312]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, Proudhon rose to be a corrector for the press, [[proofreading]] their publications. By 1829, he began to become more interested in social issues than religious theory. Of particular importance during this period was his encounter with [[Charles Fourier]], who in 1829 came to Gauthier as a customer seeking to publish his work ''Le Nouveau Monde Industriel et Soci\u00e9taire''. Proudhon supervised the printing of the book, which gave him ample opportunity to talk with Fourier about a variety of social and philosophical issues. These discussions left a strong impression on Proudhon and influenced him throughout his life.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p13\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13}}</ref> It was also during this time that Proudhon formed one of his closest friendships with [[Gustave Fallot]], a scholar from Monteb\u00e9liard who came from a family of wealthy French industrialists. Impressed by Proudhon's corrections of one of his Latin manuscripts, Fallot sought out his friendship and the two were soon regularly spending their evenings together discussing French literature by [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and many other authors to whom Proudhon had not been exposed during his years of theological readings.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp14-15\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14 14\u201315]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14}}</ref>\n\n=== Decision to pursue philosophy and writing ===\nIn September 1830, Proudhon became certified as a [[journeyman]] compositor. The period following this was marked by unemployment and poverty, with Proudhon travelling around France (also briefly to [[Neuch\u00e2tel]], Switzerland) where he unsuccessfully sought stable employment in printing and as a schoolteacher.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p15\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/15 15]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/15}}</ref> During this period, Fallot offered financial assistance to Proudhon if he came to Paris to study philosophy.

Proudhon began mingling amongst the circle of metropolitan scholars surrounding Fallot, but he felt out of place and uncomfortable amidst people who were both wealthier and more accustomed to scholarly debate. Ultimately, Proudhon found that he preferred to spend the majority of his time studying alone and was not fond of urban life, longing to return home to Besan\u00e7on.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p17\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/17}}</ref> The [[cholera]] outbreak in Paris granted him his wish as Fallot was struck with the illness, making him unable to financially support Proudhon any longer.

He applied for the [[Suard Pension]], a bursary that would enable him to study at the Academy of Besan\u00e7on. Proudhon was selected out of several candidates primarily due to the fact that his income was much lower than the others and the judges were extremely impressed by his writing and the level of education he had given himself while working as an artisan. Proudhon arrived in Paris towards the end of autumn in 1838.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp28-30\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/28 28\u201330]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/28}}</ref>\n\n=== Early writings ===\nIn 1839, the Academy of Besan\u00e7on held an essay competition on the subject of the utility of the celebration of Sunday in regard to hygiene, morality and the relationship of the family and the city. Proudhon's entry, titled ''De la C\u00e9l\u00e9bration du dimanche'', essentially used the essay subject as a pretext for discussing a variety of political and philosophical ideas and in it one can find the seeds of his later revolutionary ideas. Many of his ideas on authority, morality and property disturbed the essay judges at the Academy and Proudhon was only awarded the bronze medal (something in which Proudhon took pride because he felt that this was an indicator that his writing made elite academics uncomfortable).<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp39-42\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39 39\u201342]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39}}</ref> In 1840, he published his first work ''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (or ''[[What Is Property]]'').\n\nHis third memoir on property was a letter to the [[Fourierist]] writer [[Consid\u00e9rant]], published in 1842 under the title ''Warning to Proprietors''.<ref>See [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon#Bibliography|bibliography]] below.</ref> Proudhon was tried for it at Besan\u00e7on, but he was acquitted when the jury found that they could not condemn him for a philosophy that they themselves could not understand.<ref name=\"Britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon \"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\"].

Afterwards, he became connected as a kind of manager with a commercial firm in [[Lyon]], France. In 1847, he left this job and finally settled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated as a leader of innovation. In this year, he also became a [[Freemason]].<ref>Henri du Bac. '' The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon ''. New York: Sheed and Ward, 1848. p. 9.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution of 1848 ===\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|Proudhon and his children by Gustave Courbet, 1865]]\nProudhon was surprised by the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France]]. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767\u20131855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Beside Dupont de l'Eure, the provisional government was dominated by [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberals]] such as [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] (Foreign Affairs), [[Alexandre Auguste Ledryeet-Rollin]] (Interior), [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]] (Justice) and [[Auguste Burdeau]] (War) because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. As during the 1830 [[July Revolution]], the Republican-Socialist Party had set up a counter-government in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]], including [[Louis Blanc]], [[Armand Marrast]], [[Ferdinand Flocon]] and [[Alexandre Martin]].\n\nProudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849<!-- which month? -->, ''Solution du probl\u00e8me social'' (''[[Solution of the Social Problem]]''), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\nDuring the [[Second French Republic]] (1848\u20131852), Proudhon had his biggest public effect through journalism. He got involved with four newspapers, namely ''Le Repr\u00e9sentant du Peuple'' (February 1848\u2013August 1848), ''Le Peuple'' (September 1848\u2013June 1849), ''La Voix du Peuple'' (September 1849\u2013May 1850) and ''Le Peuple de 1850'' (June 1850\u2013October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical combative journalism that appealed to many French workers, but alienated others. He repeatedly criticised the government's policies and promoted reformation of credit and exchange. He tried to establish a popular bank (''Banque du peuple'') early in 1849, but despite over 13,000 people signing up (mostly workers) receipts were limited falling short of 18,000FF and the whole enterprise was essentially stillborn.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\nProudhon ran for the [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille. He was successful, in the complementary elections of 4 June 1848 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. However, he was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nIn 1848, the closing of the National Workshops provoked the [[June Days uprising]] and the violence shocked Proudhon. Visiting the barricades personally, he later reflected that his presence at the [[Bastille]] at this time was \"one of the most honorable acts of my life\", but in general during the tumultuous events of 1848 he opposed [[insurrection]] by preaching peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. Proudhon disapproved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May and June 1848, though he was sympathetic to the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionists had been forced to endure.\n\nIn Spain, Ram\u00f3n de la Sagra established the anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in La Coru\u00f1a in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anarchism|title=anarchism &#124; Definition & History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish<ref>[[George Woodcock]]. ''[[Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements]]''. p. 357</ref> and later briefly became [[President of Spain]] in 1873 while being the leader of the [[Federal Democratic Republican Party]]. According to [[George Woodcock]], \"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\".<ref>George Woodcock.

The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority, and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them.&nbsp;... What capital does to labour, and the State to liberty, the Church does to the spirit. This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy. The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body, its will and its reason.<ref>P.-J. Proudhon, ''Les confessions d'un r\u00e9volutionnaire'', (Paris: Garnier, 1851), p. 271., quoted by Max Nettlau, ''A Short History of Anarchism'', pp. 43\u201344.</ref>}}\nIn his earliest works, Proudhon analyzed the nature and problems of the capitalist economy. While deeply critical of [[capitalism]], he also objected to those contemporary socialists who advocated centralized hierarchical forms of association or state control of the economy. In a sequence of commentaries from ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), posthumously published in the ''Th\u00e9orie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (''Theory of Property'', 1863\u20131864), he declared in turn that \"property is theft\", \"property is impossible\", \"property is despotism\" and \"property is freedom\". When he said \"property is theft\", he was referring to the landowner or capitalist who he believed \"stole\" the profits from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was \"subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience\".<ref>[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, \u00a7 3 \u00b6 5].</ref>\n\nIn asserting that property is freedom, he was referring not only to the product of an individual's labor, but to the peasant or artisan's home and tools of his trade and the income he received by selling his goods. For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property is labor. What one produces is one's property and anything beyond that is not. He advocated worker self-management and was opposed to the private ownership of the means of production. As he put it in 1848:\n{{quote|Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.&nbsp;... We are socialists&nbsp;... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership.&nbsp;... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations.&nbsp;... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic.<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>}}\n\nProudhon called himself a [[socialist]], but he opposed state ownership of capital goods in favour of ownership by workers themselves in associations. This makes him one of the first theorists of [[libertarian socialism]]. Proudhon was one of the main influences on the theory of [[workers' self-management]] (''autogestion'') in the late 19th and 20th century.\n\nProudhon strenuously rejected the ownership of the products of labor by society or the state, arguing in ''What Is Property?'' that while \"property in product&nbsp;... does not carry with it property in the means of production.<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 109.</ref>&nbsp;... The right to product is exclusive&nbsp;... the right to means is common\" and applied this to the land (\"the land is&nbsp;... a common thing\")<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 92.</ref> and workplaces (\"all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its exclusive proprietor\").<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 120.</ref> He argued that while society owned the means of production or land, users would control and run them (under supervision from society) with the \"organising of regulating societies\" in order to \"regulate the market\".<ref>Proudhon, ''Selected Writings'', p. 70.</ref>\n\n[[File:Proudhon-Grab.JPG|thumb|Proudhon's grave in Paris]]\nThis use-ownership he called \"possession\" and this economic system [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. Proudhon had many arguments against entitlement to land and capital, including reasons based on morality, economics, politics and individual liberty. One such argument was that it enabled profit, which in turn led to social instability and war by creating cycles of debt that eventually overcame the capacity of labor to pay them off. Another was that it produced \"despotism\" and turned workers into wage workers subject to the authority of a boss.\n\nIn ''What Is Property?'', Proudhon wrote:\n{{quote|Property, acting by exclusion and encroachment, while population was increasing, has been the life-principle and definitive cause of all revolutions. Religious wars, and wars of conquest, when they have stopped short of the extermination of races, have been only accidental disturbances, soon repaired by the mathematical progression of the life of nations. The downfall and death of societies are due to the power of accumulation possessed by property.}}\n\nTowards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In ''The Principle of Federation'' (1863), he modified his earlier anti-state position, arguing for \"the balancing of authority by liberty\" and put forward a decentralised \"theory of federal government\". He also defined anarchy differently as \"the government of each by himself\", which meant \"that political functions have been reduced to industrial functions, and that social order arises from nothing but transactions and exchanges\". This work also saw him call his economic system an \"agro-industrial federation\", arguing that it would provide \"specific federal arrangements&nbsp;... to protect the citizens of the federated states from capitalist and financial feudalism, both within them and from the outside\" and so stop the re-introduction of \"wage labour\". This was because \"political right requires to be buttressed by economic right\".\n\nIn the posthumously published ''Theory of Property'', he argued that \"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State\". Hence, \"Proudhon could retain the idea of property as theft, and at the same time offer a new definition of it as liberty. There is the constant possibility of abuse, exploitation, which spells theft. At the same time property is a spontaneous creation of society and a bulwark against the ever-encroaching power of the State\".<ref>Copleston, Frederick. ''Social Philosophy in France'', A History of Philosophy, Volume IX, Image/Doubleday, 1994, p. 67.</ref>\n\nHe continued to oppose both capitalist and state property. In ''Theory of Property'', he maintains: \"Now in 1840, I categorically rejected the notion of property for both the group and the individual\", but then states his new theory of property that \"property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists, with an unequaled capacity for setting itself against authority\" and the \"principal function of private property within the political system will be to act as a counterweight to the power of the State, and by so doing to insure the liberty of the individual\". However, he continued to oppose concentrations of wealth and property, arguing for small-scale property ownership associated with peasants and artisans. He still opposed private property in land: \"What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on\". In addition, he still believed that \"property\" should be more equally distributed and limited in size to that actually used by individuals, families and workers associations.<ref>Proudhon, ''Theory of Property'' in ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon''  pp. 129, 133, 135\u2013136.</ref> He supported the right of inheritance and defended \"as one of the foundations of the family and society\".<ref>Steward Edwards, Introduction to ''Selected Writings of P.J. Proudhon''.</ref> However, he refused to extend this beyond personal possessions, arguing that \"[u]nder the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour\".<ref>In [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] (ed.), ''No Gods, No Masters'', vol. 1, p. 62.</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and communism. He adopted the term [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers. In his vision, self-employed artisans, peasants and cooperatives would trade their products on the market. For Proudhon, factories and other large workplaces would be run by \"labor associations\" operating on directly democratic principles. The state would be abolished and instead society would be organized by a federation of \"free communes\" (a [[Communes of France|commune]] is a local municipality in French). In 1863, Proudhon said: \"All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization\".<ref>Du principe F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif [Principle of Federation] (1863)</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed the charging of interest and rent, but he did not seek to abolish them by law: \"I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose\".<ref>''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem'', Edited by Henry Cohen. [[Vanguard Press]], 1927.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution ===\nProudhon was a revolutionary. However, his revolution did not mean violent upheaval or civil war, but rather the transformation of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was monetary reform, combined with organising a credit bank and workers associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about the organization of society along new lines{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People}}\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nHe made no public criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] or Marxism because in Proudhon's lifetime Marx was relatively unknown. It was only after Proudhon's death that Marxism became a large movement. However, he did criticize [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian socialists]] of his period. This included the [[state socialist]] [[Louis Blanc]], of whom Proudhon said: \"Let me say to M. Blanc: you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must have a God, a religion, a dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy, distinctions, and ranks. For my part, I deny your God, your authority, your sovereignty, your judicial State, and all your representative mystifications\". It was Proudhon's book ''What Is Property?'' that convinced the young Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.\n\nIn one of his first works, ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'', Marx said: \"Not only does Proudhon write in the interest of the [[proletarian]]s, he is himself a proletarian, an ouvrier. His work is a scientific manifesto of the French proletariat\". However, Marx disagreed with Proudhon's anarchism and later published vicious criticisms of Proudhon. Marx wrote ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' as a refutation of Proudhon's ''The Philosophy of Poverty''.\n\nIn their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: \"I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/letters/46_05_17.htm|title=Proudhon to Karl Marx|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Nationalism, militarism and war ===\nProudhon opposed militarism, dictatorship and war, arguing that the \"end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century, under pain of indefinite decadence\"<ref>quoted by George Woodcock, ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 233</ref> and that the \"workers alone are capable of putting an end to war by creating [[economic equilibrium]]. This presupposes a radical revolution in ideas and morals\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 214</ref> As Robert L. Hoffman notes, ''War and Peace'' \"ends by condemning war without reservation\" and its \"conclusion [is] that war is obsolete\".<ref>''Revolutionary Justice'', pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> Marxist philosopher John Ehrenberg summarized Proudhon's position as such:\n<blockquote>If injustice was the cause of war, it followed that conflict could not be eliminated until society was reorganised along egalitarian lines. Proudhon had wanted to prove that the reign of political economy would be the reign of peace, finding it difficult to believe that people really thought he was defending militarism.<ref>''Proudhon and His Age'', p. 145.</ref></blockquote>\n\nProudhon argued that under mutualism \"[t]here will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right\".<ref>''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. 283.</ref>\n\nProudhon also rejected dictatorship, stating in the 1860s that \"what I will always be&nbsp;... a republican, a democrat even, and a socialist into the bargain\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 201.</ref> Henri de Lubac argued that in terms of Proudhon's critique of democracy \"we must not allow all this to hoodwink us. His invectives against democracy were not those of a counter-revolutionary. They were aimed at what he himself called 'the false democracy'.&nbsp;... They attacked an apparently liberal 'pseudo-democracy' which 'was not economic and social'&nbsp;... 'a Jacobinical democracy'\". Proudhon \"did not want to destroy, but complete, the work of 1789\" and while \"he had a grudge against the 'old democracy', the democracy of Robespierre and Marat\", he repeatedly contrasted it \"with a 'young democracy', which was a 'social democracy'\".<ref>''The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian of anarchism [[George Woodcock]], some positions Proudhon took \"sorted oddly with his avowed anarchism\". Woodcock cited for example Proudhon's proposition that each citizen perform one or two years militia service.<ref>George Woodcock ''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A Biography]]'', Black Rose Books, 1987, p. 128.</ref> The proposal appeared in the ''Programme Revolutionaire'', an electoral manifesto issued by Proudhon after he was asked to run for a position in the provisional government. The text reads: \"7\u00b0 'L'arm\u00e9e. \u2013 Abolition imm\u00e9diate de la conscription et des remplacements; obligation pour tout citoyen de faire, pendant un ou deux ans, le service militaire; application de l'arm\u00e9e aux services administratifs et travaux d'utilit\u00e9 publique\" (\"Military service by all citizens is proposed as an alternative to conscription and the practice of \"replacement\", by which those who could avoided such service\"). In the same document, Proudhon also described the \"form of government\" he was proposing as \"a centralization analogous with that of the State, but in which no one obeys, no one is dependent, and everyone is free and sovereign\".<ref>\"Programme r\u00e9volutionnaire.\" ''M\u00e9langes. Tome I''. Paris: Lacroix, 1868. 72, 70.</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn addition to being considered a founding father of anarchism, some have tried to link him to the extreme right. He was first used as a reference in the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', a right-wing association formed in 1911 by [[Georges Valois]] and [[Edouard Berth]]. Both had been brought together by the [[syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]], but they would tend toward a synthesis of [[socialism]] and [[nationalism]], mixing Proudhon's mutualism with [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralist nationalism]]. In 1925, Georges Valois founded the [[Faisceau]], the first fascist league, which took its name from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s ''[[fasci]]''. Historian of [[History of far-right movements in France|fascism, in particular of French fascists]], [[Zeev Sternhell]], has noted this use of Proudhon by the far-right. In ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology'', he states:\n{{quote|[T]he [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]&nbsp;... from its inception regarded the author of ''La philosophie de la mis\u00e8re'' as one of its masters.<ref>Griffiths, Richard. 2005. Continuum International Publishing Group. pp. 23\u201324.</ref> He was given a place of honour in the weekly section of the journal of the movement entitled, precisely, 'Our Masters.' Proudhon owed this place in L'Action fran\u00e7aise to what the Maurrassians saw as his antirepublicanism, his anti-Semitism, his loathing of Rousseau, his disdain for the French Revolution, democracy, and parliamentarianism: and his championship of the nation, the family, tradition, and the monarchy.}}\n\nHowever, K. Steven Vincent states that \"to argue that Proudhon was a proto-fascist suggests that one has never looked seriously at Proudhon's writings\".<ref>''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[J. Salwyn Schapiro]] argued in 1945 that Proudhon was a racist, \"a glorifier of war for its own sake\" and his \"advocacy of personal dictatorship and his laudation of militarism can hardly be equalled in the reactionary writings of his or of our day\".<ref name=\"Schapiro\">{{cite journal|author=[[J.

Robert Graham states that while Proudhon was personally racist, \"anti-semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme\".<ref>\"Introduction\", ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. xxxvi.</ref>\n\n[[Albert Meltzer]] has said that though Proudhon used the term \"anarchist\", he was not one and that he never engaged in \"anarchist activity or struggle\", but rather in \"parliamentary activity\".<ref>Albert Meltzer. Anarchism: Arguments for and Against, AK Press, 2000, p. 12.</ref>\n\nProudhon also engaged in an exchange of published letters between 1849 and 1850 with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] discussing the legitimacy of interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/FB-PJP-DOI.htm|title=Bastiat-Proudhon Debate on Interest|publisher=Praxeology.net|accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref> As [[Robert Leroux (sociologist)|Robert Leroux]] argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\".<ref>Leroux, Robert. \"Political Economy and Liberalism: The Economic Contribution of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat\", Routledge, 2011, p. 118.</ref> Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat: \"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero.

Arlington House, 1971, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== Antisemitism and sexism ===\nStewart Edwards, the editor of the ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', remarks: \"Proudhon's diaries (Carnets, ed. P. Haubtmann, Marcel Rivi\u00e8re, Paris 1960 to date) reveal that he had almost paranoid feelings of hatred against the Jews. In 1847, he considered publishing an article [[anti-Semitism|against the Jewish race]], which he said he \"hated\". The proposed article would have \"called for the expulsion of the Jews from France\". It would have stated: \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated. [[Heinrich Heine|H. Heine]], A. Weil, and others are simply secret spies; [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]], [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux|Cr\u00e9mieux]], [[Marx]], [[Fould]], evil choleric, envious, bitter men who hate us\".

His personal bigotries are disgusting and few modern anarchists would tolerate them \u2013 Namely, racism and sexism. He made some bad decisions and occasionally ranted in his private notebooks (where the worst of his anti-Semitism was expressed). While he did place his defence of the patriarchal family at the core of his ideas, they are in direct contradiction to his own libertarian and egalitarian ideas. In terms of racism, he sometimes reflected the less-than-enlightened assumptions and prejudices of the nineteenth century. While this does appear in his public work, such outbursts are both rare and asides (usually an extremely infrequent passing anti-Semitic remark or caricature). In short, \"racism was never the basis of Proudhon's political thinking\" (Gemie, 200-1) and \"anti-Semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme.\" (Robert Graham, \"Introduction\", General Idea of the Revolution, xxxvi) To quote Proudhon: \"There will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth.

''Property Is Theft! A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology''. AK Press UK: Edinburgh. p. 36.</ref>}}\n\nWhile racism was not overtly part of his political philosophy, Proudhon did express [[sexist]] beliefs. He held patriarchal views on women's nature and their proper role in the family and society at large. In his ''Carnets'' (''Notebooks''), unpublished until the 1960s, Proudhon maintained that a woman's choice was to be \"courtesan or housekeeper\". To a woman, a man is \"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\". His justification for [[patriarchy]] is men's greater physical strength and recommended that men use this greater strength to keep women in their place, saying: \"A woman does not at all hate being used with violence, indeed even being violated\". In her study of [[Gustave Courbet]], who painted the portrait of ''Proudhon and his children'' (1865), art historian Linda Nochlin points out that alongside his early articulations of anarchism Proudhon also wrote and published \"the most consistent [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract of its time, or perhaps, any other\", ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'', which \"raises all the main issues about woman's position in society and her sexuality with a paranoid intensity unmatched in any other text\".<ref>Nochlin, ''Courbet''. Thames & Hudson, 2007. p. 220, note 34).</ref>\n\nProudhon's defenses of patriarchy did not go unchallenged in his lifetime and [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] attacked Proudhon's anti-feminism as a contradiction of anarchist principles.

Realism and Nationalism 1852\u20131871. Read Books. p. 118.</ref>\n\nProudhon, who was born in [[Besan\u00e7on]], was a printer who taught himself [[Latin]] in order to better print books in the language. His best-known assertion is that \"[[property is theft!]]\", contained in his first major work, ''[[What Is Property?|What Is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government]]'' (''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement''), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of [[Karl Marx]], who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's ''The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty'' with the provocatively titled ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]''. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxist]] wings of the [[International Working Men's Association]]. Some such as [[Edmund Wilson]] have contended that Marx's attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter's defense of [[Karl Gr\u00fcn]], whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon's work.\n\nProudhon favored [[Workers' council|workers' associations]] or [[co-operatives]] as well as individual worker/peasant possession over private ownership or the [[nationalization]] of land and workplaces. He considered [[social revolution]] to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In ''The Confessions of a Revolutionary'', Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist [[Circle-A|circled-A]] symbol, today \"one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape\".<ref>Marshall, Peter.

His mother Catherine Simonin was from Cordiron.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p1\"/> Claude-Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine had five boys together, two of whom died at a very young age. Proudhon's brothers Jean-Etienne and Claude were born in 1811 and 1816 respectively and both maintained a very close relationship with Proudhon.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p3\"/>\n\nAs a boy, he mostly worked in the family tavern, helped with basic agricultural work and spent time playing outdoors in the countryside. Proudhon received no formal education as a child, but he was taught to read by his mother, who had him spelling words by age three. However, the only books that Proudhon was exposed to until he was 10 were the [[Gospel]]s and the [[The Four Sons of Aymon|Four Aymon Brothers]] and some local [[almanacs]]. In 1820, Proudhon's mother began trying to get him admitted into the city college in Besan\u00e7on. The family was far too poor to afford the tuition, but with the help of one of Claude-Fran\u00e7ois' former employers she managed to gain a bursary which deducted 120 francs a year from the cost. Proudhon was unable to afford books (or even shoes) to attend school which caused him great difficulties and often made him the object of scorn by his wealthier classmates. In spite of this, Proudhon showed a strong will to learn and spent much time in the school library with a pile of books, exploring a variety of subjects in his free time outside of class.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp5-6\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5 5\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5}}</ref>\n\n=== Entrance into the printing trade ===\nIn 1827, Proudhon began an apprenticeship at a printing press in the house of Bellevaux in Battant. On Easter of the following year, he transferred to a press in Besan\u00e7on owned by the family of one of his schoolmates, Antoine Gauthier.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p9\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9}}</ref> Besan\u00e7on was an important center of religious thought at the time and most of the works published at Gauthier were [[ecclesiastical]] works. During the course of his work, Proudhon spent hours every day reading this Christian literature and began to question many of his long held religious beliefs which eventually led him to reject Christianity altogether.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp11-12\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11 11\u201312]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, Proudhon rose to be a corrector for the press, [[proofreading]] their publications. By 1829, he began to become more interested in social issues than religious theory. Of particular importance during this period was his encounter with [[Charles Fourier]], who in 1829 came to Gauthier as a customer seeking to publish his work ''Le Nouveau Monde Industriel et Soci\u00e9taire''. Proudhon supervised the printing of the book, which gave him ample opportunity to talk with Fourier about a variety of social and philosophical issues. These discussions left a strong impression on Proudhon and influenced him throughout his life.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p13\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13}}</ref> It was also during this time that Proudhon formed one of his closest friendships with [[Gustave Fallot]], a scholar from Monteb\u00e9liard who came from a family of wealthy French industrialists. Impressed by Proudhon's corrections of one of his Latin manuscripts, Fallot sought out his friendship and the two were soon regularly spending their evenings together discussing French literature by [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and many other authors to whom Proudhon had not been exposed during his years of theological readings.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp14-15\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14 14\u201315]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14}}</ref>\n\n=== Decision to pursue philosophy and writing ===\nIn September 1830, Proudhon became certified as a [[journeyman]] compositor. The period following this was marked by unemployment and poverty, with Proudhon travelling around France (also briefly to [[Neuch\u00e2tel]], Switzerland) where he unsuccessfully sought stable employment in printing and as a schoolteacher.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p15\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/15 15]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/15}}</ref> During this period, Fallot offered financial assistance to Proudhon if he came to Paris to study philosophy.

Proudhon began mingling amongst the circle of metropolitan scholars surrounding Fallot, but he felt out of place and uncomfortable amidst people who were both wealthier and more accustomed to scholarly debate. Ultimately, Proudhon found that he preferred to spend the majority of his time studying alone and was not fond of urban life, longing to return home to Besan\u00e7on.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p17\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/17}}</ref> The [[cholera]] outbreak in Paris granted him his wish as Fallot was struck with the illness, making him unable to financially support Proudhon any longer.

He applied for the [[Suard Pension]], a bursary that would enable him to study at the Academy of Besan\u00e7on. Proudhon was selected out of several candidates primarily due to the fact that his income was much lower than the others and the judges were extremely impressed by his writing and the level of education he had given himself while working as an artisan. Proudhon arrived in Paris towards the end of autumn in 1838.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp28-30\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/28 28\u201330]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/28}}</ref>\n\n=== Early writings ===\nIn 1839, the Academy of Besan\u00e7on held an essay competition on the subject of the utility of the celebration of Sunday in regard to hygiene, morality and the relationship of the family and the city. Proudhon's entry, titled ''De la C\u00e9l\u00e9bration du dimanche'', essentially used the essay subject as a pretext for discussing a variety of political and philosophical ideas and in it one can find the seeds of his later revolutionary ideas. Many of his ideas on authority, morality and property disturbed the essay judges at the Academy and Proudhon was only awarded the bronze medal (something in which Proudhon took pride because he felt that this was an indicator that his writing made elite academics uncomfortable).<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp39-42\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39 39\u201342]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39}}</ref> In 1840, he published his first work ''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (or ''[[What Is Property]]'').\n\nHis third memoir on property was a letter to the [[Fourierist]] writer [[Consid\u00e9rant]], published in 1842 under the title ''Warning to Proprietors''.<ref>See [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon#Bibliography|bibliography]] below.</ref> Proudhon was tried for it at Besan\u00e7on, but he was acquitted when the jury found that they could not condemn him for a philosophy that they themselves could not understand.<ref name=\"Britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon \"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\"].

He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767\u20131855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Beside Dupont de l'Eure, the provisional government was dominated by [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberals]] such as [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] (Foreign Affairs), [[Alexandre Auguste Ledryeet-Rollin]] (Interior), [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]] (Justice) and [[Auguste Burdeau]] (War) because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. As during the 1830 [[July Revolution]], the Republican-Socialist Party had set up a counter-government in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]], including [[Louis Blanc]], [[Armand Marrast]], [[Ferdinand Flocon]] and [[Alexandre Martin]].\n\nProudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849<!-- which month? -->, ''Solution du probl\u00e8me social'' (''[[Solution of the Social Problem]]''), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\nDuring the [[Second French Republic]] (1848\u20131852), Proudhon had his biggest public effect through journalism. He got involved with four newspapers, namely ''Le Repr\u00e9sentant du Peuple'' (February 1848\u2013August 1848), ''Le Peuple'' (September 1848\u2013June 1849), ''La Voix du Peuple'' (September 1849\u2013May 1850) and ''Le Peuple de 1850'' (June 1850\u2013October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical combative journalism that appealed to many French workers, but alienated others. He repeatedly criticised the government's policies and promoted reformation of credit and exchange. He tried to establish a popular bank (''Banque du peuple'') early in 1849, but despite over 13,000 people signing up (mostly workers) receipts were limited falling short of 18,000FF and the whole enterprise was essentially stillborn.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\nProudhon ran for the [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille. He was successful, in the complementary elections of 4 June 1848 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. However, he was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nIn 1848, the closing of the National Workshops provoked the [[June Days uprising]] and the violence shocked Proudhon. Visiting the barricades personally, he later reflected that his presence at the [[Bastille]] at this time was \"one of the most honorable acts of my life\", but in general during the tumultuous events of 1848 he opposed [[insurrection]] by preaching peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. Proudhon disapproved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May and June 1848, though he was sympathetic to the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionists had been forced to endure.\n\nIn Spain, Ram\u00f3n de la Sagra established the anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in La Coru\u00f1a in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anarchism|title=anarchism &#124; Definition & History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish<ref>[[George Woodcock]].

According to [[George Woodcock]], \"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\".<ref>George Woodcock.

After his release, he remained in exile from 1858 to 1862 in Belgium. Upon the liberalization of the empire in 1863, he returned to France.\n\n=== Death ===\nProudhon died in [[Passy]] on 19 January 1865 and was buried in Paris at the cemetery of [[Montparnasse]].<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=zZYWv4McvfUC&pg=PA60&dq=proudhon+montparnasse+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0xOCR9ZvlAhWSpp4KHaRlBcYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=proudhon%20montparnasse%20cemetery&f=false ''Property is Theft!'']</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n=== Anarchism ===\nProudhon was a social [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anarchy.no/proudhon.html|title=Pierre Joseph Proudhon's basic ideas|work=International Institute for Organization Research}}</ref> According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], Proudhon was the first person to refer to himself as an \"anarchist\".<ref>Rod Bush, ''The End of White World Supremacy: Black Internationalism and the Problem of the Color Line'', [[Temple University Press]], 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=phnJYxEM5FcC&pg=PA226 p. 226], {{ISBN|1592135749}}, 9781592135745</ref><ref>Roger Eatwell, Anthony Wright, ''Contemporary Political Ideologies: Second Edition'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7MQwlPj-kiYC&pg=PA132 p. 132], {{ISBN|082645173X}}, 9780826451736</ref> In ''What Is Property?'', published in 1840, he defined anarchy as \"the absence of a master, of a sovereign\" and wrote: \"As man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy\".<ref>[[Josephus Nelson Larned]], ''The New Larned History for Ready Reference, Reading and Research'', C.A.

In a subchapter called \"What is Government?\", he wrote:\n{{quote|To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place[d] under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.<ref>P.-J. Proudhon, \"What Is Government?\", written in ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', translated by John Beverly Robinson (London: [[Freedom Press]], 1923), pp. 293\u201394.</ref>}}\n\n=== Mutualism ===\n{{see also|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\n{{quote|\"Capital\"&nbsp;... in the political field is analogous to \"government\".&nbsp;... The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority, and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them.&nbsp;... What capital does to labour, and the State to liberty, the Church does to the spirit. This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy. The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body, its will and its reason.<ref>P.-J. Proudhon, ''Les confessions d'un r\u00e9volutionnaire'', (Paris: Garnier, 1851), p. 271., quoted by Max Nettlau, ''A Short History of Anarchism'', pp. 43\u201344.</ref>}}\nIn his earliest works, Proudhon analyzed the nature and problems of the capitalist economy. While deeply critical of [[capitalism]], he also objected to those contemporary socialists who advocated centralized hierarchical forms of association or state control of the economy. In a sequence of commentaries from ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), posthumously published in the ''Th\u00e9orie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (''Theory of Property'', 1863\u20131864), he declared in turn that \"property is theft\", \"property is impossible\", \"property is despotism\" and \"property is freedom\". When he said \"property is theft\", he was referring to the landowner or capitalist who he believed \"stole\" the profits from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was \"subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience\".<ref>[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, \u00a7 3 \u00b6 5].</ref>\n\nIn asserting that property is freedom, he was referring not only to the product of an individual's labor, but to the peasant or artisan's home and tools of his trade and the income he received by selling his goods. For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property is labor. What one produces is one's property and anything beyond that is not. He advocated worker self-management and was opposed to the private ownership of the means of production. As he put it in 1848:\n{{quote|Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.&nbsp;... We are socialists&nbsp;... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership.&nbsp;... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations.&nbsp;... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic.<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>}}\n\nProudhon called himself a [[socialist]], but he opposed state ownership of capital goods in favour of ownership by workers themselves in associations. This makes him one of the first theorists of [[libertarian socialism]]. Proudhon was one of the main influences on the theory of [[workers' self-management]] (''autogestion'') in the late 19th and 20th century.\n\nProudhon strenuously rejected the ownership of the products of labor by society or the state, arguing in ''What Is Property?'' that while \"property in product&nbsp;... does not carry with it property in the means of production.<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 109.</ref>&nbsp;... The right to product is exclusive&nbsp;... the right to means is common\" and applied this to the land (\"the land is&nbsp;... a common thing\")<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 92.</ref> and workplaces (\"all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its exclusive proprietor\").<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 120.</ref> He argued that while society owned the means of production or land, users would control and run them (under supervision from society) with the \"organising of regulating societies\" in order to \"regulate the market\".<ref>Proudhon, ''Selected Writings'', p. 70.</ref>\n\n[[File:Proudhon-Grab.JPG|thumb|Proudhon's grave in Paris]]\nThis use-ownership he called \"possession\" and this economic system [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. Proudhon had many arguments against entitlement to land and capital, including reasons based on morality, economics, politics and individual liberty. One such argument was that it enabled profit, which in turn led to social instability and war by creating cycles of debt that eventually overcame the capacity of labor to pay them off. Another was that it produced \"despotism\" and turned workers into wage workers subject to the authority of a boss.\n\nIn ''What Is Property?'', Proudhon wrote:\n{{quote|Property, acting by exclusion and encroachment, while population was increasing, has been the life-principle and definitive cause of all revolutions. Religious wars, and wars of conquest, when they have stopped short of the extermination of races, have been only accidental disturbances, soon repaired by the mathematical progression of the life of nations. The downfall and death of societies are due to the power of accumulation possessed by property.}}\n\nTowards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In ''The Principle of Federation'' (1863), he modified his earlier anti-state position, arguing for \"the balancing of authority by liberty\" and put forward a decentralised \"theory of federal government\". He also defined anarchy differently as \"the government of each by himself\", which meant \"that political functions have been reduced to industrial functions, and that social order arises from nothing but transactions and exchanges\". This work also saw him call his economic system an \"agro-industrial federation\", arguing that it would provide \"specific federal arrangements&nbsp;... to protect the citizens of the federated states from capitalist and financial feudalism, both within them and from the outside\" and so stop the re-introduction of \"wage labour\". This was because \"political right requires to be buttressed by economic right\".\n\nIn the posthumously published ''Theory of Property'', he argued that \"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State\". Hence, \"Proudhon could retain the idea of property as theft, and at the same time offer a new definition of it as liberty. There is the constant possibility of abuse, exploitation, which spells theft. At the same time property is a spontaneous creation of society and a bulwark against the ever-encroaching power of the State\".<ref>Copleston, Frederick. ''Social Philosophy in France'', A History of Philosophy, Volume IX, Image/Doubleday, 1994, p. 67.</ref>\n\nHe continued to oppose both capitalist and state property. In ''Theory of Property'', he maintains: \"Now in 1840, I categorically rejected the notion of property for both the group and the individual\", but then states his new theory of property that \"property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists, with an unequaled capacity for setting itself against authority\" and the \"principal function of private property within the political system will be to act as a counterweight to the power of the State, and by so doing to insure the liberty of the individual\". However, he continued to oppose concentrations of wealth and property, arguing for small-scale property ownership associated with peasants and artisans. He still opposed private property in land: \"What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on\". In addition, he still believed that \"property\" should be more equally distributed and limited in size to that actually used by individuals, families and workers associations.<ref>Proudhon, ''Theory of Property'' in ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon''  pp. 129, 133, 135\u2013136.</ref> He supported the right of inheritance and defended \"as one of the foundations of the family and society\".<ref>Steward Edwards, Introduction to ''Selected Writings of P.J. Proudhon''.</ref> However, he refused to extend this beyond personal possessions, arguing that \"[u]nder the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour\".<ref>In [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] (ed.), ''No Gods, No Masters'', vol. 1, p. 62.</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and communism. He adopted the term [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers. In his vision, self-employed artisans, peasants and cooperatives would trade their products on the market. For Proudhon, factories and other large workplaces would be run by \"labor associations\" operating on directly democratic principles. The state would be abolished and instead society would be organized by a federation of \"free communes\" (a [[Communes of France|commune]] is a local municipality in French). In 1863, Proudhon said: \"All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization\".<ref>Du principe F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif [Principle of Federation] (1863)</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed the charging of interest and rent, but he did not seek to abolish them by law: \"I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose\".<ref>''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem'', Edited by Henry Cohen. [[Vanguard Press]], 1927.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution ===\nProudhon was a revolutionary. However, his revolution did not mean violent upheaval or civil war, but rather the transformation of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was monetary reform, combined with organising a credit bank and workers associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about the organization of society along new lines{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People}}\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nHe made no public criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] or Marxism because in Proudhon's lifetime Marx was relatively unknown. It was only after Proudhon's death that Marxism became a large movement. However, he did criticize [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian socialists]] of his period. This included the [[state socialist]] [[Louis Blanc]], of whom Proudhon said: \"Let me say to M. Blanc: you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must have a God, a religion, a dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy, distinctions, and ranks. For my part, I deny your God, your authority, your sovereignty, your judicial State, and all your representative mystifications\". It was Proudhon's book ''What Is Property?'' that convinced the young Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.\n\nIn one of his first works, ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'', Marx said: \"Not only does Proudhon write in the interest of the [[proletarian]]s, he is himself a proletarian, an ouvrier. His work is a scientific manifesto of the French proletariat\". However, Marx disagreed with Proudhon's anarchism and later published vicious criticisms of Proudhon. Marx wrote ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' as a refutation of Proudhon's ''The Philosophy of Poverty''.\n\nIn their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: \"I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/letters/46_05_17.htm|title=Proudhon to Karl Marx|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Nationalism, militarism and war ===\nProudhon opposed militarism, dictatorship and war, arguing that the \"end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century, under pain of indefinite decadence\"<ref>quoted by George Woodcock, ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 233</ref> and that the \"workers alone are capable of putting an end to war by creating [[economic equilibrium]]. This presupposes a radical revolution in ideas and morals\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 214</ref> As Robert L. Hoffman notes, ''War and Peace'' \"ends by condemning war without reservation\" and its \"conclusion [is] that war is obsolete\".<ref>''Revolutionary Justice'', pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> Marxist philosopher John Ehrenberg summarized Proudhon's position as such:\n<blockquote>If injustice was the cause of war, it followed that conflict could not be eliminated until society was reorganised along egalitarian lines. Proudhon had wanted to prove that the reign of political economy would be the reign of peace, finding it difficult to believe that people really thought he was defending militarism.<ref>''Proudhon and His Age'', p. 145.</ref></blockquote>\n\nProudhon argued that under mutualism \"[t]here will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right\".<ref>''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. 283.</ref>\n\nProudhon also rejected dictatorship, stating in the 1860s that \"what I will always be&nbsp;... a republican, a democrat even, and a socialist into the bargain\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 201.</ref> Henri de Lubac argued that in terms of Proudhon's critique of democracy \"we must not allow all this to hoodwink us. His invectives against democracy were not those of a counter-revolutionary. They were aimed at what he himself called 'the false democracy'.&nbsp;... They attacked an apparently liberal 'pseudo-democracy' which 'was not economic and social'&nbsp;... 'a Jacobinical democracy'\". Proudhon \"did not want to destroy, but complete, the work of 1789\" and while \"he had a grudge against the 'old democracy', the democracy of Robespierre and Marat\", he repeatedly contrasted it \"with a 'young democracy', which was a 'social democracy'\".<ref>''The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian of anarchism [[George Woodcock]], some positions Proudhon took \"sorted oddly with his avowed anarchism\". Woodcock cited for example Proudhon's proposition that each citizen perform one or two years militia service.<ref>George Woodcock ''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A Biography]]'', Black Rose Books, 1987, p. 128.</ref> The proposal appeared in the ''Programme Revolutionaire'', an electoral manifesto issued by Proudhon after he was asked to run for a position in the provisional government. The text reads: \"7\u00b0 'L'arm\u00e9e. \u2013 Abolition imm\u00e9diate de la conscription et des remplacements; obligation pour tout citoyen de faire, pendant un ou deux ans, le service militaire; application de l'arm\u00e9e aux services administratifs et travaux d'utilit\u00e9 publique\" (\"Military service by all citizens is proposed as an alternative to conscription and the practice of \"replacement\", by which those who could avoided such service\"). In the same document, Proudhon also described the \"form of government\" he was proposing as \"a centralization analogous with that of the State, but in which no one obeys, no one is dependent, and everyone is free and sovereign\".<ref>\"Programme r\u00e9volutionnaire.\" ''M\u00e9langes. Tome I''. Paris: Lacroix, 1868. 72, 70.</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn addition to being considered a founding father of anarchism, some have tried to link him to the extreme right. He was first used as a reference in the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', a right-wing association formed in 1911 by [[Georges Valois]] and [[Edouard Berth]]. Both had been brought together by the [[syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]], but they would tend toward a synthesis of [[socialism]] and [[nationalism]], mixing Proudhon's mutualism with [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralist nationalism]]. In 1925, Georges Valois founded the [[Faisceau]], the first fascist league, which took its name from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s ''[[fasci]]''. Historian of [[History of far-right movements in France|fascism, in particular of French fascists]], [[Zeev Sternhell]], has noted this use of Proudhon by the far-right. In ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology'', he states:\n{{quote|[T]he [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]&nbsp;... from its inception regarded the author of ''La philosophie de la mis\u00e8re'' as one of its masters.<ref>Griffiths, Richard. 2005. Continuum International Publishing Group. pp. 23\u201324.</ref> He was given a place of honour in the weekly section of the journal of the movement entitled, precisely, 'Our Masters.' Proudhon owed this place in L'Action fran\u00e7aise to what the Maurrassians saw as his antirepublicanism, his anti-Semitism, his loathing of Rousseau, his disdain for the French Revolution, democracy, and parliamentarianism: and his championship of the nation, the family, tradition, and the monarchy.}}\n\nHowever, K. Steven Vincent states that \"to argue that Proudhon was a proto-fascist suggests that one has never looked seriously at Proudhon's writings\".<ref>''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[J. Salwyn Schapiro]] argued in 1945 that Proudhon was a racist, \"a glorifier of war for its own sake\" and his \"advocacy of personal dictatorship and his laudation of militarism can hardly be equalled in the reactionary writings of his or of our day\".<ref name=\"Schapiro\">{{cite journal|author=[[J.

Robert Graham states that while Proudhon was personally racist, \"anti-semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme\".<ref>\"Introduction\", ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. xxxvi.</ref>\n\n[[Albert Meltzer]] has said that though Proudhon used the term \"anarchist\", he was not one and that he never engaged in \"anarchist activity or struggle\", but rather in \"parliamentary activity\".<ref>Albert Meltzer. Anarchism: Arguments for and Against, AK Press, 2000, p. 12.</ref>\n\nProudhon also engaged in an exchange of published letters between 1849 and 1850 with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] discussing the legitimacy of interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/FB-PJP-DOI.htm|title=Bastiat-Proudhon Debate on Interest|publisher=Praxeology.net|accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref> As [[Robert Leroux (sociologist)|Robert Leroux]] argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\".<ref>Leroux, Robert. \"Political Economy and Liberalism: The Economic Contribution of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat\", Routledge, 2011, p. 118.</ref> Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat: \"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man\".<ref>Roche, Charles George. \"Frederic Bastiat: A Man Alone\". Arlington House, 1971, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== Antisemitism and sexism ===\nStewart Edwards, the editor of the ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', remarks: \"Proudhon's diaries (Carnets, ed. P. Haubtmann, Marcel Rivi\u00e8re, Paris 1960 to date) reveal that he had almost paranoid feelings of hatred against the Jews. In 1847, he considered publishing an article [[anti-Semitism|against the Jewish race]], which he said he \"hated\". The proposed article would have \"called for the expulsion of the Jews from France\". It would have stated: \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated. [[Heinrich Heine|H. Heine]], A. Weil, and others are simply secret spies; [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]], [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux|Cr\u00e9mieux]], [[Marx]], [[Fould]], evil choleric, envious, bitter men who hate us\". (Carnets, vol. 2, p.&nbsp;337: No VI, 178)\".<ref name=\"marxists\">\"Carnets de P. J. Proudhon. Paris, M. Rivi\u00e8re, 1960\", translated by Mitchell Abido for marxists.org. [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/1847/jews.htm \"On the Jews\"].</ref> Proudhon differentiated his antisemitism from that of the Middle Ages, presenting it as quasi-scientific: \"What the peoples of the Middle Ages hated by instinct, I hate upon reflection and irrevocably\".<ref>Rubenstein, Richard L. and John K. Roth (1987). ''Approaches to Auschwitz: The Legacy of the Holocaust''. London: SCM. p. 71.</ref>\n\nIn an introduction to Proudhon's works, Iain McKay, author of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' (AK Press, 2007), cautions readers by saying that \"[t]his is not to say that Proudhon was without flaws, for he had many\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128135116/http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|archivedate=28 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html|title=An Anarchist FAQ &#124; Anarchist Writers|website=anarchism.pageabode.com}}</ref> and adding the following:\n{{quote|He was not consistently libertarian in his ideas, tactics and language. His personal bigotries are disgusting and few modern anarchists would tolerate them \u2013 Namely, racism and sexism. He made some bad decisions and occasionally ranted in his private notebooks (where the worst of his anti-Semitism was expressed). While he did place his defence of the patriarchal family at the core of his ideas, they are in direct contradiction to his own libertarian and egalitarian ideas. In terms of racism, he sometimes reflected the less-than-enlightened assumptions and prejudices of the nineteenth century. While this does appear in his public work, such outbursts are both rare and asides (usually an extremely infrequent passing anti-Semitic remark or caricature). In short, \"racism was never the basis of Proudhon's political thinking\" (Gemie, 200-1) and \"anti-Semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme.\" (Robert Graham, \"Introduction\", General Idea of the Revolution, xxxvi) To quote Proudhon: \"There will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right.\" (General Idea of the Revolution, 283)<ref>Iain McKay (2011). ''Property Is Theft! A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology''. AK Press UK: Edinburgh. p. 36.</ref>}}\n\nWhile racism was not overtly part of his political philosophy, Proudhon did express [[sexist]] beliefs. He held patriarchal views on women's nature and their proper role in the family and society at large. In his ''Carnets'' (''Notebooks''), unpublished until the 1960s, Proudhon maintained that a woman's choice was to be \"courtesan or housekeeper\". To a woman, a man is \"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\". His justification for [[patriarchy]] is men's greater physical strength and recommended that men use this greater strength to keep women in their place, saying: \"A woman does not at all hate being used with violence, indeed even being violated\". In her study of [[Gustave Courbet]], who painted the portrait of ''Proudhon and his children'' (1865), art historian Linda Nochlin points out that alongside his early articulations of anarchism Proudhon also wrote and published \"the most consistent [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract of its time, or perhaps, any other\", ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'', which \"raises all the main issues about woman's position in society and her sexuality with a paranoid intensity unmatched in any other text\".<ref>Nochlin, ''Courbet''. Thames & Hudson, 2007. p. 220, note 34).</ref>\n\nProudhon's defenses of patriarchy did not go unchallenged in his lifetime and [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] attacked Proudhon's anti-feminism as a contradiction of anarchist principles. D\u00e9jacque directed Proudhon \"either to 'speak out against man's exploitation of woman' or 'do not describe yourself as an anarchist'\".<ref>Jesse Cohn [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2012_chunk_g978140518464962#citation \"Anarchism and gender\"] in: The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest.

I think there is no basis for such dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly rejected both sides of the arguments\u2014on the virtues of vegetarianism or meat eating\u2014as banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served it to his followers and ate himself. History is quite clear that Guru Hargobind and Guru Gobind Singh were accomplished and avid hunters. The game was cooked and put to good use, to throw it away would have been an awful waste''.</ref><ref>''Guru Granth Sahib, An Analytical Study'' by Surindar Singh Kohli, Singh Bros.

I think there is no basis for such dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly rejected both sides of the arguments\u2014on the virtues of vegetarianism or meat eating\u2014as banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served it to his followers and ate himself.

Outliers, however, can appear at any time, and do, accounting for many previously regarded as \"unbeatable\" records being broken \u2013 and in some cases re-broken.\n\n==Pitching==\n[[File:Cy Young 1 MLB HOF.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cy Young]]'s record 511 career wins and 749 complete games have never been approached since he retired in 1911.<ref name=ironman/><ref name=records2/><ref name=cyyoung511/>]]\n\n=== Most career wins \u2013 511 ===\nSet by [[Cy Young]], 1890\u20131911.<ref name=ironman>{{cite web|title=Ripken's iron man record unbreakable|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110907&content_id=24361578&vkey=news_bal&c_id=bal|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2011|first=Terence|last=Moore|website=MLB.com}}</ref><ref name=records2>{{cite web|title=Not all records are made to be broken|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/44681509/ns/sports-baseball/page/2/|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2011|first=Bob|last=Harkins|publisher=NBC Sports.com|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104022848/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/44681509/ns/sports-baseball/page/2/|archive-date=January 4, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=cyyoung511>{{cite web|title=4.

Most pitchers in today's game of five-man rotations start fewer than 35 games per season, and thus do not start enough games to break the record. The most games started by a pitcher in the 2019 season was 34, accomplished by seven pitchers, and only three pitchers in the 21st century have started more than 35 games in a season ([[Tom Glavine]] in 2002 and [[Roy Halladay]] and [[Greg Maddux]] in 2003, each with 36 starts).<ref>{{cite web|title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Games Started|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/GS_top_ten.shtml|accessdate=September 30, 2019 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> Although relief pitchers often [[Games pitched|appear]] in more than the requisite number of games, they rarely record ten wins in a season.  However, the use of relief pitchers increases a starter's chance of a no decision, further limiting the ability to break the record. To put this record in further perspective, the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season was [[Denny McLain]] in 1968 and the last pitcher to win 25 games in a season was [[Bob Welch (baseball)|Bob Welch]] in 1990. Also, the most wins in a season by any pitcher in the 21st century is 24, by [[Randy Johnson]] in 2002 and Justin Verlander in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Wins |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/W_top_ten.shtml |accessdate=September 30, 2019 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref>\n\n=== Most career complete games \u2013 749 ===\nSet by [[Cy Young]], 1890\u20131911.<ref name=records2/> Highlights of this record include: nine 40-[[complete game|complete-game]] seasons, eighteen 30-complete-game seasons<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> and completing 92 percent of his total career starts (an all-time record of 815).<ref name=records2/> The next closest player is [[Pud Galvin]], who has 103 fewer complete games at 646. Among pitchers whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the most is 382 by [[Warren Spahn]].\n\nFor a player to accomplish this, he would have to average 30 complete games over 25 seasons to get to 750. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leaders in complete games averaged eight per season, and only two pitchers in the 21st century have had 10 complete games in any season ([[CC Sabathia]] with 10 in 2008 and [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]] with 11 in 2011).<ref name=Chesbro>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1005/mlb.unbreakable.baseball.records/content.8.html |title=48 complete games \u2013 Jack Chesbro (1904) \u2013 Unbreakable Baseball Records |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> In addition, only two pitchers other than Young have even started as many as 749 games\u2014[[Nolan Ryan]] (773) and [[Don Sutton]] (756).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/GS_career.shtml |title=Career Leaders & Records for Games Started |website=Baseball-Reference |accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref> Among pitchers expected to be active in the 2020 season, Justin Verlander has the most complete games with 26, and only four others have 20 or more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Active Leaders & Records for Complete Games|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/CG_active.shtml|accessdate=September 30, 2019 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref>\n\nThe quest for any complete-game records, either over a career or over a single season, is further complicated by the drastic change in philosophy embraced by virtually all modern managers and pitching coaches, motivated in roughly equal parts by more advanced modern-day medical knowledge of the cumulative damage that pitching does to a hurler's arm, combined with a team front office's reluctance to see a pitcher in whom they have invested considerable financial capital in the form of a big contract getting hurt. Another factor, arguably, is the greater reliance of managers and pitching coaches on [[sabermetrics]]\u2014in this case, statistical data and analysis that generally show leaving a starter in longer leads to diminishing returns in terms of opposing batters allowed to reach base safely and score runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=22378|title=Baseball Prospectus  \u2013 Baseball Therapy: What Happened to the Complete Game?|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>  While even a few decades ago, a starting pitcher was expected to go out and attempt to pitch a complete game, with the manager going to his bullpen only if the starter ran into trouble or was injured or visibly tiring, the present-day norm is the starter is expected to give his manager six, or perhaps seven \"quality innings,\" at which point the manager\u2014who, along with the pitching coach, has been tracking the starter's pitch count\u2014will normally lift him and bring in one or more middle-relief specialists to pitch the next several innings and form a bridge to the team's closer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballmagazine.net/2015/09/04/lost-art-of-the-complete-game/|title=Lost Art of the Complete Game|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> There are exceptions\u2014a manager will leave a starter in who is working on a no-hitter or, sometimes, a shutout, or will let a starter continue if he is pitching particularly strongly and has not run up a high pitch count. But managerial caution is now a more dominant mode, particularly if a pitcher is coming off a recent injury or has had [[Tommy John surgery]] or any other major procedure done on his pitching arm.\n\nThese changes in philosophy have reduced the number of complete games in today's game to an even greater extent than in the first decade of the 21st century. Since Shields amassed 11 complete games in 2011, no pitcher has had more than 6 complete games in a season. In 2018, all of Major League Baseball combined for 42 complete games, with no pitcher having more than 2. The 2019 season was similar in both respects, with 45 total complete games and no pitcher having more than 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/CG_top_ten.shtml |title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Complete Games |website=Baseball-Reference |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref> In a 2019 story, Sam Miller of [[ESPN]] went so far as to say, \"In your lifetime, you might very well see the last complete game.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26295852/how-many-complete-games-thrown-2019-thirty-ten-none |title=How many complete games will be thrown in 2019?

''Sports Illustrated'' has said about this record, \"Even if the bar is lowered to begin with the live-ball era (which began in 1920), the mark would still be untouchable.\" The most complete games recorded in a live-ball season is 33, achieved three times in all\u2014twice at the dawn of that era by [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] in 1920 and [[Burleigh Grimes]] in 1923, and also by [[Dizzy Trout]] in 1944, a season in which the player pool was severely depleted by military call-ups during [[World War II]].

[[George Sisler]]'s .420 average in 1922 still stands as the highest American League average of the modern era. [[Ted Williams]] hit .406 in 1941, the last player in either league to top .400 for a season. Since then, only [[George Brett]], who hit .390 in 1980, and [[Tony Gwynn]], who hit .394 in a strike-shortened season in 1994, have even come close to reaching .400, and they were nowhere near any of the historical league or MLB highs.\n\nIn a 2018 ESPN story, the aforementioned Sam Miller argued that it was impossible to hit .400, or even seriously challenge the mark, in the modern game, noting that no hitter in the 21st century entered the second half of the season with an average above .380, and no batter since 2009 who qualified for his league's batting title had a .400 average at any point after May 25. Additionally, Miller argued that a player who might conceivably challenge .400 would have to combine a low strikeout rate, high home run rate, and high batting average on balls in play\u2014a group of skills which largely do not complement one another.<ref name=\"Miller 400\"/>\n\n=== Most RBI in a season \u2013 191 ===\nSet by [[Hack Wilson]], who batted in 191 runs in 1930. Only [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Hank Greenberg]], at 184 and 183 [[Run batted in|RBI]] respectively, ever came close, and there have been no real challenges to the record for over 75 years.\n\nHowever, Sam Miller argued in 2019 that a serious challenge to Wilson's record, though highly unlikely, was less implausible than challenges to many of the other records listed here. He noted that in 1930, Wilson came to bat with 524 runners on base, drove in 22.7% of them, and hit 56 homers. Neither the number of base-runners nor the RBI percentage is within the top 60 seasons for those statistics in MLB history, with some seasons in the top 60 of both categories having been recorded in the 21st century, and he added \"we've all seen players hit 56 home runs, even this decade.\"<ref name=\"Miller 2019 unbreakable\"/>  However, with today's batters pursuing one of baseball's so-called \"three true outcomes\" \u2013 a home run, walk, or strikeout<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three_True_Outcomes Three True Outcomes, Baseball-reference.com]</ref> \u2013 there is less likelihood of enough runners on base for such a season to produce anything like 191 RBI.\n\n=== Highest career on-base percentage \u2013 .482 ===\n[[File:Ted Williams BBall Digest May 1949 raw.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ted Williams]] topped a .400 on-base percentage 18 times in his 19 years, often by 100 points or more, including .553 en route to a .406 batting average in 1941, the last season ever over .400.]]\n\nSet by [[Ted Williams]] from 1939 to 1960.<ref name=Williams>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1005/mlb.unbreakable.baseball.records/content.9.html |title=.482 lifetime on-base percentage \u2013 Ted Williams \u2013 Unbreakable Baseball Records |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Williams, the last man to hit .400 in an MLB season (.406 in 1941), won six American League batting titles, two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]], and two MVP awards.

Thanks to a best-of-three playoff between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]], which ended the season tied for first place (back when league pennants were winner-take-all, with no annual end-of-season multi-tiered layers of playoffs, play-ins, and wild cards), both teams played 165 games.\n\nBecause the play-off was to determine the regular season winner of the league championship, the games were counted as extensions of the regular season, and not the post-season, which at that time was composed solely of the [[World Series]].\n\nBoth the individual and team single-season games played records were set at the beginning of a seven year span that began with the 1962 National League expansion to 162 games and ended after the 1968 season, when the NL replaced its traditional best-of-three tiebreakers with [[one-game playoff]]s. The 1962 season was the only occasion during those years in which a tie-breaker was needed. The American League has always used one-game playoffs.\n\nNo team has played more than 163 regular season games in a season since 1962. While there have been a few occasions where a three-way tie was possible going into the last day of the season (which would result in a team playing 164 games), a three-way tie involving postseason berths has never occurred. From 1969 to 1993, it would have been impossible for any team to be involved in more than three one-game playoffs in a season, since only division champions qualified for the postseason and since there was never more than eight teams per division. As of the end of the 2018 season, there has yet to be an occasion in MLB history where five teams of one league have finished with identical records, which would have been the circumstance needed during this era for any team to play even three tie-breakers and thus match the 1962 record.\n\nSince the introduction of the wild card, it has been technically possible to play 166 regular season games, but is extremely unlikely. For a team to have an opportunity to play four tiebreaker games, it would have to be involved in a tie involving three or more teams for the division crown ''and'' a separate tie also involving three or more teams for the second wild card berth, meaning that the aforementioned-unprecedented circumstance at least five teams in two different divisions of the same league finishing with identical records would have to occur. A team in such a situation would then have to win the division \"semi-final\" tiebreaker, lose the division \"final\" and then win the wild card \"semi-final\" in order to play 166 regular season games. The 2018 season, which resulted in two two-way ties for division titles, was the first occasion where there were even multiple two-way ties for division titles \u2013 the losers of the 2018 tiebreaker games (who did not themselves have identical records) subsequently played each other in the Wild Card Game, but that game is considered part of the postseason and not the regular season.\n\nWills' individual record is statistically ever more unlikely to be broken because teams are increasingly inclined to rest even their best players, part of a new ''metric''-based strategy known as \"load management\". On average only about three players in all of baseball appear in all 162 games of any given MLB season. This implies that even if a club somehow managed to play 166 regular season games, there is mathematically only about a ten percent chance a particular team will have a player who will have appeared in all 162 games pending tie-breakers.\n\nIt is also possible for a player to accumulate more than 162 games played in a season by virtue of a mid-season trade.  A swap between a team that has played more games and one which has played fewer can result in a schedule for the traded player to be greater than either individual teams'.

With a total of 326 hits in 1,176 at-bats in his 17-year career, almost all of which occurred while he played in the AL, Ferrell hit .280 and had 208 RBIs,<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ferrewe01</ref> and is considered one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers. Other American League pitchers with notable home-run totals include [[Bob Lemon]], who hit 35 HR as a pitcher and two more as a pinch hitter during his 18-year career, all spent with the Indians; [[Red Ruffing]], who smacked 34 home runs as a pitcher and two more as pinch-hitter over 22 seasons with the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox; and [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], who hit out 35 home runs in an 11-year career \u2013 33 as a pitcher and two as a pinch-hitter \u2013 all but one of them while with the Red Sox and Tigers, and the last as a Padre.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=wilsoea01</ref> With \"good-hitting pitchers\" the exception rather than the rule, the American League's adoption of the [[designated hitter]] rule in 1973 \u2013 leading to the widespread substitution of the DH in the pitcher's traditional #9 slot in the batting order in all AL games and all interleague, All-Star and World Series games played in AL parks \u2013 means that no American League pitcher will ever get enough at-bats to seriously challenge any of the above home run statistics, or any other game, seasonal or career hitting marks set by AL pitchers historically. However, the [[Los Angeles Angels]]' signing of Japanese player [[Shohei Ohtani]] \u2014 who notably plays as both a starting pitcher and a designated hitter \u2014 could mean that Ferrell's record could be broken (although Ohtani generally does not hit and pitch in the same game when playing in AL parks, so his home runs as a DH may not be considered as being hit \"by a pitcher\").\n\n=== Most career sacrifice bunts \u2013 512 ===\nSet by [[Eddie Collins]], who successfully laid down 512 sacrifice bunts over his 25-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics. [[Joe Pasternak]] dubbed Collins as \"the smartest player in baseball history\". Not only was Collins a prolific bunter, but also 10th all-time in [[Wins Above Replacement|WAR]] and hit .333 for his career with 3,315 hits and 745 stolen bases.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisachit1.shtml</ref> Second behind him is [[Jake Daubert]] with 392, more than 100 fewer than Collins. Since the turn of the 20th century, sacrifice bunts have continually fallen further out of favor: ''[[Moneyball]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]], the famous sabermetrician's guide, went as far as to label the bunt as \"evil\". Modern baseball teams value minimizing outs rather than moving a base-runner over a single base position.

They were so bad \u2013 20 wins below the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] \u2013 they likely set an unbreakable record for fewest wins in a season at the same time.\n\nWhat is unusual, however, about their road loss record compared to others on this list in that while most others are theoretically possible (but impractical) to break, it cannot mathematically be broken even if a team achieved a completely [[winless season]] on the road: in today's sport, the 162-game season is equally divided between 81 home and road games, 21 fewer than needed to set a new mark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tourtellotte|first=Shane|title=The unbreakable records|date=September 18, 2013|work=The Hardball Times|url=https://tht.fangraphs.com/the-unbreakable-records/|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[rainout (sports)|rainouts]] and other cancellations can reduce the number of games a team plays in a season, there is no way to accumulate the 21 extra road games needed to break the record. The only situation in which regular season games are ever added to the schedule is in the case of the [[one-game playoff]]; the odds of a team losing all of its road games but still having a record strong enough to qualify for such a game are infinitesimally small. In the uncommon circumstance that a game must be moved to the opposing venue, MLB policy now maintains the [[legal fiction]] that the designated home team does not change, regardless of venue, which ensures the designated home team does not lose [[home advantage|rules advantages]]. This was not the case in 1899, when 35 of the Spiders' home games were changed to road games.\n\nThree other factors contribute to the unique nature of the Spiders' record:\n* In 1899, owners were allowed to own more than one team, and in the case of the Spiders, the owners also owned the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Perfectos]]. Believing it more profitable to have a good team in St. Louis, the Spiders' best players from 1898 \u2013 including future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitchers [[Cy Young]], [[Jesse Burkett]] and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]] \u2013 were given to the Perfectos in exchange for their least desirable players, with their manager, [[Patsy Tebeau]]. From 1900, MLB rules have prohibited a single owner owning more than one team to avoid any repeat of this, or any similar, arrangements.\n* Baseball teams in 1899 had gate receipts as their main source for revenue. Since fans in Cleveland were not going to pay to watch a decimated roster, the Spiders/Perfectos ownership transferred all of the Spiders' home games against the Perfectos to St. Louis. As the season wore on and the crowds in Cleveland shrunk in response to mounting losses, the other 11 NL teams requested the Spiders transfer home games to their parks, as their cut of the gate receipts would leave them unable to recoup the expenses of the journey. Since the Spiders' cut of the gate receipts for road games was far more lucrative than their gate receipts for home games, the Spiders' owners were not inclined to object to such requests. Thus, the Spiders only played eight home games after July 1, giving them the opportunity for 101 road losses (against 11 wins). \n** Today, MLB revenue streams are far more numerous, while in the case of media rights are often both contractually dependent on teams playing their entire schedule, and are not affected by attendance, while travel expenses make up a much smaller portion of a team's budget. MLB rules also state any team that refuses to travel to their opponent's stadium for a scheduled game would immediately [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] the game.\n* The 1899 Spiders played their entire 154-game schedule \u2013 an unusual occurrence in an era when cancellations were much more frequent, and cancelled games were often not made up.\n\nThe 1899 Spiders also hold the records for the most losses in a single MLB season (with 134) and lowest winning percentage (.130). While these are technically possible to break, even under a 162-game schedule, only two teams have come within 15 losses of the record, these being the expansion 1962 New York Mets (40\u2013120, .250 winning percentage) and the [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|2003 Detroit Tigers]] (43\u2013119, .265 winning percentage).\n\nSince 1899, only five teams have recorded a winning percentage under .260 (i.e. less than double that of the 1899 Spiders), and the 1962 Mets are the only team to do so under a 162-game schedule. Excluding the possibility of cancelled games not being made up, a team would need to lose 141 games over a 162-game season to record a .130 winning percentage (this yields a .129 winning percentage if the traditional rounding to three decimal places is ignored).\n\n=== Lowest paying attendance \u2013 6 ===\nThis was set by the [[Worcester Worcesters|Worcester baseball club]] in 1882.<ref name=worcester>Eduardo A.

Most pitchers in today's game of five-man rotations start fewer than 35 games per season, and thus do not start enough games to break the record. The most games started by a pitcher in the 2019 season was 34, accomplished by seven pitchers, and only three pitchers in the 21st century have started more than 35 games in a season ([[Tom Glavine]] in 2002 and [[Roy Halladay]] and [[Greg Maddux]] in 2003, each with 36 starts).<ref>{{cite web|title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Games Started|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/GS_top_ten.shtml|accessdate=September 30, 2019 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> Although relief pitchers often [[Games pitched|appear]] in more than the requisite number of games, they rarely record ten wins in a season.

Another factor, arguably, is the greater reliance of managers and pitching coaches on [[sabermetrics]]\u2014in this case, statistical data and analysis that generally show leaving a starter in longer leads to diminishing returns in terms of opposing batters allowed to reach base safely and score runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=22378|title=Baseball Prospectus  \u2013 Baseball Therapy: What Happened to the Complete Game?|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>  While even a few decades ago, a starting pitcher was expected to go out and attempt to pitch a complete game, with the manager going to his bullpen only if the starter ran into trouble or was injured or visibly tiring, the present-day norm is the starter is expected to give his manager six, or perhaps seven \"quality innings,\" at which point the manager\u2014who, along with the pitching coach, has been tracking the starter's pitch count\u2014will normally lift him and bring in one or more middle-relief specialists to pitch the next several innings and form a bridge to the team's closer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballmagazine.net/2015/09/04/lost-art-of-the-complete-game/|title=Lost Art of the Complete Game|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> There are exceptions\u2014a manager will leave a starter in who is working on a no-hitter or, sometimes, a shutout, or will let a starter continue if he is pitching particularly strongly and has not run up a high pitch count. But managerial caution is now a more dominant mode, particularly if a pitcher is coming off a recent injury or has had [[Tommy John surgery]] or any other major procedure done on his pitching arm.\n\nThese changes in philosophy have reduced the number of complete games in today's game to an even greater extent than in the first decade of the 21st century. Since Shields amassed 11 complete games in 2011, no pitcher has had more than 6 complete games in a season. In 2018, all of Major League Baseball combined for 42 complete games, with no pitcher having more than 2. The 2019 season was similar in both respects, with 45 total complete games and no pitcher having more than 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/CG_top_ten.shtml |title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Complete Games |website=Baseball-Reference |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref> In a 2019 story, Sam Miller of [[ESPN]] went so far as to say, \"In your lifetime, you might very well see the last complete game.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26295852/how-many-complete-games-thrown-2019-thirty-ten-none |title=How many complete games will be thrown in 2019?

Nap Lajoie's .426 in 1901 is the highest in American League history. In the modern (post-\"dead-ball\") era, [[Rogers Hornsby]] hit .424 in 1924, a feat unmatched since then. [[George Sisler]]'s .420 average in 1922 still stands as the highest American League average of the modern era. [[Ted Williams]] hit .406 in 1941, the last player in either league to top .400 for a season. Since then, only [[George Brett]], who hit .390 in 1980, and [[Tony Gwynn]], who hit .394 in a strike-shortened season in 1994, have even come close to reaching .400, and they were nowhere near any of the historical league or MLB highs.\n\nIn a 2018 ESPN story, the aforementioned Sam Miller argued that it was impossible to hit .400, or even seriously challenge the mark, in the modern game, noting that no hitter in the 21st century entered the second half of the season with an average above .380, and no batter since 2009 who qualified for his league's batting title had a .400 average at any point after May 25. Additionally, Miller argued that a player who might conceivably challenge .400 would have to combine a low strikeout rate, high home run rate, and high batting average on balls in play\u2014a group of skills which largely do not complement one another.<ref name=\"Miller 400\"/>\n\n=== Most RBI in a season \u2013 191 ===\nSet by [[Hack Wilson]], who batted in 191 runs in 1930. Only [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Hank Greenberg]], at 184 and 183 [[Run batted in|RBI]] respectively, ever came close, and there have been no real challenges to the record for over 75 years.\n\nHowever, Sam Miller argued in 2019 that a serious challenge to Wilson's record, though highly unlikely, was less implausible than challenges to many of the other records listed here. He noted that in 1930, Wilson came to bat with 524 runners on base, drove in 22.7% of them, and hit 56 homers. Neither the number of base-runners nor the RBI percentage is within the top 60 seasons for those statistics in MLB history, with some seasons in the top 60 of both categories having been recorded in the 21st century, and he added \"we've all seen players hit 56 home runs, even this decade.\"<ref name=\"Miller 2019 unbreakable\"/>  However, with today's batters pursuing one of baseball's so-called \"three true outcomes\" \u2013 a home run, walk, or strikeout<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three_True_Outcomes Three True Outcomes, Baseball-reference.com]</ref> \u2013 there is less likelihood of enough runners on base for such a season to produce anything like 191 RBI.\n\n=== Highest career on-base percentage \u2013 .482 ===\n[[File:Ted Williams BBall Digest May 1949 raw.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ted Williams]] topped a .400 on-base percentage 18 times in his 19 years, often by 100 points or more, including .553 en route to a .406 batting average in 1941, the last season ever over .400.]]\n\nSet by [[Ted Williams]] from 1939 to 1960.<ref name=Williams>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1005/mlb.unbreakable.baseball.records/content.9.html |title=.482 lifetime on-base percentage \u2013 Ted Williams \u2013 Unbreakable Baseball Records |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Williams, the last man to hit .400 in an MLB season (.406 in 1941), won six American League batting titles, two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]], and two MVP awards.

Thanks to a best-of-three playoff between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]], which ended the season tied for first place (back when league pennants were winner-take-all, with no annual end-of-season multi-tiered layers of playoffs, play-ins, and wild cards), both teams played 165 games.\n\nBecause the play-off was to determine the regular season winner of the league championship, the games were counted as extensions of the regular season, and not the post-season, which at that time was composed solely of the [[World Series]].\n\nBoth the individual and team single-season games played records were set at the beginning of a seven year span that began with the 1962 National League expansion to 162 games and ended after the 1968 season, when the NL replaced its traditional best-of-three tiebreakers with [[one-game playoff]]s. The 1962 season was the only occasion during those years in which a tie-breaker was needed. The American League has always used one-game playoffs.\n\nNo team has played more than 163 regular season games in a season since 1962. While there have been a few occasions where a three-way tie was possible going into the last day of the season (which would result in a team playing 164 games), a three-way tie involving postseason berths has never occurred. From 1969 to 1993, it would have been impossible for any team to be involved in more than three one-game playoffs in a season, since only division champions qualified for the postseason and since there was never more than eight teams per division. As of the end of the 2018 season, there has yet to be an occasion in MLB history where five teams of one league have finished with identical records, which would have been the circumstance needed during this era for any team to play even three tie-breakers and thus match the 1962 record.\n\nSince the introduction of the wild card, it has been technically possible to play 166 regular season games, but is extremely unlikely. For a team to have an opportunity to play four tiebreaker games, it would have to be involved in a tie involving three or more teams for the division crown ''and'' a separate tie also involving three or more teams for the second wild card berth, meaning that the aforementioned-unprecedented circumstance at least five teams in two different divisions of the same league finishing with identical records would have to occur. A team in such a situation would then have to win the division \"semi-final\" tiebreaker, lose the division \"final\" and then win the wild card \"semi-final\" in order to play 166 regular season games. The 2018 season, which resulted in two two-way ties for division titles, was the first occasion where there were even multiple two-way ties for division titles \u2013 the losers of the 2018 tiebreaker games (who did not themselves have identical records) subsequently played each other in the Wild Card Game, but that game is considered part of the postseason and not the regular season.\n\nWills' individual record is statistically ever more unlikely to be broken because teams are increasingly inclined to rest even their best players, part of a new ''metric''-based strategy known as \"load management\". On average only about three players in all of baseball appear in all 162 games of any given MLB season. This implies that even if a club somehow managed to play 166 regular season games, there is mathematically only about a ten percent chance a particular team will have a player who will have appeared in all 162 games pending tie-breakers.\n\nIt is also possible for a player to accumulate more than 162 games played in a season by virtue of a mid-season trade.  A swap between a team that has played more games and one which has played fewer can result in a schedule for the traded player to be greater than either individual teams'.

With a total of 326 hits in 1,176 at-bats in his 17-year career, almost all of which occurred while he played in the AL, Ferrell hit .280 and had 208 RBIs,<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ferrewe01</ref> and is considered one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers. Other American League pitchers with notable home-run totals include [[Bob Lemon]], who hit 35 HR as a pitcher and two more as a pinch hitter during his 18-year career, all spent with the Indians; [[Red Ruffing]], who smacked 34 home runs as a pitcher and two more as pinch-hitter over 22 seasons with the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox; and [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], who hit out 35 home runs in an 11-year career \u2013 33 as a pitcher and two as a pinch-hitter \u2013 all but one of them while with the Red Sox and Tigers, and the last as a Padre.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=wilsoea01</ref> With \"good-hitting pitchers\" the exception rather than the rule, the American League's adoption of the [[designated hitter]] rule in 1973 \u2013 leading to the widespread substitution of the DH in the pitcher's traditional #9 slot in the batting order in all AL games and all interleague, All-Star and World Series games played in AL parks \u2013 means that no American League pitcher will ever get enough at-bats to seriously challenge any of the above home run statistics, or any other game, seasonal or career hitting marks set by AL pitchers historically. However, the [[Los Angeles Angels]]' signing of Japanese player [[Shohei Ohtani]] \u2014 who notably plays as both a starting pitcher and a designated hitter \u2014 could mean that Ferrell's record could be broken (although Ohtani generally does not hit and pitch in the same game when playing in AL parks, so his home runs as a DH may not be considered as being hit \"by a pitcher\").\n\n=== Most career sacrifice bunts \u2013 512 ===\nSet by [[Eddie Collins]], who successfully laid down 512 sacrifice bunts over his 25-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics. [[Joe Pasternak]] dubbed Collins as \"the smartest player in baseball history\". Not only was Collins a prolific bunter, but also 10th all-time in [[Wins Above Replacement|WAR]] and hit .333 for his career with 3,315 hits and 745 stolen bases.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisachit1.shtml</ref> Second behind him is [[Jake Daubert]] with 392, more than 100 fewer than Collins. Since the turn of the 20th century, sacrifice bunts have continually fallen further out of favor: ''[[Moneyball]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]], the famous sabermetrician's guide, went as far as to label the bunt as \"evil\". Modern baseball teams value minimizing outs rather than moving a base-runner over a single base position. At the end of the 2019 season, the active leader in career sacrifice bunts, [[Clayton Kershaw]], had 108\u2014which placed him in a tie for 334th on the all-time list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SH_career.shtml |title=Career Leaders & Records for Sacrifice Hits |work=Baseball-Reference |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Most stolen bases in a season \u2013 130 ===\n[[File:Baseball steal.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rickey Henderson]] holds both the single season (130) and career stolen base records (1,406), both regarded as unlikely to be broken.]]\nSet by Henderson with 130 in 1982, Henderson was caught stealing 42 times.

They were so bad \u2013 20 wins below the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] \u2013 they likely set an unbreakable record for fewest wins in a season at the same time.\n\nWhat is unusual, however, about their road loss record compared to others on this list in that while most others are theoretically possible (but impractical) to break, it cannot mathematically be broken even if a team achieved a completely [[winless season]] on the road: in today's sport, the 162-game season is equally divided between 81 home and road games, 21 fewer than needed to set a new mark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tourtellotte|first=Shane|title=The unbreakable records|date=September 18, 2013|work=The Hardball Times|url=https://tht.fangraphs.com/the-unbreakable-records/|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[rainout (sports)|rainouts]] and other cancellations can reduce the number of games a team plays in a season, there is no way to accumulate the 21 extra road games needed to break the record. The only situation in which regular season games are ever added to the schedule is in the case of the [[one-game playoff]]; the odds of a team losing all of its road games but still having a record strong enough to qualify for such a game are infinitesimally small. In the uncommon circumstance that a game must be moved to the opposing venue, MLB policy now maintains the [[legal fiction]] that the designated home team does not change, regardless of venue, which ensures the designated home team does not lose [[home advantage|rules advantages]]. This was not the case in 1899, when 35 of the Spiders' home games were changed to road games.\n\nThree other factors contribute to the unique nature of the Spiders' record:\n* In 1899, owners were allowed to own more than one team, and in the case of the Spiders, the owners also owned the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Perfectos]]. Believing it more profitable to have a good team in St. Louis, the Spiders' best players from 1898 \u2013 including future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitchers [[Cy Young]], [[Jesse Burkett]] and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]] \u2013 were given to the Perfectos in exchange for their least desirable players, with their manager, [[Patsy Tebeau]]. From 1900, MLB rules have prohibited a single owner owning more than one team to avoid any repeat of this, or any similar, arrangements.\n* Baseball teams in 1899 had gate receipts as their main source for revenue. Since fans in Cleveland were not going to pay to watch a decimated roster, the Spiders/Perfectos ownership transferred all of the Spiders' home games against the Perfectos to St. Louis. As the season wore on and the crowds in Cleveland shrunk in response to mounting losses, the other 11 NL teams requested the Spiders transfer home games to their parks, as their cut of the gate receipts would leave them unable to recoup the expenses of the journey. Since the Spiders' cut of the gate receipts for road games was far more lucrative than their gate receipts for home games, the Spiders' owners were not inclined to object to such requests. Thus, the Spiders only played eight home games after July 1, giving them the opportunity for 101 road losses (against 11 wins). \n** Today, MLB revenue streams are far more numerous, while in the case of media rights are often both contractually dependent on teams playing their entire schedule, and are not affected by attendance, while travel expenses make up a much smaller portion of a team's budget. MLB rules also state any team that refuses to travel to their opponent's stadium for a scheduled game would immediately [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] the game.\n* The 1899 Spiders played their entire 154-game schedule \u2013 an unusual occurrence in an era when cancellations were much more frequent, and cancelled games were often not made up.\n\nThe 1899 Spiders also hold the records for the most losses in a single MLB season (with 134) and lowest winning percentage (.130). While these are technically possible to break, even under a 162-game schedule, only two teams have come within 15 losses of the record, these being the expansion 1962 New York Mets (40\u2013120, .250 winning percentage) and the [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|2003 Detroit Tigers]] (43\u2013119, .265 winning percentage).\n\nSince 1899, only five teams have recorded a winning percentage under .260 (i.e. less than double that of the 1899 Spiders), and the 1962 Mets are the only team to do so under a 162-game schedule. Excluding the possibility of cancelled games not being made up, a team would need to lose 141 games over a 162-game season to record a .130 winning percentage (this yields a .129 winning percentage if the traditional rounding to three decimal places is ignored).\n\n=== Lowest paying attendance \u2013 6 ===\nThis was set by the [[Worcester Worcesters|Worcester baseball club]] in 1882.<ref name=worcester>Eduardo A.
