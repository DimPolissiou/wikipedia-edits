The flood marker was installed after the 2010 event with funding provided as part of a Community Development and Recovery Package, which was a joint initiative between the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] and the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]].\n\n===River Crossings===\nProviding an adequate river crossing enabling travellers on the Leichhardt Highway to cross the river at Taroom has proved challenging due to the flooding the Dawson River experiences.  In total, four bridges have been constructed across the Dawson River.  The first bridge was built in 1863.  The second bridge was opened in 1863 and the headstock and some of the original piles are still visible today.  A third bridge was constructed across the Dawson River in 1956 and still exists today.  Although it is now closed to vehicular traffic, it remains open for pedestrians and cyclists.  This bridge is also a popular spot for local fisherman to sit and cast a line into the river.\n\nTaroom's fourth bridge is the William Harold Copeland bridge which was opened in 1990 and named after the mayor of the [[Shire of Taroom|Taroom Shire]].

This colonial government funded force consisted of white officers in charge of Aboriginal troopers from areas distant to their region of deployment. The method employed by the Native Police to crush resistance to British occupation was known as \"dispersal\", which involved indiscriminate shooting and killing of Indigenous men, women and children that were found in the associated frontier area.{{fact|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter the Hornet Bank massacre, the first Native Police division to arrive on the scene was that of Lieutenant [[Walter David Taylor Powell|Walter Powell]]. He took his troopers in a westerly direction and found a group of Aboriginals of which he shot dead five. Powell enrolled the surviving Fraser brothers, William and Sylvester, as special constables for his second punitive mission and they shot dead a further nine people. 2nd-Lieutenants Moorhead and Carr of the Native Police arrived soon after with their troopers, killing around another thirteen Aboriginals. By December 1857 Powell had increased the number of troopers in his division to seventeen, which he put to use by conducting raids on peaceful \"station blacks\" at [[Taroom]], killing five including three native women as they tried to flee. Powell with William Fraser and 2nd-Lieutenant R.G.Walker led another raid at [[Wandoan|Juandah]] shooting dead another eleven Aboriginals. By April 1858, other divisions of Native Police led by [[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset]], [[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]], [[John O'Connell Bligh]], [[George Poultney Malcolm Murray|George Murray]] and Charles Phibbs had become active in the area, conducting raids of indiscriminate summary justice. Henry Gregory and his brother, the explorer [[A.C. Gregory]] were also involved in the punitive expeditions as they were squatters in the area.  In his memoirs, local pastoralist George Serocold wrote that a dozen local black men who were considered leaders in the region at that time were rounded up and then ordered to run through an open field. As they fled they were shot dead by those who had ordered them to run.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Gordon|title=A Nest of Hornets|date=1982|pages=67\u201385}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Browns\"===\nGeorge Serocold was also involved in the formation of a mounted vigilante death squad in response to the Hornet Bank massacre. The squad was called \"The Browns\" and consisted of Serocold, his property manager at Cockatoo station, Murray-Prior, Horton, Alfred Thomas, McArthur, Piggott, Ernest Davies and three Aboriginal servants including Billy Hayes and Freddy. This group formed at Hawkwood station on the nearby Auburn River. They conducted shooting raids upon mostly innocent \"station blacks\" in this area during their six-week mission, including the perpetration of a massacre at Redbank station. Native Police also went through Redbank station three weeks afterwards, conducting another massacre on this property.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Gordon|title=A Nest of Hornets|date=1982|pages=87\u201391}}</ref>\n\n===Frederick Walker's private militia===\nDespite, or perhaps, because of the sustained and severe punishment meted out by the government's Native Police,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3725288 |title=BORDER WAR. |newspaper=[[The Moreton Bay Courier]] |volume=XII |issue=657 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=9 June 1858 |accessdate=2 December 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Aboriginal resistance in the immediate region continued with the killing of six station-hands in April 1858.

He continued killing randomly wherever he found Aborigines. He shot an Aboriginal jockey at the racetrack in [[Taroom, Queensland|Taroom]] and after two Aboriginals accused of being involved in the massacre were found not guilty he shot both dead as they left the [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] courthouse. It was reported that after Fraser shot an Aboriginal woman in the main street of [[Toowoomba]] because he claimed she was wearing his mother's dress, two policemen spoke with him briefly before saluting and walking away. This incident reinforced a local belief that the Government had given him twelve months' immunity from prosecution, during which he was free to avenge the massacre of his family.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1905, Fraser was asked if he had an authority, he replied \"I never asked and never received such an authority but felt I was justified in doing so (the killings).\"<ref name=\"stewart\">{{cite news | last = Stewart | first = James | date = 15 April 1905 | title = The Hornet Bank Tragedy | work = [[The Queenslander]] | location = [[Brisbane]], Australia | page = 8 }}</ref>\n\nOn the banks of the Juandah lagoon, near [[Wandoan]], there is a place called Fraser's Revenge where according to the local settlers, a group of Aboriginals massacred by a posse led by Fraser are buried.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141768262 |title=JUANDAH TO HORNET BANK |newspaper=[[The Australasian]] |volume=CXL |issue=4,541 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=18 January 1936 |accessdate=2 December 2017 |page=4 (METROPOLITAN EDITION) |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> Also at Wandoan, there was another incident reported by Frederick Walker to Attorney-General in Brisbane that involved the massacring of Aboriginals at the magistrate's residence in that town.

Some managed to flee to [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] (300&nbsp;km east of Taroom), but even there they were unsafe. The police continued harassing them for a number of years after. Fraser's revenge campaign eventually resulted in the believed extermination of the Iman tribe and language. This is most certainly not true due to the Iman men,women & children escaping and hiding further than any police officer could imagine. By March 1858 up to 300 Iman had been killed. Although the Iman people survived not many actually live in the tribes borders, you will most commonly find Iman men, women & children throughout the surrounding areas such as Rockhampton, Mount Morgan, Gladstone, Blackwater and many more towns near and far. Public and police sympathy for Fraser was so high that he was never arrested for any of the killings and gained a reputation as a folk hero throughout Queensland.<ref name=\"Elder\"/>\n\nSylvester Fraser never recovered either physically or mentally.

This colonial government funded force consisted of white officers in charge of Aboriginal troopers from areas distant to their region of deployment. The method employed by the Native Police to crush resistance to British occupation was known as \"dispersal\", which involved indiscriminate shooting and killing of Indigenous men, women and children that were found in the associated frontier area.{{fact|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter the Hornet Bank massacre, the first Native Police division to arrive on the scene was that of Lieutenant [[Walter David Taylor Powell|Walter Powell]]. He took his troopers in a westerly direction and found a group of Aboriginals of which he shot dead five. Powell enrolled the surviving Fraser brothers, William and Sylvester, as special constables for his second punitive mission and they shot dead a further nine people. 2nd-Lieutenants Moorhead and Carr of the Native Police arrived soon after with their troopers, killing around another thirteen Aboriginals. By December 1857 Powell had increased the number of troopers in his division to seventeen, which he put to use by conducting raids on peaceful \"station blacks\" at [[Taroom]], killing five including three native women as they tried to flee. Powell with William Fraser and 2nd-Lieutenant R.G.Walker led another raid at [[Wandoan|Juandah]] shooting dead another eleven Aboriginals. By April 1858, other divisions of Native Police led by [[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset]], [[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]], [[John O'Connell Bligh]], [[George Poultney Malcolm Murray|George Murray]] and Charles Phibbs had become active in the area, conducting raids of indiscriminate summary justice. Henry Gregory and his brother, the explorer [[A.C. Gregory]] were also involved in the punitive expeditions as they were squatters in the area.  In his memoirs, local pastoralist George Serocold wrote that a dozen local black men who were considered leaders in the region at that time were rounded up and then ordered to run through an open field.

This group formed at Hawkwood station on the nearby Auburn River. They conducted shooting raids upon mostly innocent \"station blacks\" in this area during their six-week mission, including the perpetration of a massacre at Redbank station.

By 1840 the Border Police became the main replacement for the NSW Mounted Police along the frontier, while the Native Police Corps, as the Aboriginal force was known, was limited initially to one division in the [[Port Phillip District]] of the colony, around [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]]. Requests for the establishment of a '''Native Police Corps''' were made from as early as 1837 when Captain [[William Lonsdale (colonist)|William Lonsdale]] proposed legislation for its formation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposal for the regulations for the formation of an Aboriginal Police Corps|url=http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/nsw/other_features/correspondence/documents/document_54/|accessdate=29 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729183458/http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/nsw/other_features/correspondence/documents/document_54/|archive-date=29 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment===\nIn October 1837, Christian Ludolph Johannes de Villiers was appointed to command the first official Native Police troopers from their station at Nerre Nerre Warren. It was disbanded briefly in January 1838 but reorganised in April of the same year with their new headquarters in Jolimont where the MCG carpark is now situated.  Due to funding problems, the force was again dissolved in 1839. These issues delayed reformation of the corps until Superintendent [[Charles La Trobe]] indicated he was willing to underwrite the costs in 1842.<ref name=\"ellender\" /> A significant factor in the restoration of the force was the successful capture of five Tasmanian aboriginal people near [[Westernport, Victoria|Westernport]] in 1840 by local Aboriginal men who were attached to a party of [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]] and soldiers.\n\n[[File:Victorian Native Police.jpg|thumb|left|Native Police of Port Phillip, 1850]]\n[[Henry EP Dana]] was selected to command the corps in 1842. Except for a brief period where the corps was based at [[Merri Creek]],<ref name=\"ellender\" /> the headquarters was at the Aboriginal Protectorate Station at Nerre Nerre Warren, near to present day [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] about {{convert|25|km}} south-east of Melbourne.

Once in these areas, the troopers and their officers were placed under the command of the local Commissioner for Crown Lands, who would then seek out and capture or destroy the dissident groups and individuals. In addition to Native Police, the Commissioner also had the troopers of the Border Police and NSW Mounted Police as well as armed volunteer settlers at his disposal to conduct punitive raids on Aboriginal people.<ref name=\"unimelb1986\">{{cite journal|last1=Fels|first1=M.

Divisions of the Native Police would be deployed to these areas in the winter of each year until 1852 and spend the rest of the year mostly garrisoned at the Narre Narre Warren barracks.

They worked under their own officers such as Cowan, Walsh and Dana while also under the authority of Commissioners like Smythe, Bingham, Powlett and McDonald. In 1843 and 1844, Commissioner Smythe led large punitive missions with forces including Native Police along the Moira area of the Murray, down Mitta Mitta creek and along the Edward River. Other collisions also occurred near Tongala. Further down the Murray, punitive operations were also conducted near McLeod's station in 1846, Lake Bael Bael in 1846 and around [[Swan Hill]] in 1850.

The closeness of the Border Police and the Native Police is demonstrated by officer Windredge who was employed in both forces in Gippsland. In 1845 and 1846, Tyers led extensive punitive raids with his forces around [[Lake Wellington]], up the Avon River and down to the Lakes region.<ref name=\"unimelb1986\"/>\n\nIn late 1846 and early 1847, in a horrible example of British colonial values, a rumour began that a shipwrecked [[white woman of Gippsland|white woman]] had been abducted by a Gunai clan. Outraged Victorian sensibility demanded both the rescue of the supposed damsel and the wholesale punishment of the natives involved. A special Native Police mission was organised in September 1846 under HEP Dana that failed to produce the white woman. A private posse of 10 armed Aboriginals and 6 whites was then organised under de Villiers which also did not produce the woman. The rumour of the white woman was proved false, but the results for the Gunai were devastating. Tyers estimated that the two punitive groups killed at least 50 Aboriginals and wounded many more.<ref name=\"unimelb1986\"/>\n\nAt the same time, more regular combined Native and Border Police operations resulted in mass killings of [[Gunai people|Gunai]] around Boisdale and on the MacAllister River. There was a large punitive operation in late 1846 at the mouth of the [[Snowy River]] involving the forces being split into 3 groups to surround and engage aboriginals residing in the estuary area. The Native Police Corps then continued upstream along the river.<ref>Public Records Office Victoria, ''[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/nativepolice/gippsland_clashes.html Gippsland Clashes \u2013 Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904225133/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/nativepolice/gippsland_clashes.html |date=4 September 2008 }}''.

This culminated in 1840 with the murders of a white woman and her child in York.  [[John Nicol Drummond]], a young man who had grown up amongst Aboriginal people in the areas of the Swan and Helena Valleys, was able to capture the perpetrator due to his knowledge of the local tribespeople. As a result, in August 1840 Drummond was rewarded with the title of Inspector in the newly formed Native Police.  The Western Australian Native Police was smaller than those of other colonies in that usually only 2 or 3 mounted aboriginal constables were attached to the white officer. It was also different in that the officers were given monetary rewards for capturing wanted people and that they were placed under the control of the Native Protector. However, extrajudicial killings by the police upon Aboriginal people still occurred during the 1840s. The force also became less formalised in its command structure to the point where, in 1854, Drummond concurrently held the positions of Native Protector, magistrate and Superintendent of Police in the [[Champion Bay]] area.  This situation gave Drummond complete freedom to subdue the natives around [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] in whatever method he deemed appropriate and a massacre of Aboriginals conducted by the police and armed stockholders at Bootenal swamp near [[Greenough, Western Australia|Greenough]] was the result.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pashley|first1=A.

Marshall, with the native troopers and contingents of armed stockmen, conducted punitive raids at Tieryboo, Wallan, Booranga and Copranoranbilla Lagoon, shooting Aboriginals and destroying their camps.

Dispersals of large numbers of Aborigines occurred at Dalgangal, Mary River, Toomcul, Goondiwindi and at various places along the Maranoa River. Governor Fitzroy noted in the 1851 end of year report that a great many blacks were killed, however no official action was taken to change the aggressive functioning of the Native Police.<ref name=\"Police of the Pastoral Frontier\"/>\n\n===Fraser Island===\nThe magistrate of the newly established town of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], E. B. Uhr, requested significant assistance from the Native Police to rid the area of \"troublesome blacks\". Nearby [[Fraser Island]] was viewed as a sanctuary for these Aboriginals (the [[Badtjala language|Badtjala]] people) which must be breached in order to force them into submission. In February 1851, Walker rendezvoused with the divisions of Marshall and Fulford in Maryborough to formulate a plan of attack. Uhr issued them with the warrants for the arrest of 36 Aborigines and Walker understood that a large force was needed to smash any resistance. After written consultation with authorities in Sydney, Walker received advice from Attorney General Plunkett that the warrants were legal, that war-like casualties were acceptable in this case and that the enlisting of special constables (ie.armed volunteers) to assist in the mission was allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=L.E.|title=Police of the Pastoral Frontier|date=1975|page=46|publisher=UQP|location=St Lucia}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until late December 1851 that the force was ready to invade Fraser Island. Walker, Marshall, Doolan with their three divisions of troopers, together with local landholders the Leith Hay brothers and Mr Wilmot set out down the Mary River aboard Captain Currie's ''Margaret and Mary'' schooner. Aboriginals in a stolen dinghy were shot along the way and the boat seized. The force landed on the west coast of the island where the divisions split up to scour the region. Marshall's section shot a number of Badtjala and captured several. Bad weather hampered operations and Commandant Walker subsequently allowed his division to track down other groups of Badtjala without him. This group chased the local Aboriginals across to the east coast where they mustered them into the ocean.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3709051 |title=To the Editor of the Moreton Bay Courier. |newspaper=The Moreton Bay Courier |volume=VII |issue=327 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=18 September 1852 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The force returned to Maryborough in early January 1852 and Captain Currie received a reward of \u00a310 for his contribution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=L.E.|title=Police of the Pastoral Frontier|date=1975|page=64|publisher=UQP|location=St Lucia}}</ref>\n\n===Consolidation of the Native Police===\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 47804 Inspector John Murray, Native Police, ca. 1866.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]]]]\nThe year 1852 saw further recruitment and expansion of the Native Police to 8 divisions. Forty-eight new troopers were signed up mostly from the northern inland rivers of NSW. Lieutenant [[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]] was appointed to the 4th Division, Lieut. Blandford to the 3rd Division and Sergeants Skelton, Pincolt and Richard A. Dempster were also appointed as officers in charge of other divisions.  The Traylan barracks on the Burnett River near the now-abandoned site of Ceratodus, north of present-day Eidsvold, was established while the other major barracks, besides Callandoon, was at Wondai Gumbal near [[Yuleba]]. Sgt. Dempster was responsible for several large scale dispersals in 1852. The first was at [[Wallumbilla, Queensland|Wallumbilla]] where an ex-trooper named Priam and a number of others were shot dead. Dempster then traveled to Ogilvie's Wachoo station near [[St. George, Queensland|St. George]] and shot a large number of Aboriginals with the aid of a man named Johnson who was the superintendent of the property. Johnson also shot dead a white storeperson in a \"friendly fire\" incident during this dispersal. Dempster, having fallen sick, then allowed Johnson to take charge of his division and lead it to Yamboukal (modern-day [[Surat, Queensland|Surat]]) where a lot of [[Mandandanji]] working peacefully on this pastoral station were subsequently killed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13002464 |title=PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXVIII |issue=6057 |date=4 November 1857 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> As a result of this, Dempster was suspended for 3 months.

Native Police were also employed tracking down Chinese coolie labourers who had run away from the stations of powerful squatter capitalists such as [[Gordon Sandeman]].\n\n===Deployment to Port Curtis===\nIn 1853 several new Sub-Lieutenants were appointed including [[John O'Connell Bligh]], [[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset]], Frederick Keen, Samuel Crummer, Francis Nicoll and Frederick Walker's brother Robert G. Walker.  Dispersals and shootings continued throughout the settled districts including along the Balonne, Dawson, Burnett and Maranoa Rivers. These war-like missions were discussed openly and condoned in the contemporary Australian press. For instance, the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] described the operations of Lieutenants Marshall and John Murray along the Burnett River as \"taking and shooting host of murderers, never stopping, never tiring..a perfect light dragoon, best skirmishers of any troops in the world..loading and firing with the precision of an old soldier\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12945702 |title=WIDE BAY THE BURNETT DISTRICT. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXIV |issue=4987 |date=11 May 1853 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |page=2 (Supplement to the SMH) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of these paramilitary interventions, the British pastoral invasion of the country was enabled to continue. New barracks were built at [[Rannes, Queensland|Rannes]], [[Wallaville|Walla]] and at Swanson's Yabba station at the top of [[Yabba Falls]]. Squatters Holt and Hay pursued an overland path to the taking up of lands toward [[Port Curtis]]. Two men accompanying them were killed by Aboriginals and as a consequence, the 1st Division of Native Police under Commandant Walker was sent into the area to \"have a month's sharp shooting\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article668707 |title=Sydney News. |newspaper=The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser |volume=XI |issue=934 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 June 1853 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Additionally, Lieutenant [[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]] and the 3rd Division with the troopers of Sgt.

For instance, in 1852, after the murder of an American worker at [[Deniliquin]], Sergeant O'Halloran from [[Moulamein]] imported both native and white troopers from Victoria to shoot Aboriginals as a collective punishment. His force drove a camp of people, most of them older women and children, across the Edward River, fatally wounding 2 women and a child.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114835766 |title=(To The Editor's of the Freeman's Journal.) |newspaper=Freeman's Journal |volume=III |issue=112 |location=New South Wales|date=12 August 1852 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nBy 1853, 12 troopers of Native Police were officially stationed in the [[Murrumbidgee District]] under the command of the local Commissioner for Crown Lands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61327646 |title=WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=830 |location=New South Wales|date=8 September 1853 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The need for native troopers in this region was soon deemed superfluous and the government dissolved this detachment in 1857.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28637048 |title=LOWER MURRUMBIDGEE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXVIII |issue=5855 |date=10 March 1857 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, the Murrumbidgee was still utilised as a recruitment area for troopers to fight in Queensland with Lieut.

With the force in a weakened state, aboriginal resistance became more bold.

Walker's division. Mt. Larcom station was also attacked around this time, resulting in the deaths of five station-hands. Multiple punitive missions were conducted by John Murray and R. G.

New officers such as Moorhead, Thomas Ross, [[Walter David Taylor Powell]], Francis Allman, Evan Williams, Frederick Carr and Charles Phibbs were appointed. In May 1857, the vacant position of Commandant was filled by E.N.V. Morisset and the headquarters of the Native Police was shifted from Traylan to [[Owanyilla, Queensland|Cooper's Plains]] just west of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]]. However, even with this reorganisation, strong indigenous resistance continued.\n\n===Attacks at Miriam Vale, Eurombah and Hornet Bank===\nAfter an aboriginal ambush at Miriam Vale near Gladstone, it was determined that [[Curtis Island (Queensland)|Curtis Island]] (like Fraser Island previously) was a safehaven for natives that should be breached. 2nd Lieutenant R. G. Walker organised a seaborne punitive expedition that included several troopers, 2nd Lieut. W. D. T. Powell and local squatters J. Landsborough and Ranken.

This was, at the time, the largest loss of British life in conflict on the Australian frontier and with the concurrent [[Indian Mutiny]] threatening the basis of British global colonisation, the military response was predictably merciless. Officer W. D. T. Powell was the first Native Police officer to arrive and immediately tracked down and killed at least eight Aboriginals. Multiple punitive missions conducted in the subsequent months under Powell, Carr and Moorhead killed at least 70 aboriginals. These shootings were blantantly indiscriminate with [[Walter David Taylor Powell|W. D. T.

The official narrative beforehand was that frontier killings or dispersals were necessary to maintain a peace between white and black. The force under Commandants Walker and Marshall, while undoubtedly involved in many summary mass killings, pursued the method of encouraging squatters to allow aboriginals to be retained on the property. However, after Hornet Bank, the views of powerful squatter politicians such as [[William Forster (Australian politician)|William Forster]], [[Gordon Sandeman]] and [[Charles Cowper]] became official Native Police policy. This involved encouraging squatters in frontier regions to \"keep the blacks out\" and consequently the Native Police became an indisputable vehicle of deliberate [[ethnic cleansing]].\n\nAnother government inquiry in Sydney was ordered in July 1858 which concluded with the recommendation that \"there is no alternative but to carry matters through with a strong hand and punish with necessary severity all future outrages\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=NSW Legislative Assembly|title=1858 Report from the Select Committee on the Murders by the Aborigines on the Dawson River|url=http://www.kathystavrou.net/caught-in-the-act/1858-SCRep-dawson-murders.html|accessdate=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804113718/http://www.kathystavrou.net/caught-in-the-act/1858-SCRep-dawson-murders.html|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> New officers were appointed including Frederick Wheeler and [[George Poultney Malcolm Murray]] and in August, Commandant [[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset|Edric Morisset]] organised a large combined force of 17 troopers under Phibbs, Carr and G.P.M.

[[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset|E.N.V. Morisset]], in addition to retaining his role as Commandant of the Native Police, also became the Inspector General of Police in the new colony. The Native Police had even less checks and balances than it did previously in this new administration. Morisset appointed new officers such as A.M.G. Patrick, A.F. Matveieff, J.T. Baker as well as his own brother Rudolph S. Morisset.\n \nThe Native Police Force that operated in Queensland was the longest operating force of its kind in colonial Australian history. It was arguably also the most controversial. Its mode of operation cannot by any standard be classified as \"law enforcement\". From the period 1859 onward to the 1890s there are no signs that this force was engaged in anything but general punitive expeditions, commonly performed as deadly daybreak attacks on Aboriginal camps. All signs are that the force generally took no prisoners at the frontier and in the few cases on record when this did happen these prisoners were on record as having been shot during attempts to escape.<ref>''The Way We Civilize'' editorials and articles authored and edited by Carl Feilberg and printed in the ''Brisbane Courier'' (and its weekly ''The Queenslander'') between March and December 1880 and in the form of a pamphlet. see also L.

Gregson and other squatters were involved in the initial punitive raids after the massacre, with Lieutenant Cave being the first Native Police officer on the scene not long after. He was soon joined by officers [[George Poultney Malcolm Murray|G.P.M. Murray]], Morehead and the Commandant [[John O'Connell Bligh]], and together they conducted a number of shooting patrols.

Administration of the police, including that of the paramilitary Native Police, became centralised in Brisbane under the command of the [[Queensland Police Commissioner]]. The role of Commandant of the Native Police was abolished and the title of Lieutenant was replaced with Inspector. Although these changes to the Native Police appeared to give the force a more civilian role, in reality it remained a brutal instrument of enforcing British control in the colony. The new Commissioner, [[David Thompson Seymour]], took up the position after resigning from the role of commanding officer of the [[British Army]] detachment in Queensland.

They found that the trial was a success with an almost complete reduction in the spearing of cattle and settler casualties. Leading officials of the Queensland government, in particular the Colonial Secretary [[Horace Tozer]], opted to expand the funding of the rationing experiment. As a result, the Native Police budget was dramatically reduced with only 45 troopers and a handful of officers being employed in 1895. 1895 also saw [[David Thompson Seymour]], the long serving [[Queensland Police Commissioner]] who commanded the exterminating operations of the Native Police for thirty years, replaced with the more moderate [[William Parry-Okeden]]. Also in that year, Tozer commissioned [[Archibald Meston]] to conduct a thorough research report into the condition of Aboriginals in the colony. Meston recommended the often discussed proposal of segregating Aboriginals from white society and forcibly detaining them on isolated reserves. This report was largely accepted by the government and led to the passing of the [[Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897|Aboriginal Protection Act of 1897]]. For most Aboriginals in the colony of Queensland, this meant that they faced a reduced likelihood of being shot but also had almost all aspects of their lives controlled by the government. Even though Meston recommended the immediate disbanding of the Native Police, this aspect was rejected with Native Police units continuing to operate out of a number of barracks on the [[Cape York Peninsula]] and in the [[Gulf Country]].<ref>{{Citation | author1=Loos, Noel | title=Invasion and resistance : Aboriginal-European relations on the North Queensland frontier 1861\u20131897 | date=2017 | publisher=Boolarong Press | isbn=978-1-925522-60-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Operations from 1890 to 1905===\n[[File:Nativepolicemusgrave.jpg|thumb|left|Native Police with constables Bateman and Whiteford at [[Musgrave, Queensland|Musgrave]] barracks around 1898]]\nDespite many Native Police troopers in this period being decommissioned or redeployed as unarmed trackers working with normal police squads and, in addition, a considerable number of barracks being turned into so-called \"feeding stations\" for the local remnant Aboriginal population,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81618603 |title=HOW THE BLACKS ARE FED. |newspaper=[[The North Queensland Register]] |volume=VII |issue=38 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=13 October 1897 |accessdate=18 January 2019 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> intense dispersal operations still continued in the Cape York and Gulf districts.\n\nIn 1893, a very large group consisting of 20 Native Police troopers led by sub-Inspector Charles Savage, together with armed settlers and other police were sent on a punitive mission against Aboriginals living around the [[Ducie River]] in the far north.

In 1891, two Aboriginal men were 'shot whilst attempting to escape'. The deaths were noticed and the South Australian Register called for an Enquiry to establish whether or not police had been justified in killing the two Aboriginal men.  \n \nEventually, F. J. Gillen, Telegraph Stationmaster and Justice of the Peace at Alice Springs, received instructions from the Government to investigate the matter and report to the Attorney-General. Gillen found Willshire responsible for ordering the killings. At the conclusion of Gillen's investigation, Willshire was suspended, arrested and charged with murder.

By 1840 the Border Police became the main replacement for the NSW Mounted Police along the frontier, while the Native Police Corps, as the Aboriginal force was known, was limited initially to one division in the [[Port Phillip District]] of the colony, around [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]].

It was disbanded briefly in January 1838 but reorganised in April of the same year with their new headquarters in Jolimont where the MCG carpark is now situated.  Due to funding problems, the force was again dissolved in 1839. These issues delayed reformation of the corps until Superintendent [[Charles La Trobe]] indicated he was willing to underwrite the costs in 1842.<ref name=\"ellender\" /> A significant factor in the restoration of the force was the successful capture of five Tasmanian aboriginal people near [[Westernport, Victoria|Westernport]] in 1840 by local Aboriginal men who were attached to a party of [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]] and soldiers.\n\n[[File:Victorian Native Police.jpg|thumb|left|Native Police of Port Phillip, 1850]]\n[[Henry EP Dana]] was selected to command the corps in 1842.

Once in these areas, the troopers and their officers were placed under the command of the local Commissioner for Crown Lands, who would then seek out and capture or destroy the dissident groups and individuals. In addition to Native Police, the Commissioner also had the troopers of the Border Police and NSW Mounted Police as well as armed volunteer settlers at his disposal to conduct punitive raids on Aboriginal people.<ref name=\"unimelb1986\">{{cite journal|last1=Fels|first1=M.

Divisions of the Native Police would be deployed to these areas in the winter of each year until 1852 and spend the rest of the year mostly garrisoned at the Narre Narre Warren barracks.

In 1843 and 1844, Commissioner Smythe led large punitive missions with forces including Native Police along the Moira area of the Murray, down Mitta Mitta creek and along the Edward River. Other collisions also occurred near Tongala. Further down the Murray, punitive operations were also conducted near McLeod's station in 1846, Lake Bael Bael in 1846 and around [[Swan Hill]] in 1850.

The closeness of the Border Police and the Native Police is demonstrated by officer Windredge who was employed in both forces in Gippsland. In 1845 and 1846, Tyers led extensive punitive raids with his forces around [[Lake Wellington]], up the Avon River and down to the Lakes region.<ref name=\"unimelb1986\"/>\n\nIn late 1846 and early 1847, in a horrible example of British colonial values, a rumour began that a shipwrecked [[white woman of Gippsland|white woman]] had been abducted by a Gunai clan. Outraged Victorian sensibility demanded both the rescue of the supposed damsel and the wholesale punishment of the natives involved. A special Native Police mission was organised in September 1846 under HEP Dana that failed to produce the white woman. A private posse of 10 armed Aboriginals and 6 whites was then organised under de Villiers which also did not produce the woman. The rumour of the white woman was proved false, but the results for the Gunai were devastating. Tyers estimated that the two punitive groups killed at least 50 Aboriginals and wounded many more.<ref name=\"unimelb1986\"/>\n\nAt the same time, more regular combined Native and Border Police operations resulted in mass killings of [[Gunai people|Gunai]] around Boisdale and on the MacAllister River. There was a large punitive operation in late 1846 at the mouth of the [[Snowy River]] involving the forces being split into 3 groups to surround and engage aboriginals residing in the estuary area. The Native Police Corps then continued upstream along the river.<ref>Public Records Office Victoria, ''[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/nativepolice/gippsland_clashes.html Gippsland Clashes \u2013 Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904225133/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/nativepolice/gippsland_clashes.html |date=4 September 2008 }}''.

This culminated in 1840 with the murders of a white woman and her child in York.  [[John Nicol Drummond]], a young man who had grown up amongst Aboriginal people in the areas of the Swan and Helena Valleys, was able to capture the perpetrator due to his knowledge of the local tribespeople. As a result, in August 1840 Drummond was rewarded with the title of Inspector in the newly formed Native Police.  The Western Australian Native Police was smaller than those of other colonies in that usually only 2 or 3 mounted aboriginal constables were attached to the white officer. It was also different in that the officers were given monetary rewards for capturing wanted people and that they were placed under the control of the Native Protector. However, extrajudicial killings by the police upon Aboriginal people still occurred during the 1840s. The force also became less formalised in its command structure to the point where, in 1854, Drummond concurrently held the positions of Native Protector, magistrate and Superintendent of Police in the [[Champion Bay]] area.  This situation gave Drummond complete freedom to subdue the natives around [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] in whatever method he deemed appropriate and a massacre of Aboriginals conducted by the police and armed stockholders at Bootenal swamp near [[Greenough, Western Australia|Greenough]] was the result.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pashley|first1=A.

Marshall, with the native troopers and contingents of armed stockmen, conducted punitive raids at Tieryboo, Wallan, Booranga and Copranoranbilla Lagoon, shooting Aboriginals and destroying their camps.

Dispersals of large numbers of Aborigines occurred at Dalgangal, Mary River, Toomcul, Goondiwindi and at various places along the Maranoa River. Governor Fitzroy noted in the 1851 end of year report that a great many blacks were killed, however no official action was taken to change the aggressive functioning of the Native Police.<ref name=\"Police of the Pastoral Frontier\"/>\n\n===Fraser Island===\nThe magistrate of the newly established town of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], E. B. Uhr, requested significant assistance from the Native Police to rid the area of \"troublesome blacks\". Nearby [[Fraser Island]] was viewed as a sanctuary for these Aboriginals (the [[Badtjala language|Badtjala]] people) which must be breached in order to force them into submission. In February 1851, Walker rendezvoused with the divisions of Marshall and Fulford in Maryborough to formulate a plan of attack. Uhr issued them with the warrants for the arrest of 36 Aborigines and Walker understood that a large force was needed to smash any resistance. After written consultation with authorities in Sydney, Walker received advice from Attorney General Plunkett that the warrants were legal, that war-like casualties were acceptable in this case and that the enlisting of special constables (ie.armed volunteers) to assist in the mission was allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=L.E.|title=Police of the Pastoral Frontier|date=1975|page=46|publisher=UQP|location=St Lucia}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until late December 1851 that the force was ready to invade Fraser Island. Walker, Marshall, Doolan with their three divisions of troopers, together with local landholders the Leith Hay brothers and Mr Wilmot set out down the Mary River aboard Captain Currie's ''Margaret and Mary'' schooner. Aboriginals in a stolen dinghy were shot along the way and the boat seized. The force landed on the west coast of the island where the divisions split up to scour the region. Marshall's section shot a number of Badtjala and captured several. Bad weather hampered operations and Commandant Walker subsequently allowed his division to track down other groups of Badtjala without him. This group chased the local Aboriginals across to the east coast where they mustered them into the ocean.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3709051 |title=To the Editor of the Moreton Bay Courier. |newspaper=The Moreton Bay Courier |volume=VII |issue=327 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=18 September 1852 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The force returned to Maryborough in early January 1852 and Captain Currie received a reward of \u00a310 for his contribution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=L.E.|title=Police of the Pastoral Frontier|date=1975|page=64|publisher=UQP|location=St Lucia}}</ref>\n\n===Consolidation of the Native Police===\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 47804 Inspector John Murray, Native Police, ca. 1866.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]]]]\nThe year 1852 saw further recruitment and expansion of the Native Police to 8 divisions. Forty-eight new troopers were signed up mostly from the northern inland rivers of NSW. Lieutenant [[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]] was appointed to the 4th Division, Lieut. Blandford to the 3rd Division and Sergeants Skelton, Pincolt and Richard A. Dempster were also appointed as officers in charge of other divisions.  The Traylan barracks on the Burnett River near the now-abandoned site of Ceratodus, north of present-day Eidsvold, was established while the other major barracks, besides Callandoon, was at Wondai Gumbal near [[Yuleba]]. Sgt. Dempster was responsible for several large scale dispersals in 1852. The first was at [[Wallumbilla, Queensland|Wallumbilla]] where an ex-trooper named Priam and a number of others were shot dead. Dempster then traveled to Ogilvie's Wachoo station near [[St. George, Queensland|St. George]] and shot a large number of Aboriginals with the aid of a man named Johnson who was the superintendent of the property. Johnson also shot dead a white storeperson in a \"friendly fire\" incident during this dispersal. Dempster, having fallen sick, then allowed Johnson to take charge of his division and lead it to Yamboukal (modern-day [[Surat, Queensland|Surat]]) where a lot of [[Mandandanji]] working peacefully on this pastoral station were subsequently killed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13002464 |title=PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXVIII |issue=6057 |date=4 November 1857 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> As a result of this, Dempster was suspended for 3 months.

Native Police were also employed tracking down Chinese coolie labourers who had run away from the stations of powerful squatter capitalists such as [[Gordon Sandeman]].\n\n===Deployment to Port Curtis===\nIn 1853 several new Sub-Lieutenants were appointed including [[John O'Connell Bligh]], [[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset]], Frederick Keen, Samuel Crummer, Francis Nicoll and Frederick Walker's brother Robert G. Walker.  Dispersals and shootings continued throughout the settled districts including along the Balonne, Dawson, Burnett and Maranoa Rivers. These war-like missions were discussed openly and condoned in the contemporary Australian press. For instance, the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] described the operations of Lieutenants Marshall and John Murray along the Burnett River as \"taking and shooting host of murderers, never stopping, never tiring..a perfect light dragoon, best skirmishers of any troops in the world..loading and firing with the precision of an old soldier\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12945702 |title=WIDE BAY THE BURNETT DISTRICT. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXIV |issue=4987 |date=11 May 1853 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |page=2 (Supplement to the SMH) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of these paramilitary interventions, the British pastoral invasion of the country was enabled to continue. New barracks were built at [[Rannes, Queensland|Rannes]], [[Wallaville|Walla]] and at Swanson's Yabba station at the top of [[Yabba Falls]]. Squatters Holt and Hay pursued an overland path to the taking up of lands toward [[Port Curtis]]. Two men accompanying them were killed by Aboriginals and as a consequence, the 1st Division of Native Police under Commandant Walker was sent into the area to \"have a month's sharp shooting\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article668707 |title=Sydney News. |newspaper=The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser |volume=XI |issue=934 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 June 1853 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Additionally, Lieutenant [[John Murray (native police officer)|John Murray]] and the 3rd Division with the troopers of Sgt.

For instance, in 1852, after the murder of an American worker at [[Deniliquin]], Sergeant O'Halloran from [[Moulamein]] imported both native and white troopers from Victoria to shoot Aboriginals as a collective punishment. His force drove a camp of people, most of them older women and children, across the Edward River, fatally wounding 2 women and a child.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114835766 |title=(To The Editor's of the Freeman's Journal.) |newspaper=Freeman's Journal |volume=III |issue=112 |location=New South Wales|date=12 August 1852 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nBy 1853, 12 troopers of Native Police were officially stationed in the [[Murrumbidgee District]] under the command of the local Commissioner for Crown Lands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61327646 |title=WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=830 |location=New South Wales|date=8 September 1853 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The need for native troopers in this region was soon deemed superfluous and the government dissolved this detachment in 1857.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28637048 |title=LOWER MURRUMBIDGEE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXVIII |issue=5855 |date=10 March 1857 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, the Murrumbidgee was still utilised as a recruitment area for troopers to fight in Queensland with Lieut.

With the force in a weakened state, aboriginal resistance became more bold.

Walker's division. Mt. Larcom station was also attacked around this time, resulting in the deaths of five station-hands. Multiple punitive missions were conducted by John Murray and R. G.

New officers such as Moorhead, Thomas Ross, [[Walter David Taylor Powell]], Francis Allman, Evan Williams, Frederick Carr and Charles Phibbs were appointed. In May 1857, the vacant position of Commandant was filled by E.N.V. Morisset and the headquarters of the Native Police was shifted from Traylan to [[Owanyilla, Queensland|Cooper's Plains]] just west of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]]. However, even with this reorganisation, strong indigenous resistance continued.\n\n===Attacks at Miriam Vale, Eurombah and Hornet Bank===\nAfter an aboriginal ambush at Miriam Vale near Gladstone, it was determined that [[Curtis Island (Queensland)|Curtis Island]] (like Fraser Island previously) was a safehaven for natives that should be breached. 2nd Lieutenant R. G. Walker organised a seaborne punitive expedition that included several troopers, 2nd Lieut. W. D. T. Powell and local squatters J. Landsborough and Ranken.

This was, at the time, the largest loss of British life in conflict on the Australian frontier and with the concurrent [[Indian Mutiny]] threatening the basis of British global colonisation, the military response was predictably merciless. Officer W. D. T. Powell was the first Native Police officer to arrive and immediately tracked down and killed at least eight Aboriginals. Multiple punitive missions conducted in the subsequent months under Powell, Carr and Moorhead killed at least 70 aboriginals. These shootings were blantantly indiscriminate with [[Walter David Taylor Powell|W. D. T.

The official narrative beforehand was that frontier killings or dispersals were necessary to maintain a peace between white and black. The force under Commandants Walker and Marshall, while undoubtedly involved in many summary mass killings, pursued the method of encouraging squatters to allow aboriginals to be retained on the property. However, after Hornet Bank, the views of powerful squatter politicians such as [[William Forster (Australian politician)|William Forster]], [[Gordon Sandeman]] and [[Charles Cowper]] became official Native Police policy. This involved encouraging squatters in frontier regions to \"keep the blacks out\" and consequently the Native Police became an indisputable vehicle of deliberate [[ethnic cleansing]].\n\nAnother government inquiry in Sydney was ordered in July 1858 which concluded with the recommendation that \"there is no alternative but to carry matters through with a strong hand and punish with necessary severity all future outrages\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=NSW Legislative Assembly|title=1858 Report from the Select Committee on the Murders by the Aborigines on the Dawson River|url=http://www.kathystavrou.net/caught-in-the-act/1858-SCRep-dawson-murders.html|accessdate=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804113718/http://www.kathystavrou.net/caught-in-the-act/1858-SCRep-dawson-murders.html|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> New officers were appointed including Frederick Wheeler and [[George Poultney Malcolm Murray]] and in August, Commandant [[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset|Edric Morisset]] organised a large combined force of 17 troopers under Phibbs, Carr and G.P.M.

[[Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset|E.N.V. Morisset]], in addition to retaining his role as Commandant of the Native Police, also became the Inspector General of Police in the new colony. The Native Police had even less checks and balances than it did previously in this new administration. Morisset appointed new officers such as A.M.G. Patrick, A.F. Matveieff, J.T. Baker as well as his own brother Rudolph S. Morisset.\n \nThe Native Police Force that operated in Queensland was the longest operating force of its kind in colonial Australian history. It was arguably also the most controversial. Its mode of operation cannot by any standard be classified as \"law enforcement\". From the period 1859 onward to the 1890s there are no signs that this force was engaged in anything but general punitive expeditions, commonly performed as deadly daybreak attacks on Aboriginal camps. All signs are that the force generally took no prisoners at the frontier and in the few cases on record when this did happen these prisoners were on record as having been shot during attempts to escape.<ref>''The Way We Civilize'' editorials and articles authored and edited by Carl Feilberg and printed in the ''Brisbane Courier'' (and its weekly ''The Queenslander'') between March and December 1880 and in the form of a pamphlet. see also L.

Gregson and other squatters were involved in the initial punitive raids after the massacre, with Lieutenant Cave being the first Native Police officer on the scene not long after. He was soon joined by officers [[George Poultney Malcolm Murray|G.P.M. Murray]], Morehead and the Commandant [[John O'Connell Bligh]], and together they conducted a number of shooting patrols.

Administration of the police, including that of the paramilitary Native Police, became centralised in Brisbane under the command of the [[Queensland Police Commissioner]]. The role of Commandant of the Native Police was abolished and the title of Lieutenant was replaced with Inspector. Although these changes to the Native Police appeared to give the force a more civilian role, in reality it remained a brutal instrument of enforcing British control in the colony. The new Commissioner, [[David Thompson Seymour]], took up the position after resigning from the role of commanding officer of the [[British Army]] detachment in Queensland.

They found that the trial was a success with an almost complete reduction in the spearing of cattle and settler casualties. Leading officials of the Queensland government, in particular the Colonial Secretary [[Horace Tozer]], opted to expand the funding of the rationing experiment. As a result, the Native Police budget was dramatically reduced with only 45 troopers and a handful of officers being employed in 1895. 1895 also saw [[David Thompson Seymour]], the long serving [[Queensland Police Commissioner]] who commanded the exterminating operations of the Native Police for thirty years, replaced with the more moderate [[William Parry-Okeden]]. Also in that year, Tozer commissioned [[Archibald Meston]] to conduct a thorough research report into the condition of Aboriginals in the colony. Meston recommended the often discussed proposal of segregating Aboriginals from white society and forcibly detaining them on isolated reserves. This report was largely accepted by the government and led to the passing of the [[Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897|Aboriginal Protection Act of 1897]]. For most Aboriginals in the colony of Queensland, this meant that they faced a reduced likelihood of being shot but also had almost all aspects of their lives controlled by the government. Even though Meston recommended the immediate disbanding of the Native Police, this aspect was rejected with Native Police units continuing to operate out of a number of barracks on the [[Cape York Peninsula]] and in the [[Gulf Country]].<ref>{{Citation | author1=Loos, Noel | title=Invasion and resistance : Aboriginal-European relations on the North Queensland frontier 1861\u20131897 | date=2017 | publisher=Boolarong Press | isbn=978-1-925522-60-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Operations from 1890 to 1905===\n[[File:Nativepolicemusgrave.jpg|thumb|left|Native Police with constables Bateman and Whiteford at [[Musgrave, Queensland|Musgrave]] barracks around 1898]]\nDespite many Native Police troopers in this period being decommissioned or redeployed as unarmed trackers working with normal police squads and, in addition, a considerable number of barracks being turned into so-called \"feeding stations\" for the local remnant Aboriginal population,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81618603 |title=HOW THE BLACKS ARE FED. |newspaper=[[The North Queensland Register]] |volume=VII |issue=38 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=13 October 1897 |accessdate=18 January 2019 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> intense dispersal operations still continued in the Cape York and Gulf districts.\n\nIn 1893, a very large group consisting of 20 Native Police troopers led by sub-Inspector Charles Savage, together with armed settlers and other police were sent on a punitive mission against Aboriginals living around the [[Ducie River]] in the far north.

The Native Police detachment based at Turn Off Lagoon conducted many of their punitive expeditions across the border in the Northern Territory. For instance, in 1896 after the killing of [[Cresswell Downs]] manager, Thomas Perry, this unit shot a large number of Aboriginals in that region. Indiscriminate dispersals also followed the spearing of Harry Shadforth at [[Wollogorang Station]] in 1897. Constables Richard Alford and Timothy Lyne were in charge of these troopers at this time. An Aboriginal boy named Oscar who was kidnapped from the [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]] area by Native Police and brought to work at Rocklands station near [[Camooweal]], made some unique recordings of the operations of the Native Police based at Turn Off Lagoon.

In 1891, two Aboriginal men were 'shot whilst attempting to escape'. The deaths were noticed and the South Australian Register called for an Enquiry to establish whether or not police had been justified in killing the two Aboriginal men.  \n \nEventually, F. J. Gillen, Telegraph Stationmaster and Justice of the Peace at Alice Springs, received instructions from the Government to investigate the matter and report to the Attorney-General. Gillen found Willshire responsible for ordering the killings. At the conclusion of Gillen's investigation, Willshire was suspended, arrested and charged with murder. He became the first Northern Territory police officer charged with this offence.  He was subsequently acquitted.<ref>Refer to Wilson, W.R.

Under [[common law]], the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest [[collateral descendant|collateral line]]. The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] restrict succession to the [[throne]] to the legitimate Protestant descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] who are in \"[[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Church of England]]\".<ref name=BM>{{cite web |title=Succession |url=https://www.royal.uk/succession |website=Official website of the Royal Family |language=en |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> Spouses of [[Roman Catholics]] were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015.

Next in line after him is [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is [[Prince George of Cambridge|Prince George]], the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge|Princess Charlotte]], and younger brother, [[Prince Louis of Cambridge|Prince Louis]]. Sixth in line is [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex]], the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the [[Perth Agreement]], which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.\n\nThe first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]]. Counsellors of State perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.\n\nThe United Kingdom is one of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Each of those countries has the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the realms [[Perth Agreement|agreed unanimously]] to adopt a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective [[The Crown|Crowns]] so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement, instead of [[male-preference primogeniture]], and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the [[Church of England]]. After the necessary legislation had been enacted in accordance with each realm's constitution, the changes took effect on 26 March 2015.\n\n==Current line of succession==\n{| border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; border:1px solid #aaa; background:#f9f9f9; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#CCBBEE; font-size: 95%; color:#000066; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 0 5px 0 5px; text-align:center;\" colspan=2|First six in line<ref group=\"n\">{{cite web |title=Succession to the Crown Act 2013, s. 3 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/section/3/enacted |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |quote=\"A person who (when the person marries) is one of the 6 persons next in the line of succession to the Crown must obtain the consent of Her Majesty before marrying.\"}}</ref>from 23 April 2018\n|-\n|1.

Richard was the last king of the [[House of York]], and the last of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]]. Henry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his victory over Richard at Bosworth Field,<ref>Chrimes, S. B. (1999).

Ward, Lock, Bowden & Co. p. 298.</ref>\n\nHenry VII was followed by his son, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Though his father descended from the Lancastrians, Henry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother [[Elizabeth of York|Elizabeth]] was the sister and heiress of [[Edward V of England|Edward V]]. In 1542 Henry also assumed the title [[King of Ireland]]; this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and later Great Britain, until the [[Acts of Union 1800]] merged the separate crowns into that of the United Kingdom.\n\nHenry VIII's numerous marriages led to several complications over succession. Henry VIII was first married to [[Catherine of Aragon]], by whom he had a daughter named [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. His second marriage, to [[Anne Boleyn]], resulted in a daughter named [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. Henry VIII had a son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], by his third wife, [[Jane Seymour]]. An Act of Parliament passed in 1533 declared Mary illegitimate; another passed in 1536 did the same for Elizabeth. Though the two remained illegitimate, an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 allowed reinserting them, providing further \"that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign, appoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises \u2026 by [[letters patent]] or last will in writing.\" Mary and Elizabeth, under [[Will of Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's will]], were to be followed by descendants of the King's deceased sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk]] (he, however, excluded his niece [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk]]). This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of Henry's eldest sister [[Margaret Tudor]], who were the rulers of [[Scotland]].\n[[File:Elizabeth I in Parliament.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen Elizabeth I enthroned in Parliament]]\n\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, the young Edward succeeded him, becoming Edward VI. Edward VI was the first Protestant Sovereign to succeed to the rule of England. He attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to prevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He excluded Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, [[Lady Jane Grey]]. Jane was also originally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England. Nonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane's heirs-male, was amended to refer to Jane ''and'' her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI's death in 1553, Jane was proclaimed Queen of England and Ireland. She was not universally recognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As Henry VIII's will had been approved by an Act of Parliament in 1544, Edward's contravening will was unlawful and ignored.\n\nMary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst previous monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the [[Treasons Act 1571]] asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny Parliamentary authority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further passed the Act of Association 1584, which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding. (The Act was repealed in 1863.)\n\n===Scotland===\nThe [[House of Stuart|House of Stewart]] (later Stuart) had ruled in Scotland since 1371. It had followed strict rules of primogeniture until the deposition and exile of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]] in 1567; even then she was succeeded by her son, [[James VI and I|James VI]].\n\n===After the union of the crowns===\n\n====Stuarts====\nElizabeth I of England and Ireland was succeeded by King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]], her first cousin twice removed, even though his succession violated Henry VIII's will, under which [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven|Lady Anne Stanley]], heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was supposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to statutory provision, and as King of Scotland was powerful enough to deter any rival. He reigned as James I of England and Ireland, thus effecting the [[Union of the Crowns]], although England and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His succession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_1603 \"Succession to the Crown Act 1603\"].</ref>\n\n{{wide image|House of Stuart.png|850px|Principal members of the house of Stuart following the 1603 Union of the Crowns.|center}}\nJames's eldest surviving son and successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], was overthrown and beheaded in 1649. The monarchy itself was abolished. A few years later, it was replaced by the Protectorate under [[Oliver Cromwell]], effectively a monarch with the title of [[Lord Protector]] rather than King. Cromwell had the right to name his own successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by choosing his son, [[Richard Cromwell]]. Richard was ineffective, and was quickly forced from office. Shortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I's son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King.\n\n[[File:Wissing, Willem - Queen Anne, 1687.jpg|thumb|upright|After the death of her last child in 1700, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] became the last individual left in the line of succession determined by the Bill of Rights.]]\n[[James II of England|James II and VII]], a Roman Catholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s to [[Exclusion Crisis|exclude]] him in favour of Charles's illegitimate Protestant son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]. James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee from England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the realms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King's infant son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]] but to his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and to her husband [[William III of England|William]], who as James's nephew was the first person in the succession not descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance in British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland) and Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this unique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.\n\nThe English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right|Claim of Right Act]], both passed in 1689, determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish Thrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by any future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants were allowed to succeed to the Thrones, and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\n\nAfter Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own death in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was almost at an end; William and Mary never had any children, and Princess Anne's children had all died. Therefore, Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]. The Act maintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be succeeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own descendants from future marriages. The Act, however, declared that they would be followed by James I & VI's granddaughter [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]], Electress Dowager of Hanover (the daughter of James's daughter [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]]), and her heirs. As under the Bill of Rights, non-Protestants and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\n\n[[File:Kurfuerstin_Sophie.JPG|thumb|upright|Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630\u20131714)]]\nUpon William's death, Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. Because the Parliament of England settled on Sophia as Anne's heir-presumptive without consulting Scottish leaders, the [[Estates of Scotland]] retaliated by passing the Scottish [[Act of Security]]. The Act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would meet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same person as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic conditions were met. Anne originally withheld the [[Royal Assent]], but was forced to grant it when the Estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Queen's army. England's Parliament responded by passing the [[Alien Act 1705]], which threatened to cripple Scotland's economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little choice but to unite with England to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707; the Crown of the new nation (along with the Crown of Ireland) was subject to the rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.\n\n====Hanoverians and Windsors====\n[[Image:ProtestantTutor.png|left|upright|thumb|[[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris's]] ''Protestant Tutor'', a primer popular for decades and the source for the ''[[New England Primer]]''.

With Instructions for Grounding them in the True Protestant Religion.\"]]\nAnne was predeceased by Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover, and was therefore succeeded by the latter's son, who became [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714.\n\nAttempts were made in the [[Jacobite risings|risings of 1715 and 1745]] to restore Stuart claimants to the Throne, supported by those who recognised the [[Jacobite succession]]. The [[House of Hanover]] nonetheless remained undeposed, and the Crown descended in accordance with the appointed rules. In 1801, following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the separate crowns of Great Britain and Ireland were merged and became the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Between 1811 and 1820, when [[George III]] was deemed unfit to rule, the Prince of Wales (later [[George IV]]) acted as his [[Regency era|regent]]. Some years later the [[Regency Act 1830]] made provision for a change in the line of succession had a child been born to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] after his death, but this event did not come about.\n[[File:Coronation of George VI 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|George VI receiving [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] at his [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation]] in 1937]]\n\nOn the death of William IV in 1837, his 18-year-old niece [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] succeeded to the throne. After a 63-year reign, often known as the [[Victorian era]], she was succeeded in 1901 by her eldest son [[Edward VII]]. On his death, his second son acceded to the throne as [[George V]] (Edward's first son [[Prince Albert Victor]] died during an [[influenza pandemic]] in 1892).\n\n[[Edward VIII]] was proclaimed King on the death of his father, George V, in January 1936,<ref>{{cite news | publisher=UPI |location= London |date= 21 January 1936 |url =http://www.upi.com/Archives/1936/01/21/Prince-of-Wales-proclaimed-King-Edward-VIII/7807693511214/ | title = Prince of Wales proclaimed King Edward VIII }}</ref>  Edward [[State Opening of Parliament|opened Parliament]] in November, but abdicated in December 1936, and was never [[Abandoned coronation of Edward VIII|crowned]]. Edward had desired to marry [[Wallis Simpson]], a divorcee, but the [[Church of England]], of which the British Sovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorize the marriage of divorcees. Consequently, Parliament passed [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]], by which Edward VIII ceased to be Sovereign \"immediately upon\" his royal assent as King being signified in Parliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if any, were not to have any \"right, title or interest in or to the succession to the Throne\". Edward died childless in 1972.\n\nEdward's abdication was \"a [[demise of the Crown]]\" (in the words of the Act), and the [[Duke of York#Seventh creation, 1920\u20131936|Duke of York]], his brother who was then next in the line, immediately succeeded to the throne and to its \"rights, privileges, and dignities\", taking the [[regnal name]] George VI. He in turn was succeeded in 1952 by his own elder daughter, Elizabeth II. By that time the monarch of the United Kingdom no longer reigned in the greater part of Ireland (which had become a [[Republic of Ireland|republic]] in 1949), but was the monarch of a number of independent sovereign states (Commonwealth realms).\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\n{{Further|Perth Agreement}}\n[[File:Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II Couronnement de la Reine Elizabeth II.jpg|thumb|upright|Elizabeth II at her coronation in 1953, passing to the left of the [[Coronation Chair]]]]\n\nBy the terms of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], each of the Commonwealth realms has the same person as monarch and, to maintain that arrangement, they have agreed to continue the same line of succession; some realms do so through domestic succession laws, while others stipulate whoever is monarch of the United Kingdom will also be monarch of that realm. In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|was proclaimed]] as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In October 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|meeting]] held in Perth, Australia, to proposed changes to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession for people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute primogeniture\u2014wherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of sex\u2014instead of male-preference primogeniture. They also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics.

Royal Central. 26 March 2015.{{unreliable source?|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Current rules==\nThe Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union) still govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom by the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], which was passed mainly \"to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender\" and \"to make provision about Royal Marriages\" (according to its [[long title]]), thereby implementing the [[Perth Agreement]] in the UK and in those realms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is monarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.\n\nAnyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were dead. That person's descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally ineligible.\n\n===Marriages===\nThe [[Act of Settlement 1701]] provides that Protestant \"[[heirs of the body]]\" (that is, legitimate descendants) of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise disqualified. The meaning of ''heir of the body'' is determined by the common law rules of male preference [[primogeniture]] (the \"male-preference\" criterion is no longer applicable, in respect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011), whereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children, and a male child takes precedence over a female sibling.<ref>Blackstone (1765).</ref> Children born out of wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate children whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain ineligible to inherit the Crown.<ref group=n>Neither the [[Legitimacy Act 1926]] nor the [[Legitimacy Act 1959]] changed the Law of Succession.</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required descendants of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The requirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into foreign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII,<ref group=n>Per the [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]].</ref> of whom there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]] older than twenty-five years notified the Privy Council of his or her intention to marry without the consent of the Sovereign, then he or she may have lawfully done so after one year, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage. A marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the resulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the succession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected. This also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without permission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding on account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] attempted to marry the Roman Catholic [[Maria Anne Fitzherbert|Maria Fitzherbert]] in 1785 without obtaining permission from [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due course.<ref name=\"bogdanor_55\"/> A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void \"for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown\" under the 2013 act.<ref name=\"Act 2013\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/section/3 \"Succession to the Crown Act 2013\"]. UK Parliament. Section 3.</ref>\n\nThe constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII's decision to marry a divorcee in 1936 led to [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]], which provided that Edward VIII and his descendants would have no claim to the throne.<ref>His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, section 2</ref> The Act is no longer applicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.\n\nUnder the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the first six persons in line to the throne must obtain the sovereign's approval before marrying.<ref name=\"Act 2013\"/> Marriage without the Sovereign's consent disqualifies the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown,<ref name=\"Act 2013\"/> but the marriage is still legally valid.\n\n===Religion===\nRules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained under the Act of Settlement. The preamble to the Act of Settlement notes that the Bill of Rights provides \"that all and every person and persons that then [at the time of the Bill of Right's passage] were, or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with the [[Holy See|See or Church of Rome]], or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded.\"<ref>Act of Settlement, preamble</ref> The Act of Settlement continues, providing \"that all and every Person and Persons who shall \u2026 is, are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome or shall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a papist shall be subject to such Incapacities\"<ref>Act of Settlement, section 2</ref> as the Bill of Rights established. The clause precludes a Roman Catholic from succeeding to the throne.\n\nUnder the Act of Settlement the monarch is required to be in communion with the [[Church of England]],<ref name=BM/> so it is not only Catholics who are barred from the throne.\n\nThe Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman Catholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be Anglican; it only barred those who marry Roman Catholics. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the ban on individuals who marry Roman Catholics, though not on Roman Catholics themselves, because the monarch is Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\n===Treason===\nUnder the [[Treason Act 1702]] and the Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] to \"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding ... to the imperial crown of this realm\". Since the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], the maximum penalty has been life imprisonment.\n\n==Accession==\n[[File:St Jamess Palace.jpg|thumb|upright|The Accession Council normally meets in [[St James's Palace]] to proclaim the new sovereign.]]\nIn the Commonwealth realms, upon the death of a sovereign, the heir apparent or heir presumptive succeeds to the throne immediately, with no need for confirmation or further ceremony.<ref>[https://www.royal.uk/accession \"Accession\"].

The anniversary is observed throughout the sovereign's reign as [[Accession Day]], including royal [[gun salutes]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>[https://www.royal.uk/gun-salutes \"Gun Salutes\"]. Official website of the British Monarchy. Retrieved 7 May 2016.</ref>\n\nFormerly, a new sovereign proclaimed his or her own accession. But on the death of Elizabeth I an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of James I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as King James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the Accession Council normally meets in [[St James's Palace]]. Proclamations since James I's have usually been made in the name of the [[Lords Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]], the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]], [[Alderman|Aldermen]] and citizens of the [[City of London]] and \"other principal [[Gentleman|Gentlemen]] of quality\", though there have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nUpon his or her accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism.{{refn|group=\"n\"|This declaration was similar to what members of both Houses of Parliament were originally required to take by the Test Acts. Eventually, by the time it was changed in 1910, the monarch was the only one left required to make the declaration.}} This declaration, known as the [[Accession Declaration]], is required to be taken either at the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign (i.e. during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]) or at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of this declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be controversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and that he or she will \"uphold and maintain\" the Protestant succession.<ref>Accession Declaration Act 1910, schedule</ref> In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to \"maintain and preserve\" the Church of Scotland.<ref>Union with Scotland Act 1706, article XXV. \"...And Lastly that after the Decease of Her Present Majesty (whom God long preserve) the Soveraign succeeding to her in the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Great Britain shall in all time comeing at his or her accession to the Crown Swear and Subscribe That they shall inviolably maintain and preserve the foresaid settlement of the True Protestant Religion with the Government Worship Discipline Right and Priviledges of this Church as above established by the Laws of this Kingdom in prosecution of the Claim of Right...\"</ref> This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of the Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the [[Regency Act 1937]], should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon attainment of that age.<ref>Regency Act 1937, section 1(2)</ref>\n\nAfter a period of mourning,<ref name=\"royal.gov-coronation\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/coronation |title=Coronation |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref> the new sovereign is usually [[coronation of the British monarch|consecrated and crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Normally, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] officiates, though the sovereign may designate any other bishop of the [[Church of England]]. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, [[Edward VIII]] was [[Abandoned coronation of Edward VIII|never crowned]], yet during his short reign was the undoubted king.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Royalty|United Kingdom}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Accession Declaration Act 1910]]\n*[[Alternative successions of the English crown]]\n*[[British prince]]\n*[[British princess]]\n*[[Family tree of the British royal family]]\n*[[Jacobite succession]]\n*[[List of British monarchs]]\n*[[List of descendants of George V]]\n*[[List of heirs to the British throne]]\n*[[List of heirs to the English throne]]\n*[[List of heirs to the Scottish throne]]\n*[[List of monarchs in the British Isles]]\n*[[Posthumous birth]]\n*[[Royal Succession Act 2013]] (New Zealand)\n*[[Royal Succession Bills and Acts]]\n*[[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] (United Kingdom)\n*[[Succession to the Crown Act 2015]] (Australia)\n*[[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]] (Canada)\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Blackstone, William (1765).

Third in line is [[Prince George of Cambridge|Prince George]], the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge|Princess Charlotte]], and younger brother, [[Prince Louis of Cambridge|Prince Louis]]. Sixth in line is [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex]], the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the [[Perth Agreement]], which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.\n\nThe first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]]. Counsellors of State perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.\n\nThe United Kingdom is one of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Each of those countries has the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the realms [[Perth Agreement|agreed unanimously]] to adopt a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective [[The Crown|Crowns]] so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement, instead of [[male-preference primogeniture]], and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the [[Church of England]].

Richard was the last king of the [[House of York]], and the last of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]]. Henry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his victory over Richard at Bosworth Field,<ref>Chrimes, S. B. (1999).

Ward, Lock, Bowden & Co. p. 298.</ref>\n\nHenry VII was followed by his son, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Though his father descended from the Lancastrians, Henry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother [[Elizabeth of York|Elizabeth]] was the sister and heiress of [[Edward V of England|Edward V]]. In 1542 Henry also assumed the title [[King of Ireland]]; this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and later Great Britain, until the [[Acts of Union 1800]] merged the separate crowns into that of the United Kingdom.\n\nHenry VIII's numerous marriages led to several complications over succession. Henry VIII was first married to [[Catherine of Aragon]], by whom he had a daughter named [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. His second marriage, to [[Anne Boleyn]], resulted in a daughter named [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. Henry VIII had a son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], by his third wife, [[Jane Seymour]]. An Act of Parliament passed in 1533 declared Mary illegitimate; another passed in 1536 did the same for Elizabeth. Though the two remained illegitimate, an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 allowed reinserting them, providing further \"that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign, appoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises \u2026 by [[letters patent]] or last will in writing.\" Mary and Elizabeth, under [[Will of Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's will]], were to be followed by descendants of the King's deceased sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk]] (he, however, excluded his niece [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk]]). This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of Henry's eldest sister [[Margaret Tudor]], who were the rulers of [[Scotland]].\n[[File:Elizabeth I in Parliament.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen Elizabeth I enthroned in Parliament]]\n\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, the young Edward succeeded him, becoming Edward VI. Edward VI was the first Protestant Sovereign to succeed to the rule of England. He attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to prevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He excluded Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, [[Lady Jane Grey]]. Jane was also originally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England. Nonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane's heirs-male, was amended to refer to Jane ''and'' her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI's death in 1553, Jane was proclaimed Queen of England and Ireland. She was not universally recognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As Henry VIII's will had been approved by an Act of Parliament in 1544, Edward's contravening will was unlawful and ignored.\n\nMary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst previous monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the [[Treasons Act 1571]] asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny Parliamentary authority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further passed the Act of Association 1584, which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding. (The Act was repealed in 1863.)\n\n===Scotland===\nThe [[House of Stuart|House of Stewart]] (later Stuart) had ruled in Scotland since 1371. It had followed strict rules of primogeniture until the deposition and exile of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]] in 1567; even then she was succeeded by her son, [[James VI and I|James VI]].\n\n===After the union of the crowns===\n\n====Stuarts====\nElizabeth I of England and Ireland was succeeded by King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]], her first cousin twice removed, even though his succession violated Henry VIII's will, under which [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven|Lady Anne Stanley]], heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was supposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to statutory provision, and as King of Scotland was powerful enough to deter any rival. He reigned as James I of England and Ireland, thus effecting the [[Union of the Crowns]], although England and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His succession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_1603 \"Succession to the Crown Act 1603\"].</ref>\n\n{{wide image|House of Stuart.png|850px|Principal members of the house of Stuart following the 1603 Union of the Crowns.|center}}\nJames's eldest surviving son and successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], was overthrown and beheaded in 1649. The monarchy itself was abolished. A few years later, it was replaced by the Protectorate under [[Oliver Cromwell]], effectively a monarch with the title of [[Lord Protector]] rather than King. Cromwell had the right to name his own successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by choosing his son, [[Richard Cromwell]]. Richard was ineffective, and was quickly forced from office. Shortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I's son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King.\n\n[[File:Wissing, Willem - Queen Anne, 1687.jpg|thumb|upright|After the death of her last child in 1700, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] became the last individual left in the line of succession determined by the Bill of Rights.]]\n[[James II of England|James II and VII]], a Roman Catholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s to [[Exclusion Crisis|exclude]] him in favour of Charles's illegitimate Protestant son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]. James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee from England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the realms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King's infant son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]] but to his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and to her husband [[William III of England|William]], who as James's nephew was the first person in the succession not descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance in British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland) and Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this unique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.\n\nThe English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right|Claim of Right Act]], both passed in 1689, determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish Thrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by any future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants were allowed to succeed to the Thrones, and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\n\nAfter Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own death in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was almost at an end; William and Mary never had any children, and Princess Anne's children had all died. Therefore, Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]. The Act maintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be succeeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own descendants from future marriages. The Act, however, declared that they would be followed by James I & VI's granddaughter [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]], Electress Dowager of Hanover (the daughter of James's daughter [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]]), and her heirs. As under the Bill of Rights, non-Protestants and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\n\n[[File:Kurfuerstin_Sophie.JPG|thumb|upright|Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630\u20131714)]]\nUpon William's death, Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. Because the Parliament of England settled on Sophia as Anne's heir-presumptive without consulting Scottish leaders, the [[Estates of Scotland]] retaliated by passing the Scottish [[Act of Security]]. The Act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would meet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same person as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic conditions were met. Anne originally withheld the [[Royal Assent]], but was forced to grant it when the Estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Queen's army. England's Parliament responded by passing the [[Alien Act 1705]], which threatened to cripple Scotland's economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little choice but to unite with England to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707; the Crown of the new nation (along with the Crown of Ireland) was subject to the rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.\n\n====Hanoverians and Windsors====\n[[Image:ProtestantTutor.png|left|upright|thumb|[[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris's]] ''Protestant Tutor'', a primer popular for decades and the source for the ''[[New England Primer]]''.

With Instructions for Grounding them in the True Protestant Religion.\"]]\nAnne was predeceased by Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover, and was therefore succeeded by the latter's son, who became [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714.\n\nAttempts were made in the [[Jacobite risings|risings of 1715 and 1745]] to restore Stuart claimants to the Throne, supported by those who recognised the [[Jacobite succession]]. The [[House of Hanover]] nonetheless remained undeposed, and the Crown descended in accordance with the appointed rules. In 1801, following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the separate crowns of Great Britain and Ireland were merged and became the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Between 1811 and 1820, when [[George III]] was deemed unfit to rule, the Prince of Wales (later [[George IV]]) acted as his [[Regency era|regent]]. Some years later the [[Regency Act 1830]] made provision for a change in the line of succession had a child been born to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] after his death, but this event did not come about.\n[[File:Coronation of George VI 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|George VI receiving [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] at his [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation]] in 1937]]\n\nOn the death of William IV in 1837, his 18-year-old niece [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] succeeded to the throne. After a 63-year reign, often known as the [[Victorian era]], she was succeeded in 1901 by her eldest son [[Edward VII]]. On his death, his second son acceded to the throne as [[George V]] (Edward's first son [[Prince Albert Victor]] died during an [[influenza pandemic]] in 1892).\n\n[[Edward VIII]] was proclaimed King on the death of his father, George V, in January 1936,<ref>{{cite news | publisher=UPI |location= London |date= 21 January 1936 |url =http://www.upi.com/Archives/1936/01/21/Prince-of-Wales-proclaimed-King-Edward-VIII/7807693511214/ | title = Prince of Wales proclaimed King Edward VIII }}</ref>  Edward [[State Opening of Parliament|opened Parliament]] in November, but abdicated in December 1936, and was never [[Abandoned coronation of Edward VIII|crowned]]. Edward had desired to marry [[Wallis Simpson]], a divorcee, but the [[Church of England]], of which the British Sovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorize the marriage of divorcees. Consequently, Parliament passed [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]], by which Edward VIII ceased to be Sovereign \"immediately upon\" his royal assent as King being signified in Parliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if any, were not to have any \"right, title or interest in or to the succession to the Throne\". Edward died childless in 1972.\n\nEdward's abdication was \"a [[demise of the Crown]]\" (in the words of the Act), and the [[Duke of York#Seventh creation, 1920\u20131936|Duke of York]], his brother who was then next in the line, immediately succeeded to the throne and to its \"rights, privileges, and dignities\", taking the [[regnal name]] George VI. He in turn was succeeded in 1952 by his own elder daughter, Elizabeth II. By that time the monarch of the United Kingdom no longer reigned in the greater part of Ireland (which had become a [[Republic of Ireland|republic]] in 1949), but was the monarch of a number of independent sovereign states (Commonwealth realms).\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\n{{Further|Perth Agreement}}\n[[File:Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II Couronnement de la Reine Elizabeth II.jpg|thumb|upright|Elizabeth II at her coronation in 1953, passing to the left of the [[Coronation Chair]]]]\n\nBy the terms of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], each of the Commonwealth realms has the same person as monarch and, to maintain that arrangement, they have agreed to continue the same line of succession; some realms do so through domestic succession laws, while others stipulate whoever is monarch of the United Kingdom will also be monarch of that realm. In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|was proclaimed]] as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In October 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|meeting]] held in Perth, Australia, to proposed changes to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession for people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute primogeniture\u2014wherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of sex\u2014instead of male-preference primogeniture. They also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics. The ban on Catholics themselves was retained to ensure that the monarch would be in communion with the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607 |title=Girls equal in British throne succession |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 2011}}</ref> The changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, after legislation was made according to each realm's constitution.<ref name=\"Commencement Order\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/894/made The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 (Commencement) Order 2015] legislation.gov.uk</ref><ref name=\"Clegg Commencement\">Clegg, Nick (26 March 2015).

Royal Central. 26 March 2015.{{unreliable source?|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Current rules==\nThe Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union) still govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom by the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], which was passed mainly \"to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender\" and \"to make provision about Royal Marriages\" (according to its [[long title]]), thereby implementing the [[Perth Agreement]] in the UK and in those realms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is monarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.\n\nAnyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were dead. That person's descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally ineligible.\n\n===Marriages===\nThe [[Act of Settlement 1701]] provides that Protestant \"[[heirs of the body]]\" (that is, legitimate descendants) of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise disqualified. The meaning of ''heir of the body'' is determined by the common law rules of male preference [[primogeniture]] (the \"male-preference\" criterion is no longer applicable, in respect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011), whereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children, and a male child takes precedence over a female sibling.<ref>Blackstone (1765).</ref> Children born out of wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate children whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain ineligible to inherit the Crown.<ref group=n>Neither the [[Legitimacy Act 1926]] nor the [[Legitimacy Act 1959]] changed the Law of Succession.</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required descendants of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The requirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into foreign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII,<ref group=n>Per the [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]].</ref> of whom there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]] older than twenty-five years notified the Privy Council of his or her intention to marry without the consent of the Sovereign, then he or she may have lawfully done so after one year, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage. A marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the resulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the succession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected. This also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without permission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding on account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] attempted to marry the Roman Catholic [[Maria Anne Fitzherbert|Maria Fitzherbert]] in 1785 without obtaining permission from [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due course.<ref name=\"bogdanor_55\"/> A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void \"for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown\" under the 2013 act.<ref name=\"Act 2013\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/section/3 \"Succession to the Crown Act 2013\"].

Section 3.</ref>\n\nThe constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII's decision to marry a divorcee in 1936 led to [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]], which provided that Edward VIII and his descendants would have no claim to the throne.<ref>His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, section 2</ref> The Act is no longer applicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.\n\nUnder the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the first six persons in line to the throne must obtain the sovereign's approval before marrying.<ref name=\"Act 2013\"/> Marriage without the Sovereign's consent disqualifies the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown,<ref name=\"Act 2013\"/> but the marriage is still legally valid.\n\n===Religion===\nRules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained under the Act of Settlement. The preamble to the Act of Settlement notes that the Bill of Rights provides \"that all and every person and persons that then [at the time of the Bill of Right's passage] were, or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with the [[Holy See|See or Church of Rome]], or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded.\"<ref>Act of Settlement, preamble</ref> The Act of Settlement continues, providing \"that all and every Person and Persons who shall \u2026 is, are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome or shall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a papist shall be subject to such Incapacities\"<ref>Act of Settlement, section 2</ref> as the Bill of Rights established. The clause precludes a Roman Catholic from succeeding to the throne.\n\nUnder the Act of Settlement the monarch is required to be in communion with the [[Church of England]],<ref name=BM/> so it is not only Catholics who are barred from the throne.\n\nThe Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman Catholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be Anglican; it only barred those who marry Roman Catholics. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the ban on individuals who marry Roman Catholics, though not on Roman Catholics themselves, because the monarch is Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\n===Treason===\nUnder the [[Treason Act 1702]] and the Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] to \"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding ... to the imperial crown of this realm\". Since the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], the maximum penalty has been life imprisonment.\n\n==Accession==\n[[File:St Jamess Palace.jpg|thumb|upright|The Accession Council normally meets in [[St James's Palace]] to proclaim the new sovereign.]]\nIn the Commonwealth realms, upon the death of a sovereign, the heir apparent or heir presumptive succeeds to the throne immediately, with no need for confirmation or further ceremony.<ref>[https://www.royal.uk/accession \"Accession\"].

Retrieved 7 May 2016.</ref>{{#tag:ref|A letter from [[Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree|Tony Newton]] as [[Lord President of the Council]] to [[Tony Benn]] indicated this was the effect of the Act of Settlement after Benn had indicated he intended to block the next accession at the Privy Council.<ref>Bogdanor (1995), p. 45.</ref>|group=n}} Nevertheless, the [[Accession Council]] meets and decides upon the making of the accession proclamation, which by custom has for centuries been ceremonially proclaimed in public places, in London, [[York]], [[Edinburgh]] and other cities. The anniversary is observed throughout the sovereign's reign as [[Accession Day]], including royal [[gun salutes]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>[https://www.royal.uk/gun-salutes \"Gun Salutes\"]. Official website of the British Monarchy. Retrieved 7 May 2016.</ref>\n\nFormerly, a new sovereign proclaimed his or her own accession. But on the death of Elizabeth I an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of James I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as King James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the Accession Council normally meets in [[St James's Palace]]. Proclamations since James I's have usually been made in the name of the [[Lords Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]], the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]], [[Alderman|Aldermen]] and citizens of the [[City of London]] and \"other principal [[Gentleman|Gentlemen]] of quality\", though there have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nUpon his or her accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism.{{refn|group=\"n\"|This declaration was similar to what members of both Houses of Parliament were originally required to take by the Test Acts. Eventually, by the time it was changed in 1910, the monarch was the only one left required to make the declaration.}} This declaration, known as the [[Accession Declaration]], is required to be taken either at the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign (i.e. during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]) or at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of this declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be controversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and that he or she will \"uphold and maintain\" the Protestant succession.<ref>Accession Declaration Act 1910, schedule</ref> In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to \"maintain and preserve\" the Church of Scotland.<ref>Union with Scotland Act 1706, article XXV. \"...And Lastly that after the Decease of Her Present Majesty (whom God long preserve) the Soveraign succeeding to her in the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Great Britain shall in all time comeing at his or her accession to the Crown Swear and Subscribe That they shall inviolably maintain and preserve the foresaid settlement of the True Protestant Religion with the Government Worship Discipline Right and Priviledges of this Church as above established by the Laws of this Kingdom in prosecution of the Claim of Right...\"</ref> This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of the Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the [[Regency Act 1937]], should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon attainment of that age.<ref>Regency Act 1937, section 1(2)</ref>\n\nAfter a period of mourning,<ref name=\"royal.gov-coronation\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/coronation |title=Coronation |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref> the new sovereign is usually [[coronation of the British monarch|consecrated and crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Normally, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] officiates, though the sovereign may designate any other bishop of the [[Church of England]]. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, [[Edward VIII]] was [[Abandoned coronation of Edward VIII|never crowned]], yet during his short reign was the undoubted king.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Royalty|United Kingdom}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Accession Declaration Act 1910]]\n*[[Alternative successions of the English crown]]\n*[[British prince]]\n*[[British princess]]\n*[[Family tree of the British royal family]]\n*[[Jacobite succession]]\n*[[List of British monarchs]]\n*[[List of descendants of George V]]\n*[[List of heirs to the British throne]]\n*[[List of heirs to the English throne]]\n*[[List of heirs to the Scottish throne]]\n*[[List of monarchs in the British Isles]]\n*[[Posthumous birth]]\n*[[Royal Succession Act 2013]] (New Zealand)\n*[[Royal Succession Bills and Acts]]\n*[[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] (United Kingdom)\n*[[Succession to the Crown Act 2015]] (Australia)\n*[[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]] (Canada)\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Blackstone, William (1765).

Set in [[Hell]], themed as a [[college town]], the player navigates dialog-based conversations, outdrink Satan, and return two best friends from the afterlife.\n\n== Plot ==\nLifelong friends and recent college graduates Sang Bong or as he prefers Milo, and Lola Woolfe find themselves in Hell, with no recollection of how they came to be there. After being assigned a Personal Demon, Sister Mary Wormhorn, they meet Sam, a [[psychopomp]] cab driver. Sam explains that while demons torture humans, after work hours, both groups enjoy the nights drinking and partying. Sam explains that the only way out of Hell is to outdrink and out-party Satan himself in a contest. Needing an invite to Satan's party at his home, Milo and Lola traverse Hell. Milo and Lola eventually meet Lucifer, who demands they prove their abilities before challenging him by obtaining seals of approval from his brothers and sisters, the Monarchs of Hell.\n\nOne of the Monarchs is Apollyon, a judge of the Dead. Milo and Lola sneak into a demons-only bar to find Apollyon, who sees through their disguise and agrees to give them a seal if they serve as lawyers for Roberto, a soul charged with serial murder. Milo and Lola can either throw the trial per Apollyon's wishes or else let Roberto ascend to heaven and challenge Apollyon afterward; either way, Apollyon will give the pair her seal.\n\nAnother Monarch is the hard-partying Asmodeus, who is trying to forget about his recent breakup with his ex, Beth. Milo and Lola can either get Asmodeus and Beth back together or otherwise beat Asmodeus in a dance-off, to obtain the necessary seal.\n\nHaving obtained the needed seals, Milo and Lola return to Satan's party, with a team of challengers drawn from the people they have met during the night. Apollyon attempts an intervention, feeling that Satan's drinking is out of control and Hell is suffering because of it, but Satan angrily continues the drinking game with Milo and Lola, teleporting them away from the party.\n\nThe game has multiple endings, depending on Milo and Lola's performance. If they win the contest, they are sent back to Earth and resume their lives. If they lose the contest or refuse to play, they remain in Hell; while Satan still struggles with his addiction, Hell appears to be running better. After mentioning that Hell is actually better than they thought, Sam bursts in, having found another loophole to possibly allow them to escape Hell, to which Milo and Lola immediately agree to.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 75/100<ref name=Metacritic>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/afterparty/critic-reviews |title=Afterparty Critic Reviews for PC |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2019-11-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| EuroG = Recommended<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hetfeld |first1=Malindy |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-28-afterparty-review-a-candid-reflection-on-the-fear-of-growing-up |title=Afterparty review - a candid reflection on the fear of growing up |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2019-10-28 |accessdate=2019-11-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 7/10<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Vazquez |first1=Suriel |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/afterparty-review-drink-die-repeat/1900-6417349/ |title=Afterparty Review - Drink, Die, Repeat |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=2019-11-04 |accessdate=2019-11-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GRadar = 3.5/5<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Delaney |first1=Mark |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/afterparty-review/ |title=Afterparty review: 'Hilarious and blasphemous' |work=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=2019-10-28 |accessdate=2019-11-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.5/10<ref name=IGNRev>{{Cite web |last1=Dornbush |first1=Jonathon |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/28/afterparty-review |title=Afterparty Review |work=[[IGN]] |date=2019-10-28 |accessdate=2019-11-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| PCGUK = 80%<ref name=PCGUK>{{Cite web |last1=Agnew |first1=Callum |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/afterparty-review/ |title=Afterparty review |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=2019-10-28 |accessdate=2019-11-03 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| USG = 4/5<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Cryer |first1=Hirun |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/afterparty-review-hell-of-a-good-time |title=Afterparty Review: Hell of a Good Time |work=[[USgamer]] |date=2019-10-28 |accessdate=2019-11-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game received \"generally favourable reviews\" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=Metacritic/>\n\n''[[PC Gamer]]'' said, \"I had high expectations for ''Afterparty''.

On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her seatbelt to lean over and kiss Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over, talks about how \"moments of impact help in finding who we are\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and share a kiss under the [[Cloud Gate]] are interwoven with the present.\n\nWhen Paige regains consciousness, she thinks Leo is her doctor, having lost all memories of the past few years. When her wealthy parents, Bill and Rita Thornton, learn about this, they visit her. This is the first time that Leo meets them, and they do not appreciate Leo taking their daughter, and not being informed. Paige does not understand why he would not have met her parents, after having been married to her. She finds it even stranger that he did not know why either. Nor did she understand why she left law school, broke her engagement with her previous [[Engagement|fianc\u00e9]], Jeremy, and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory. Paige is welcomed home with a surprise party by her friends, but as she is not able to remember any of them, she finds it overwhelming and is extremely confused.\n\nThe next day Paige ventures out to her regular [[Coffeehouse|caf\u00e9]], but does not remember having been there and loses her way back. She calls her mother because she does not know or remember Leo's number. That evening Leo and Paige are invited for dinner by her parents. At the dinner and in the bar later, Leo does not fit in with her family and friends. He persists in his attempts to help her regain her lost memory, but Paige is more driven to learn why she left law school and broke her engagement to Jeremy. During the course of one encounter with Jeremy, she kisses him. Her doctor advises her to fill the holes in her memory rather than be afraid of her past. With her sister Gwen's wedding approaching, Paige decides to stay with her parents until the wedding. Though Leo asks her out on a date and spends a night with her, the relationship is further strained when Paige's dad attempts to persuade Leo to divorce his daughter, and by Leo punching Jeremy for talking about chances to bed his wife.\n\nPaige rejoins law school and Leo signs divorce papers. At a store, she meets her old friend Diane who, unaware of her amnesia, apologizes for having had a relationship with Paige's dad, thus alerting Paige as to why she had left her family. When she confronts her mother about this, Rita tells her that she decided to stay with Bill for all the things he had done right instead of leaving him for one wrong act. Paige then asks Leo why he never told her, and he replies he wanted to earn her love instead of driving her away from her parents. Paige, while in class, starts sketching; thus depicting why she first left law school. She continues her interest in art, eventually returning to sculpting and drawing. Though Jeremy confesses he broke up with his present girlfriend, hoping to be back with her, she turns him down stating she needs to know what life would be like without him.\n\nAs seasons change, Leo discusses his philosophy about \"Moments of impact\". \"A moment of impact whose potential for change has ripple effects far beyond what we can predict. Sending some particles crashing together, making them closer than before. While sending others, spinning off into great adventures, landing where you never thought you'd find them\". Back in her room, Paige finds the menu card on which she had written her wedding vows and is deeply moved. The movie ends with Paige finding Leo at their regular Caf\u00e9 Mnemonic and going with him to try a new place instead of their old haunts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Paige Collins\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Leo Collins\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Rita Thornton, Paige's mother<ref name=\"Hollywood\" />\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Bill Thornton, Paige's father<ref name=\"Hollywood\">[http://www.hollywoodtrailers.net/2010/10/jessica-lange-and-sam-neill-join-the-vow \"Jessica Lange and Sam Neill Join The Vow\"].

On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her seatbelt to lean over and kiss Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over, talks about how \"moments of impact help in finding who we are\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and share a kiss under the [[Cloud Gate]] are interwoven with the present.\n\nWhen Paige regains consciousness, she thinks Leo is her doctor, having lost all memories of the past few years. When her wealthy parents, Bill and Rita Thornton, learn about this, they visit her. This is the first time that Leo meets them, and they do not appreciate Leo taking their daughter, and not being informed. Paige does not understand why he would not have met her parents, after having been married to her. She finds it even stranger that he did not know why either. Nor did she understand why she left law school, broke her engagement with her previous [[Engagement|fianc\u00e9]], Jeremy, and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory. Paige is welcomed home with a surprise party by her friends, but as she is not able to remember any of them, she finds it overwhelming and is extremely confused.\n\nThe next day Paige ventures out to her regular [[Coffeehouse|caf\u00e9]], but does not remember having been there and loses her way back. She calls her mother because she does not know or remember Leo's number. That evening Leo and Paige are invited for dinner by her parents. At the dinner and in the bar later, Leo does not fit in with her family and friends. He persists in his attempts to help her regain her lost memory, but Paige is more driven to learn why she left law school and broke her engagement to Jeremy. During the course of one encounter with Jeremy, she kisses him. Her doctor advises her to fill the holes in her memory rather than be afraid of her past. With her sister Gwen's wedding approaching, Paige decides to stay with her parents until the wedding. Though Leo asks her out on a date and spends a night with her, the relationship is further strained when Paige's dad attempts to persuade Leo to divorce his daughter, and by Leo punching Jeremy for talking about chances to bed his wife.\n\nPaige rejoins law school and Leo signs divorce papers. At a store, she meets her old friend Diane who, unaware of her amnesia, apologizes for having had a relationship with Paige's dad, thus alerting Paige as to why she had left her family. When she confronts her mother about this, Rita tells her that she decided to stay with Bill for all the things he had done right instead of leaving him for one wrong act. Paige then asks Leo why he never told her, and he replies he wanted to earn her love instead of driving her away from her parents. Paige, while in class, starts sketching; thus depicting why she first left law school. She continues her interest in art, eventually returning to sculpting and drawing. Though Jeremy confesses he broke up with his present girlfriend, hoping to be back with her, she turns him down stating she needs to know what life would be like without him.\n\nAs seasons change, Leo discusses his philosophy about \"Moments of impact\". \"A moment of impact whose potential for change has ripple effects far beyond what we can predict. Sending some particles crashing together, making them closer than before. While sending others, spinning off into great adventures, landing where you never thought you'd find them\". Back in her room, Paige finds the menu card on which she had written her wedding vows and is deeply moved. The movie ends with Paige finding Leo at their regular Caf\u00e9 Mnemonic and going with him to try a new place instead of their old haunts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Paige Collins\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Leo Collins\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Rita Thornton, Paige's mother<ref name=\"Hollywood\" />\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Bill Thornton, Paige's father<ref name=\"Hollywood\">[http://www.hollywoodtrailers.net/2010/10/jessica-lange-and-sam-neill-join-the-vow \"Jessica Lange and Sam Neill Join The Vow\"].
