According to the theory, ToM is implicit in [[neurotypical]] individuals. This enables one to make automatic interpretations of events taking into consideration the mental states of people, their desires and beliefs. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] described how an individual lacking a ToM would perceive the world in a confusing and frightening manner, leading to a withdrawal from society.<ref name=cohen1>{{cite journal |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Autism: a specific cognitive disorder of 'mind-blindness |journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] |year=1990 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=81\u201390 |doi=10.3109/09540269009028274}}</ref> Since Cohen\u2019s opinion was based on the idea that biology is strictly linked to autistic behavior, he started wondering if a delayed development of the theory of mind would lead to additional psychiatric complications.

Based on empirical evidence, [[Uta Frith]] concluded that the processing of complex cognitive emotions is impaired compared to simpler emotions. In addition, attachment does not seem to fail in the early childhood of autistics. This suggests that emotion is a component of social cognition that is separable from [[mentalization|mentalizing]].<ref name=cory />\n\nLombardo and Cohen updated the theory and pinpointed some additional factors that play an important part in ToM of autistic people. They highlighted that the middle [[cingulate cortex]] which is outside the traditional mentalizing region was underactive in autistic patients, while the rest of ToM activation was normal.

Indeed, scholar  Wang, in her work ''Mindful learning: Children\u2019s developing theory of mind and their understanding of the concept of learning'' argues that the \u201ctheory of mind development is critical for children to engage in ''mindful learning'', which refers to the learning during which the learner is consciously aware of own mental states and the changes in them, both motivational and epistemic mental states\u201d. <ref>{{Citation|last=Okamoto|first=Yukari|title=Children\u2019s Developing Understanding of Number: Mind, Brain, and Culture|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3666-7_6|work=The Developmental Relations among Mind, Brain and Education|pages=129\u2013148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-90-481-3665-0|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Wang was able to demonstrate that children develop theory of mind as they understand how to conceptualize learning. <ref>{{Citation|last=Okamoto|first=Yukari|title=Children\u2019s Developing Understanding of Number: Mind, Brain, and Culture|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3666-7_6|work=The Developmental Relations among Mind, Brain and Education|pages=129\u2013148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-90-481-3665-0|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Indeed, Wang argued, during preschool years children become able to consider learning as the \u201crepresentational knowledge change in the mind\u201d.<ref>{{Citation|last=Okamoto|first=Yukari|title=Children\u2019s Developing Understanding of Number: Mind, Brain, and Culture|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3666-7_6|work=The Developmental Relations among Mind, Brain and Education|pages=129\u2013148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-90-481-3665-0|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\nAdditionally, Wang was also able to demonstrate that children that belong to divergent cultures develop theory of mind in different ways. Al-Hilawani, Easterbrooks, and Marchant (2002), who tried to understand the phenomenon regarding the development of the theory of mind in children from different cultures, reported that children with hearing loss, and therefore children who could potentially have problems developing the theory of mind, are \u201csimilar to hearing children in their ability to learn and reason if they are from the same culture, but not necessarily if the two groups of students are from different cultures\u201d. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Al-Hilawani|first=Yasser A.|last2=Easterbrooks|first2=Susan R.|last3=Marchant|first3=Gregory J.|date=2002|title=Metacognitive Ability From a Theory-of-Mind Perspective: A Cross-Cultural Study of Students With and Without Hearing Loss|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/aad.2012.0230|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|volume=147|issue=4|pages=38\u201347|doi=10.1353/aad.2012.0230|issn=1543-0375}}</ref>\n<br />\n=== Biological basis ===\nNeural correlates of the ToM point towards three regions of the brains. The anterior paracingulate cortex (Brodmann), is considered at the key region of mentalizing. It is located anterior corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate cortex. This cortex is associated with the medial frontal cortex where activation is associated with the mentalization of states. The cells of the ACC develops at the age of 4 months suggesting that the manifestations of mind-blindness may occur around this time.<ref name=perry>{{cite journal | last=Gallagher | first=Helen L. | author2=Frith, Christopher D. | title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' | journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | date=1 February 2003 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=77\u201383 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 | pmid=12584026| url=http://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/grad_cog/evo_of_cognition/articles/Gallagh_TICS_ToM.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anterior paracingulate cortex, there is the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles that are involved with the ToM and its nature. However, these areas are not uniquely associated with mentalization. They aid in the activation of the regions that are associated with the ToM. The superior temporal sulcus is therefore involved in the processing of behavioural information, while the temporal poles are involved in the retrieval of personal experiences. These are considered important regions for the activation of the ToM regions and are associated with the mind-blindness. The temporal poles provide personal experiences for mentalization such as facial recognition, emotional memory and familiar voices. In patients suffering from semantic dementia, for example, the temporal regions of these patients undergo atrophy and lead to certain deficits which can cause mind-blindness.<ref name=perry />\n\n[[File:250px-Gray726-STS.png|thumb|right|Superior temporal sulcus]]\nThe amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex also are a part of the ToM.  Those mental structures seem to be involved in the interpretation of behavior. It is suspected, in fact, that the damage to the orbitofrontal cortex brings upon subtle impairments, but not a total loss of the ToM that would lead to mind-blindness.<ref name=perry /> Some studies{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with the theory of the mind or mind-blindness.

The under activation of this network may inhibit the interactive influences between regions that process higher and lower perceptual items.<ref name=cory />\n\n=== Relationship to autism ===\nIndividuals with autism tend to experience episodes of mind blindness. \n\nAccording to the psychologist Uta Frith, individuals with social and communication impairments, such as who is affected by autism, will experience difficulties in the process of attributing mental states, as desires and beliefs, to themselves or to others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frith|first=Uta|date=2001-12|title=Mind Blindness and the Brain in Autism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00552-9|journal=Neuron|volume=32|issue=6|pages=969\u2013979|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00552-9|issn=0896-6273}}</ref> In her article Mind Blindness and Brain in Autism, Frith discusses the differences between mind reading and mind blindness, and how those phenomena are experienced in the mind of a person with autism. Additionally, Frith affirms that individuals that are affected by autism, have \u201coccasionally commented on what they perceive as an unfathomable yet ubiquitous ability of other people to \u201cmind read\u201d during ordinary social interactions. Normal people indeed behave as if they have an implicit theory of mind, and this allows them to explain and predict others\u2019 behavior in terms of their presumed thoughts and feelings\u201d. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frith|first=Uta|date=2001-12|title=Mind Blindness and the Brain in Autism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00552-9|journal=Neuron|volume=32|issue=6|pages=969\u2013979|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00552-9|issn=0896-6273}}</ref>\n\nTo contrast this idea, Carruthers, in his book Theories of Mind, explains that people affected by autism have more issues than just those argued by the theory of mind, and that those issues do not exclusively involve predicting other individuals\u2019 behavior. Carruthers seems to argue that the \u201cmind-blindness theory has only appeared to be losing out [\u2026] , because its proponents have paid insufficient attention to the consequences of their view for the access [\u2026] \u00a0that autistic people will have to their own mental states.\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|date=1996-02-23|editor-last=Carruthers|editor-first=Peter|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Peter K.|title=Theories of Theories of Mind|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511597985|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511597985}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, it is important to say that it has been discovered that lower performance on the mentalization tasks were the first screening task used to diagnose the autism, with a good prediction level.<ref name=\"cory\" />\n\nCohen proposed the mind-blindness theory of autism as \"deficits in the normal process of empathising\". He described empathising to include the ToM, mind reading and taking an intentional stance. According to this view, empathising includes the ability to attribute mental states and to react in an appropriate emotional manner that is appropriate to another's mental state. More deficits tend to occur in reference to one's own mental states compared to the other's mental states. It has been proposed that individuals affected by autism undergo a specific developmental delay in the area of metarepresentational development. Such delay has been demonstrate to facilitate mind-blindness.<ref name=\"cohen2\">{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen |first=S. | title=The cognitive neuroscience of autism | journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]] | date=1 July 2004 | volume=75 | issue=7 | pages=945\u2013948 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.018713|pmid=15201345 | pmc=1739089 }}</ref>\n\nThere is some evidence that suggests that certain patients develop a rudimentary ToM and do not suffer from complete lack of ToM causing mind-blindness.<ref name=\"cohen2\" /> A study by Bowler concluded that mind-blindness and social impairment is not as straightforward as previously thought.

Abnormal behaviour of autistic children is therefore perceived to include a lack of reciprocity. Some cases in which mind-blindness is manifested, could include the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as the child's incapacity to make eye contact, while he or she may instead attempt to interact with other people. However, global asocial behaviour is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in individuals diagnosed with autism as a \"triad of deficits.\" The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' minds.<ref name=\"cohen2\" />\n\nOzonoff and colleagues were able to discriminate between individuals diagnosed with the [[Asperger's syndrome]] and other individuals affected with autism by their ability to solve ToM tasks. This was possible because those diagnosed with AS seem more neurotypical in early childhood development. The siblings of individuals diagnosed with AS were shown to have a lesser variant of ToM deficits. This shows that the cognitive deficits affecting ToM play a central role in the phenotype expressed in AS diagnoses.<ref name=\"ozonoff\">{{cite journal | last=Ozonoff | first=S | author2=Rogers, S. & Pennington, B. | title=Asperger's syndrome: Evidence for an empirical distinction from high-functioning autism | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | date=November 1991 |volume=32 | issue=7 | pages=1107\u20131122 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1991.tb00352.x| pmid=1787139 }}</ref> However, since today\u2019s perceptive about autism and Asperger disorder has changed, Ozonoff research might no longer be considered among other scholars.

Some studies conducted at this regard, have been administrated by Cleghorn and Albert (1990), who strived to understand schizophrenia from multiple angles, such as neurobiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive science. They found that despite \u201cindividual modules of cognitive and emotional function may be intact in schizophrenia, messages are inappropriately sent to parts of the brain not specialized for the required information [\u2026]thus, \u201cmodular disjunction\u201d of widely distributed neural systems develops, causing the signs and symptoms of schizophrenic psychosis.\u201d <ref>{{Citation|last=Cleghorn|first=John M.|title=Modular Disjunction in Schizophrenia: A Framework for a Pathological Psychophysiology|date=1990|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-3248-3_3|work=International Perspectives Series: Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience|pages=59\u201380|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=978-0-387-97221-3|access-date=2020-04-05|last2=Albert|first2=Martin L.}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Frith has predicted that the extent of mind-blindness depends on whether the objective/behavioural or subjective symptoms of ToM abilities prevail.<ref name=\"cory\" /> Patients with the behavioural symptoms perform the poorest in ToM tasks, similar to autistic subjects, while patients displaying subjective/experiential symptoms have a ToM. However, these patients are impaired in using contextual information to infer what these mental states are.<ref name=\"brune\" />\n\nAdditionally, it is important to affirm that some scholars have decided to look deeper at Frith\u2019s work and review/ critique her theory. In fact, in their work ''Theory of mind in schizophrenia: A critical review'', Professors Harrington, Siegert, and McClure (2005), have affirmed that the theory proposed by Uta Frith has not few issues that need to be redirected.

However one of the most important limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait attributed to autistic people. This triad is explained through the process of systemising.<ref name=cohen2 /> The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism.<ref name=cory /> These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autistic people, fails to explain such patients' penchants for narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis.  Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to autistic people, since conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] to various [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s and/or [[anti-social personality disorder]]s all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.<ref name=\"cohen\" />\n\nAnother issue associated with the mind-blindness theory is that researchers are unable to predict whether the social deficits are a primary or secondary result of mind-blindness.

According to the theory, ToM is implicit in [[neurotypical]] individuals. This enables one to make automatic interpretations of events taking into consideration the mental states of people, their desires and beliefs. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] described how an individual lacking a ToM would perceive the world in a confusing and frightening manner, leading to a withdrawal from society.<ref name=cohen1>{{cite journal |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Autism: a specific cognitive disorder of 'mind-blindness |journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] |year=1990 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=81\u201390 |doi=10.3109/09540269009028274}}</ref> Since Cohen\u2019s opinion was based on the idea that biology is strictly linked to autistic behavior, he started wondering if a delayed development of the theory of mind would lead to additional psychiatric complications.

Based on empirical evidence, [[Uta Frith]] concluded that the processing of complex cognitive emotions is impaired compared to simpler emotions. In addition, attachment does not seem to fail in the early childhood of autistics. This suggests that emotion is a component of social cognition that is separable from [[mentalization|mentalizing]].<ref name=cory />\n\nLombardo and Cohen updated the theory and pinpointed some additional factors that play an important part in ToM of autistic people. They highlighted that the middle [[cingulate cortex]] which is outside the traditional mentalizing region was underactive in autistic patients, while the rest of ToM activation was normal. This region was important in deciding how much to invest in a person and hence required mentalization.<ref name=lamcohen>{{cite journal |last=Lombardo |first=Michael V. |author2=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=The role of the self in mindblindness in autism |journal=[[Consciousness and Cognition]] |date=1 March 2011 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=130\u2013140 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.006 |pmid=20932779}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Theory of Mind in children''' ===\nScholars have recently wondered if children do possess a theory of mind.

Indeed, scholar  Wang, in her work ''Mindful learning: Children\u2019s developing theory of mind and their understanding of the concept of learning'' argues that the \u201ctheory of mind development is critical for children to engage in ''mindful learning'', which refers to the learning during which the learner is consciously aware of own mental states and the changes in them, both motivational and epistemic mental states\u201d. <ref>{{Citation|last=Okamoto|first=Yukari|title=Children\u2019s Developing Understanding of Number: Mind, Brain, and Culture|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3666-7_6|work=The Developmental Relations among Mind, Brain and Education|pages=129\u2013148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-90-481-3665-0|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Wang was able to demonstrate that children develop theory of mind as they understand how to conceptualize learning. <ref>{{Citation|last=Okamoto|first=Yukari|title=Children\u2019s Developing Understanding of Number: Mind, Brain, and Culture|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3666-7_6|work=The Developmental Relations among Mind, Brain and Education|pages=129\u2013148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-90-481-3665-0|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Indeed, Wang argued, during preschool years children become able to consider learning as the \u201crepresentational knowledge change in the mind\u201d.<ref>{{Citation|last=Okamoto|first=Yukari|title=Children\u2019s Developing Understanding of Number: Mind, Brain, and Culture|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3666-7_6|work=The Developmental Relations among Mind, Brain and Education|pages=129\u2013148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-90-481-3665-0|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\nAdditionally, Wang was also able to demonstrate that children that belong to divergent cultures develop theory of mind in different ways. Al-Hilawani, Easterbrooks, and Marchant (2002), who tried to understand the phenomenon regarding the development of the theory of mind in children from different cultures, reported that children with hearing loss, and therefore children who could potentially have problems developing the theory of mind, are \u201csimilar to hearing children in their ability to learn and reason if they are from the same culture, but not necessarily if the two groups of students are from different cultures\u201d. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Al-Hilawani|first=Yasser A.|last2=Easterbrooks|first2=Susan R.|last3=Marchant|first3=Gregory J.|date=2002|title=Metacognitive Ability From a Theory-of-Mind Perspective: A Cross-Cultural Study of Students With and Without Hearing Loss|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/aad.2012.0230|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|volume=147|issue=4|pages=38\u201347|doi=10.1353/aad.2012.0230|issn=1543-0375}}</ref>\n<br />\n=== Biological basis ===\nNeural correlates of the ToM point towards three regions of the brains. The anterior paracingulate cortex (Brodmann), is considered at the key region of mentalizing. It is located anterior corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate cortex. This cortex is associated with the medial frontal cortex where activation is associated with the mentalization of states. The cells of the ACC develops at the age of 4 months suggesting that the manifestations of mind-blindness may occur around this time.<ref name=perry>{{cite journal | last=Gallagher | first=Helen L. | author2=Frith, Christopher D. | title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' | journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | date=1 February 2003 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=77\u201383 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 | pmid=12584026| url=http://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/grad_cog/evo_of_cognition/articles/Gallagh_TICS_ToM.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anterior paracingulate cortex, there is the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles that are involved with the ToM and its nature. However, these areas are not uniquely associated with mentalization. They aid in the activation of the regions that are associated with the ToM. The superior temporal sulcus is therefore involved in the processing of behavioural information, while the temporal poles are involved in the retrieval of personal experiences. These are considered important regions for the activation of the ToM regions and are associated with the mind-blindness. The temporal poles provide personal experiences for mentalization such as facial recognition, emotional memory and familiar voices. In patients suffering from semantic dementia, for example, the temporal regions of these patients undergo atrophy and lead to certain deficits which can cause mind-blindness.<ref name=perry />\n\n[[File:250px-Gray726-STS.png|thumb|right|Superior temporal sulcus]]\nThe amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex also are a part of the ToM.  Those mental structures seem to be involved in the interpretation of behavior. It is suspected, in fact, that the damage to the orbitofrontal cortex brings upon subtle impairments, but not a total loss of the ToM that would lead to mind-blindness.<ref name=perry /> Some studies{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with the theory of the mind or mind-blindness.

Additionally, Frith affirms that individuals that are affected by autism, have \u201coccasionally commented on what they perceive as an unfathomable yet ubiquitous ability of other people to \u201cmind read\u201d during ordinary social interactions. Normal people indeed behave as if they have an implicit theory of mind, and this allows them to explain and predict others\u2019 behavior in terms of their presumed thoughts and feelings\u201d. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frith|first=Uta|date=2001-12|title=Mind Blindness and the Brain in Autism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00552-9|journal=Neuron|volume=32|issue=6|pages=969\u2013979|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00552-9|issn=0896-6273}}</ref>\n\nTo contrast this idea, Carruthers, in his book Theories of Mind, explains that people affected by autism have more issues than just those argued by the theory of mind, and that those issues do not exclusively involve predicting other individuals\u2019 behavior. Carruthers seems to argue that the \u201cmind-blindness theory has only appeared to be losing out [\u2026] , because its proponents have paid insufficient attention to the consequences of their view for the access [\u2026] \u00a0that autistic people will have to their own mental states.\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|date=1996-02-23|editor-last=Carruthers|editor-first=Peter|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Peter K.|title=Theories of Theories of Mind|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511597985|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511597985}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, it is important to say that it has been discovered that lower performance on the mentalization tasks were the first screening task used to diagnose the autism, with a good prediction level.<ref name=\"cory\" />\n\nCohen proposed the mind-blindness theory of autism as \"deficits in the normal process of empathising\". He described empathising to include the ToM, mind reading and taking an intentional stance. According to this view, empathising includes the ability to attribute mental states and to react in an appropriate emotional manner that is appropriate to another's mental state. More deficits tend to occur in reference to one's own mental states compared to the other's mental states.

Abnormal behaviour of autistic children is therefore perceived to include a lack of reciprocity. Some cases in which mind-blindness is manifested, could include the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as the child's incapacity to make eye contact, while he or she may instead attempt to interact with other people. However, global asocial behaviour is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in individuals diagnosed with autism as a \"triad of deficits.\" The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' minds.<ref name=\"cohen2\" />\n\nOzonoff and colleagues were able to discriminate between individuals diagnosed with the [[Asperger's syndrome]] and other individuals affected with autism by their ability to solve ToM tasks. This was possible because those diagnosed with AS seem more neurotypical in early childhood development. The siblings of individuals diagnosed with AS were shown to have a lesser variant of ToM deficits. This shows that the cognitive deficits affecting ToM play a central role in the phenotype expressed in AS diagnoses.<ref name=\"ozonoff\">{{cite journal | last=Ozonoff | first=S | author2=Rogers, S. & Pennington, B. | title=Asperger's syndrome: Evidence for an empirical distinction from high-functioning autism | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | date=November 1991 |volume=32 | issue=7 | pages=1107\u20131122 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1991.tb00352.x| pmid=1787139 }}</ref> However, since today\u2019s perceptive about autism and Asperger disorder has changed, Ozonoff research might no longer be considered among other scholars.

Unlike autism, schizophrenia is a late onset condition. It is speculated that this difference in the condition may account for differences seen in the ToM abilities.<ref>{{cite book | title=Other Minds.

However, it is unknown whether the ToM in schizophrenia deteriorates in the affected person as the condition progresses.<ref name=\"brune\" />\n\nThe cognitive impairment linked to mind-blindness is best explained by a modular theory; the domain specific capabilities that account for mindreading and mentalization are lost in schizophrenia. Some studies conducted at this regard, have been administrated by Cleghorn and Albert (1990), who strived to understand schizophrenia from multiple angles, such as neurobiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive science. They found that despite \u201cindividual modules of cognitive and emotional function may be intact in schizophrenia, messages are inappropriately sent to parts of the brain not specialized for the required information [\u2026]thus, \u201cmodular disjunction\u201d of widely distributed neural systems develops, causing the signs and symptoms of schizophrenic psychosis.\u201d <ref>{{Citation|last=Cleghorn|first=John M.|title=Modular Disjunction in Schizophrenia: A Framework for a Pathological Psychophysiology|date=1990|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-3248-3_3|work=International Perspectives Series: Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience|pages=59\u201380|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=978-0-387-97221-3|access-date=2020-04-05|last2=Albert|first2=Martin L.}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Frith has predicted that the extent of mind-blindness depends on whether the objective/behavioural or subjective symptoms of ToM abilities prevail.<ref name=\"cory\" /> Patients with the behavioural symptoms perform the poorest in ToM tasks, similar to autistic subjects, while patients displaying subjective/experiential symptoms have a ToM. However, these patients are impaired in using contextual information to infer what these mental states are.<ref name=\"brune\" />\n\nAdditionally, it is important to affirm that some scholars have decided to look deeper at Frith\u2019s work and review/ critique her theory. In fact, in their work ''Theory of mind in schizophrenia: A critical review'', Professors Harrington, Siegert, and McClure (2005), have affirmed that the theory proposed by Uta Frith has not few issues that need to be redirected. For instance, \u201cissues that demand further clarification include: Is the deficit a state or a trait? How to measure ToM in schizophrenia research, and whether certain symptoms or groups of symptoms are associated with the ToM deficit\". <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Leigh|last2=Siegert|first2=Richard|last3=McClure|first3=John|date=2005-08|title=Theory of mind in schizophrenia: A critical review|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13546800444000056|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|volume=10|issue=4|pages=249\u2013286|doi=10.1080/13546800444000056|issn=1354-6805}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe mind-blindness theory helps to explain the impairment in the social development of individuals as well as the impairment in the communication skills of autistics. However one of the most important limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait attributed to autistic people. This triad is explained through the process of systemising.<ref name=cohen2 /> The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism.<ref name=cory /> These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autistic people, fails to explain such patients' penchants for narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis.  Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to autistic people, since conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] to various [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s and/or [[anti-social personality disorder]]s all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.<ref name=\"cohen\" />\n\nAnother issue associated with the mind-blindness theory is that researchers are unable to predict whether the social deficits are a primary or secondary result of mind-blindness. In addition, Klin and his fellow researchers highlighted another limitation that was that the mind-blindness theory failed to delineate whether the ToM deficits are a generalised deficit or a specific discrete of a mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klin, Ami., Folkmar, Fred R., Sparrow, Sara S.| title=Autistic Social Dysfunction: Some limitations of the Theory of Mind hypothesis | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=861\u2013876 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01961.x| pmid=1378847 }}</ref> Stuart Shanker also argued in favour of Klin's argument, that a major part of the mind-blindness theory depicts the ToM as an autonomous cognitive capacity compared to being part of a more general ability for reflective thinking and empathy.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Shanker | first=S. | title=The Roots of Mindblindness |journal=[[Theory & Psychology]] | date=1 October 2004 | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=685\u2013703 | doi=10.1177/0959354304046179}}</ref> \n[[File:Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|A boy with autism, obsessively stacking cans.]]\n\nOther researchers have pointed out the inherent flaws of assuming autistic traits develops from a \"theory of mind\" deficit, pointing out that this presupposes autistic traits derives from a single, core insufficiency within the brain.  This contrasts, they say, with the very same researchers' description of autism as a \"puzzle\", which implies a far more diverse range of causes than a single, unifying theory.<ref name=\"smukler\">{{cite journal | author=Smukler, David | title=Unauthorized Minds: How 'Theory of Mind' Theory Misrepresents Autism | journal=Mental Retardation | date=February 2005 | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=11\u201324 | doi=10.1352/0047-6765(2005)43<11:UMHTOM>2.0.CO;2 | pmid=15628930}}</ref>\n\nMany have also pointed out that Mind-blindness wrongly categorizes autism as a problem to be fixed, rather than a condition to be accommodated. This assumes an inherent lack of [[intelligence]]{{how|date=April 2020}} in individuals affected by autism, which ignores the nuanced view of intelligence (as in varying types of intelligence) that has been observed in cognitive research.<ref name=\"smukler\" />\n\nThe drawbacks in the Mind-blindness theory of individuals diagnosed with autism paved way for the [[Empathizing\u2013systemizing theory|E-S theory]] which helps to explain the observations seen in these individuals. The E-S theory accounts for both the triad of deficits which is the loss of empathising and the triad of strengths is related to hyper systemisation of certain behaviours. The theory also helps to explain the exaggerated male spectrum termed as the extreme male behavior.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen | first=S. | author2=Knickmeyer, Rebecca S. | author3= Belmonte, Mathew S. | title=Sex Differences in the Brain: Implications for Explaining Autism | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=4 November 2005 | volume=310 | issue=5749 | pages=819\u2013823 | doi=10.1126/science.1115455 | pmid=16272115| url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/2710/1/219535_PubSub1971_Belmonte.pdf | bibcode=2005Sci...310..819B }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alexithymia]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Geoffrey Cowley, \"Understanding Autism,\" ''Newsweek'', July 31, 2000.\n*[[Simon Baron-Cohen]], \"First lessons in mind reading,\" ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'', July 16, 1995.\n*Suddendorf, T., & Whiten, A.

It was operated through most of its existence by [[Manchester Boddy]]. The publication has no connection with the [[Los Angeles Daily News|current newspaper]] of the same name.\n\nThe ''Daily News'' was founded in 1923 by the young [[Cornelius Vanderbilt IV]] as the first of several newspapers he wanted to manage. After quickly going bankrupt, it was sold to Boddy, a businessman with no newspaper experience. Boddy was able to make the newspaper succeed, and it remained profitable through the 1930s and 1940s, taking a mainstream [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic perspective]]. The newspaper began a steep decline in the late 1940s, which continued into the early 1950s. [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|In 1950]], Boddy [[cross-filing|ran in both the]] Democratic and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primaries for the [[United States Senate]]. Boddy finished a distant second in both primaries, and lost interest in the newspaper. He sold his interest in the paper in 1952, and publication ceased in December 1954, when the business was sold to the Chandler family, who merged it with their publication, the [[Los Angeles Mirror|Los Angeles ''Mirror'']].\n\nThere was an earlier ''Los Angeles Daily News,'' under different ownership, beginning in 1869.\n\n== Founding and initial bankruptcy ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00023, Cornelius Vanderbilt jr..jpg|thumb|upright|Vanderbilt in 1926]]\nThe Los Angeles ''Illustrated Daily News'' was founded in 1923 by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt IV]], who wished to start his own newspaper chain.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=292}} The young Vanderbilt had served as a news reporter in New York for four years, but had no experience running a paper. Believing the best newspaper was a democratic one, he offered voting rights to those who would pay $5 for a year's subscription to his newspaper.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=50\u201351}}  Repudiating the legendary adage of [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], \"The public be damned,\" Vanderbilt announced that the paper's philosophy would be \"The public be served.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=51\u201352}} Vanderbilt refused to lead the lifestyle of the idle rich\u2014he had enlisted as a private in World War I\u2014and believed the West Coast would become as important to the United States as the East Coast until then had been. [[Lord Northcliffe]], founder of London's ''[[Daily Mail]]'', encouraged Vanderbilt to start a chain of serious-minded [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] in the West, a contrast to Northcliffe's own racy newspapers.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=162}}\n\nVanderbilt ignored attempts by the newspaper moguls who dominated Los Angeles journalism, [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Harry Chandler]], to warn him off. Denied advertising in other newspapers, Vanderbilt attempted to gain publicity for his paper by having trucks drive through the streets bearing the paper's banner, and  hiring boys to chalk the paper's name on sidewalks, much to the annoyance of landowners who had to clean it up.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=51\u201352}} He bought a former automobile showroom at the corner of [[Pico Boulevard]] and Los Angeles Street, and furnished it with the latest equipment. As Vanderbilt prepared for a August 1923 opening (pushed back to the following month), potential investors toured the building, attracted by high-pressure sales tactics and the promise of a free lunch.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=162}}\n\nUnusually for Los Angeles at the time, the paper's plant was a [[union shop]], something Vanderbilt insisted on.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=162}} The paper began publication on September 3, 1923,{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=56}} and was helped in its launch by the fact that the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Tokyo Earthquake]] had just happened; it was able to provide full coverage, though using stock photographs of Japan. The initial price was one cent a copy.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|pp=162, 165}} The tabloid format newspaper was to be devoted to the ideal of clean journalism, and was prudish to an extreme:  women's skirts were retouched in photos so that they would appear to cover the wearer's knees, while photos of wrestlers were altered so that they would appear to be wearing gym shirts.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=292}} Vanderbilt's rivals did not take well to the new competition\u2014a graphic sex story was planted by saboteurs in the first edition, forcing Vanderbilt to stop the presses and redo page 2 before it was published. Up to a hundred ''Illustrated Daily News'' newsboys were treated at local hospitals each week after being assaulted.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=57\u201358}} Nevertheless, Vanderbilt in December 1923 expanded to San Francisco with the ''Illustrated Daily Herald'' and in February 1925 to Miami\u2014the ''Illustrated Daily Tab'' was intended to cash in on the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida land boom]].{{sfn|Hensher|1976|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nThe newspaper covered its staff's transportation, something rare at the time. Reporters were expected to carry rolls of nickels, so they could board [[streetcar]]s and reach their assignments. However, if they had sufficient money with them, a taxicab was permitted, and Vanderbilt\u2014\"Neil\" to the staff\u2014let the staff use his two [[Packard]]s to reach stories. Too often, however, the least experienced newsman on staff, Vanderbilt himself, would cover major stories. According to Rob Wagner in his history of Los Angeles newspapers of the time, Vanderbilt's \"news stories reeked of naivet\u00e9 and his editorials were sophomoric.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=61}} Among Vanderbilt's editorial targets were the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], the Bank of Italy (later the [[Bank of America]]) and the [[Pacific Electric Railway]]\u2014the paper deemed its streetcars a danger to pedestrians and termed them \"red reapers\".{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=164}}\n\nBy 1924, the newspaper had a good circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured over a million dollars into the newspaper in 1924\u20131925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the ''Illustrated Daily News'' and the two other newspapers could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, Vanderbilt's father refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=64\u201365}} Of the chain's three newspapers, the ''Daily News'' was deemed the most salvageable\u2014the other two closed within weeks.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=168}}\n\n== Boddy takes over ==\nA consortium of the publishers of the rivals of the  ''Illustrated Daily News'' offered $150,000 to buy the paper, intending to shut it down. Los Angeles businessman Willis Lewis had invested heavily in the paper, and he put together a rival bid backed by the paper's outside shareholders, backing book publishing executive [[Manchester Boddy]] to take over the paper and keep it as a going concern.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=71\u201372}}  The stockholder's committee got the Vanderbilt family to sign over a $1&nbsp;million note so that they could top the rival bid, and raised $30,000 for a month's payroll.{{sfn|''New York Times'' 1967\u201305\u201314, Boddy obit}} Boddy and Lewis both served on the Commercial Board, a group of young businessmen; the new publisher got Board members to lend him $116,000 to buy a controlling interest in the paper, but if the paper did not show a profit within six months, the lenders could repossess.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=292\u2013293}} Boddy once commented, \"The ''Daily News'' was conceived in iniquity, born in bankruptcy, reared in panic, and refinanced every six months.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=90}} According to [[Marion Davies]], the mistress of [[William Randolph Hearst]], in her 1975 memoirs, 51% of the ''Daily News'' was actually owned by Hearst.{{sfn|Davies|1975|p=249}}\n\nThe new publisher scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, and began a campaign against vice. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles police]] chief, [[James E. Davis (police)|James E. Davis]], had a hands-off policy when it came to vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=72\u201374}}  After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, but circulation rose.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=293}} Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=85}} By 1929, the ''Daily News'' was showing a profit,{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=168}} and three years later, amid [[the Depression]], began publishing  a [[broadsheet]] edition, raising its price from two to three cents. Boddy stated that with a circulation of 150,000, the paper was profitable even without advertising.<ref>{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Daily News expands in prosperity|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 6, 1932|page=14}}</ref>  By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word \"Illustrated\" from the name of the paper.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=86}}\n\nDuring the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the ''Daily News'' maintained a conservative editorial policy. He was a personal supporter of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s bid for reelection in 1932. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support the Democratic candidate, New York Governor [[Franklin Roosevelt]], and Boddy and the ''Daily News'' volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: \"They have made a terrible mistake. I helped them do it. But damn it, I had to make a living.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=86}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt's election, the nation waited with anticipation for the specifics of the \"[[New Deal]]\" plan on which he had campaigned. Boddy had no more information than anyone else, but had been impressed by a program called \"[[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]],\" which proposed replacing politicians with scientists and engineers possessing the technical expertise to coordinate the economy, a scheme that Roosevelt did not advocate. On November 30, 1932, the ''Daily News'' printed a huge headline \"New Deal Details Bared\". The article contained no inside information, and actually did not even mention Roosevelt, but instead outlined Technocracy. He continued to discuss Technocracy for weeks, as the people of Los Angeles, desperate for plausible information from any source, bought copies of the ''Daily News'', even invading the paper's loading dock to get them as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=86\u201387}} Even after Roosevelt took office, the ''Daily News'' trumpeted proposals to give money to the nation's citizens, such as [[Francis Townsend]]'s plan that the federal government give $200 a month to every citizen over age 60. The ''Daily News'' also gave space to the \"Ham 'n' Eggs\" plan whereby the elderly would get checks for $30 every Thursday. Boddy hit the lecture circuit to advocate [[social credit]], another plan for the government to return taxes to the citizenry.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nWhen the New Deal finally was revealed, Boddy became an avid supporter of it, and so did his newspaper,{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=298}} making it the only Democratic daily in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=86\u201387}} In 1934, writer [[Upton Sinclair]] ran for the Democratic nomination for governor, advocating the [[End Poverty in California movement|End Poverty in California]] (EPIC) program. When Sinclair scored a surprise upset victory in the Democratic primary against [[George Creel]], most newspapers closed ranks against him and supported the Republican candidate, [[Frank Merriam]]. The ''Daily News'', on the other hand, opened its front page to Sinclair's program and called him \"a great man.\"  Though the ''Daily News'' eventually endorsed Merriam, its objection was not that the program was too radical, but that it was not consistent with the New Deal. This did not stop Sinclair from being embittered at what he saw as a betrayal by the ''Daily News'', accusing  Boddy of \"leading liberal movements up blind alleys and bludgeoning them.\"{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=298\u2013299}}\n\nIn 1935, Boddy acquired the ''Los Angeles Record'', changing its name to the ''Evening News''. The two papers were subsequently merged under the ''Daily News'' name.<ref name = \"ny times\">{{cite news|title=Daily News sold in Los Angeles|page=74|date=December 19, 1954|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n== Decline and fall ==\n{{see also|1950 United States Senate election in California}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Los Angeles Daily News 8-07-1945.jpg|thumb|left|Front page headline of the ''Los Angeles Daily News'' dated August 7, 1945 announcing the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].]] -->\nLike most newspapers, the ''Daily News'' prospered during [[World War II]]. Its readership peaked in 1947, when an average 300,000&nbsp;copies per day were sold. In both absolute and relative terms, however, it was falling further and further behind the other Los Angeles dailies. In addition, Boddy, who was now past sixty, was losing interest in the management of the paper.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=302\u2013303}} Fierce competition from the new Chandler family tabloid, the [[Los Angeles Mirror|Los Angeles ''Mirror'']], also hurt circulation and profits.<ref name = \"monitor\" /> Nevertheless, Boddy advanced money to keep the paper in business, lending nearly $2 million to fund its operations between 1948 and 1952, funds for which he did not seek repayment in the paper's subsequent bankruptcy.<ref name = \"bankruptcy\" >{{cite news|title=McKinnon Testifies on Daily News' Dying Days: Thousands of Dollars Poured Into Paper, Ex-Publisher Tells Bankruptcy Referee|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 4, 1955|p=6}}</ref>  The ''Daily News'' was the only Democratic newspaper in Los Angeles in the postwar years, featuring columns by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], with cartoons by [[Herb Block]].<ref name = \"monitor\" >{{cite news|title=Los Angeles News 'Folds': No Longer a Tabloid Partisans Skeptical Publishers Traced Heroic Effort|first=Richard Dyer|last=MacCann|newspaper= [[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=December 28, 1954|p=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, feeling that he was repeating himself in print, Boddy sought the Democratic nomination for United States Senate.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=302\u2013303}} Boddy was tapped to enter the race when incumbent [[Sheridan Downey]] dropped out during the primary. Democratic establishment figures distrusted the remaining major Democratic candidate, liberal Congresswoman [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]], and feared that a Douglas victory would hand the election to the likely Republican candidate, Representative [[Richard M. Nixon]]. ''Daily News'' staffers believed that Boddy was abandoning his journalistic integrity in running. Boddy ran in both major party primaries, a practice known as \"[[cross filing]].\"  His campaign was ineffective, and he finished a distant second in each primary.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=267\u2013269}}  During the campaign, he dubbed Douglas \"the pink lady\" in the ''Daily News'', a nickname which was reused by the Nixon campaign in [[1950 United States Senate election in California|the general election]].{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=267\u2013269}} Just before the primary, when Nixon, who along with Douglas had also cross-filed, sent out election materials which did not mention that he was a Republican, an ad appeared in the ''Daily News'' from the hitherto-unknown \"Veterans Democratic Committee\". The advertisement accused Nixon of masquerading as a Democrat, and dubbed him \"Tricky Dick\"\u2014the first appearance of that Nixon moniker.{{sfn|Gellman|1999|p=303}} Nixon went on to win the general election in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]].{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=267\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Boddy for Senate.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A flyer or handout for Manchester Boddy.|A flyer for Boddy's election campaign, which described him as \"the Democrat everybody wants for U.S. senator.\"]]\nAfter the primary defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from sales of the ''Daily News'' began to decrease.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=304}} In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=269}} In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=304}} In August 1952, Boddy announced his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a ''Sunday News''.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=269}} He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, [[Sheldon F. Sackett]]. After signing, Smith backed out of the deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman [[Clinton D. McKinnon]], who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the ''Daily News'' was losing over $100,000 a month.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=271\u2013273}}\n\nMcKinnon related that he had been approached by labor leaders who wanted to keep the ''Daily News'' in business, but after the paper was purchased, much of their support failed to materialize. He went to \"every wealthy liberal person I ever heard of\", seeking money to keep the paper in business.<ref name = \"bankruptcy\" />  He was able to increase circulation by 20,000 and halve the annual million dollar loss. Creditors pressed for repayment of debt,<ref name = \"monitor\" /> and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the ''Mirror''. Under the sale agreement, the ''Mirror'' became the ''Mirror & Daily News'' (before again being renamed the ''Mirror-News'').

It was operated through most of its existence by [[Manchester Boddy]]. The publication has no connection with the [[Los Angeles Daily News|current newspaper]] of the same name.\n\nThe ''Daily News'' was founded in 1923 by the young [[Cornelius Vanderbilt IV]] as the first of several newspapers he wanted to manage. After quickly going bankrupt, it was sold to Boddy, a businessman with no newspaper experience. Boddy was able to make the newspaper succeed, and it remained profitable through the 1930s and 1940s, taking a mainstream [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic perspective]]. The newspaper began a steep decline in the late 1940s, which continued into the early 1950s. [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|In 1950]], Boddy [[cross-filing|ran in both the]] Democratic and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primaries for the [[United States Senate]]. Boddy finished a distant second in both primaries, and lost interest in the newspaper. He sold his interest in the paper in 1952, and publication ceased in December 1954, when the business was sold to the Chandler family, who merged it with their publication, the [[Los Angeles Mirror|Los Angeles ''Mirror'']].\n\nThere was an earlier ''Los Angeles Daily News,'' under different ownership, beginning in 1869.\n\n== Founding and initial bankruptcy ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00023, Cornelius Vanderbilt jr..jpg|thumb|upright|Vanderbilt in 1926]]\nThe Los Angeles ''Illustrated Daily News'' was founded in 1923 by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt IV]], who wished to start his own newspaper chain.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=292}} The young Vanderbilt had served as a news reporter in New York for four years, but had no experience running a paper. Believing the best newspaper was a democratic one, he offered voting rights to those who would pay $5 for a year's subscription to his newspaper.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=50\u201351}}  Repudiating the legendary adage of [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], \"The public be damned,\" Vanderbilt announced that the paper's philosophy would be \"The public be served.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=51\u201352}} Vanderbilt refused to lead the lifestyle of the idle rich\u2014he had enlisted as a private in World War I\u2014and believed the West Coast would become as important to the United States as the East Coast until then had been. [[Lord Northcliffe]], founder of London's ''[[Daily Mail]]'', encouraged Vanderbilt to start a chain of serious-minded [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] in the West, a contrast to Northcliffe's own racy newspapers.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=162}}\n\nVanderbilt ignored attempts by the newspaper moguls who dominated Los Angeles journalism, [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Harry Chandler]], to warn him off. Denied advertising in other newspapers, Vanderbilt attempted to gain publicity for his paper by having trucks drive through the streets bearing the paper's banner, and  hiring boys to chalk the paper's name on sidewalks, much to the annoyance of landowners who had to clean it up.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=51\u201352}} He bought a former automobile showroom at the corner of [[Pico Boulevard]] and Los Angeles Street, and furnished it with the latest equipment. As Vanderbilt prepared for a August 1923 opening (pushed back to the following month), potential investors toured the building, attracted by high-pressure sales tactics and the promise of a free lunch.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=162}}\n\nUnusually for Los Angeles at the time, the paper's plant was a [[union shop]], something Vanderbilt insisted on.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=162}} The paper began publication on September 3, 1923,{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=56}} and was helped in its launch by the fact that the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Tokyo Earthquake]] had just happened; it was able to provide full coverage, though using stock photographs of Japan. The initial price was one cent a copy.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|pp=162, 165}} The tabloid format newspaper was to be devoted to the ideal of clean journalism, and was prudish to an extreme:  women's skirts were retouched in photos so that they would appear to cover the wearer's knees, while photos of wrestlers were altered so that they would appear to be wearing gym shirts.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=292}} Vanderbilt's rivals did not take well to the new competition\u2014a graphic sex story was planted by saboteurs in the first edition, forcing Vanderbilt to stop the presses and redo page 2 before it was published. Up to a hundred ''Illustrated Daily News'' newsboys were treated at local hospitals each week after being assaulted.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=57\u201358}} Nevertheless, Vanderbilt in December 1923 expanded to San Francisco with the ''Illustrated Daily Herald'' and in February 1925 to Miami\u2014the ''Illustrated Daily Tab'' was intended to cash in on the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida land boom]].{{sfn|Hensher|1976|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nThe newspaper covered its staff's transportation, something rare at the time. Reporters were expected to carry rolls of nickels, so they could board [[streetcar]]s and reach their assignments. However, if they had sufficient money with them, a taxicab was permitted, and Vanderbilt\u2014\"Neil\" to the staff\u2014let the staff use his two [[Packard]]s to reach stories. Too often, however, the least experienced newsman on staff, Vanderbilt himself, would cover major stories. According to Rob Wagner in his history of Los Angeles newspapers of the time, Vanderbilt's \"news stories reeked of naivet\u00e9 and his editorials were sophomoric.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=61}} Among Vanderbilt's editorial targets were the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], the Bank of Italy (later the [[Bank of America]]) and the [[Pacific Electric Railway]]\u2014the paper deemed its streetcars a danger to pedestrians and termed them \"red reapers\".{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=164}}\n\nBy 1924, the newspaper had a good circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured over a million dollars into the newspaper in 1924\u20131925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the ''Illustrated Daily News'' and the two other newspapers could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, Vanderbilt's father refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=64\u201365}} Of the chain's three newspapers, the ''Daily News'' was deemed the most salvageable\u2014the other two closed within weeks.{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=168}}\n\n== Boddy takes over ==\nA consortium of the publishers of the rivals of the  ''Illustrated Daily News'' offered $150,000 to buy the paper, intending to shut it down. Los Angeles businessman Willis Lewis had invested heavily in the paper, and he put together a rival bid backed by the paper's outside shareholders, backing book publishing executive [[Manchester Boddy]] to take over the paper and keep it as a going concern.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=71\u201372}}  The stockholder's committee got the Vanderbilt family to sign over a $1&nbsp;million note so that they could top the rival bid, and raised $30,000 for a month's payroll.{{sfn|''New York Times'' 1967\u201305\u201314, Boddy obit}} Boddy and Lewis both served on the Commercial Board, a group of young businessmen; the new publisher got Board members to lend him $116,000 to buy a controlling interest in the paper, but if the paper did not show a profit within six months, the lenders could repossess..{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=292\u2013293}} Boddy once commented, \"The ''Daily News'' was conceived in iniquity, born in bankruptcy, reared in panic, and refinanced every six months.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=90}} According to [[Marion Davies]], the mistress of [[William Randolph Hearst]], in her 1975 memoirs, 51% of the ''Daily News'' was actually owned by Hearst.{{sfn|Davies|1975|p=249}}\n\nThe new publisher scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, and began a campaign against vice. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles police]] chief, [[James E. Davis (police)|James E. Davis]], had a hands-off policy when it came to vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=72\u201374}}  After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, but circulation rose.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=293}} Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=85}} By 1929, the ''Daily News'' was showing a profit,{{sfn|Hensher|1976|p=168}} and three years later, amid [[the Depression]], began publishing  a [[broadsheet]] edition, raising its price from two to three cents. Boddy stated that with a circulation of 150,000, the paper was profitable even without advertising.<ref>{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Daily News expands in prosperity|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 6, 1932|page=14}}</ref>  By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word \"Illustrated\" from the name of the paper.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=86}}\n\nDuring the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the ''Daily News'' maintained a conservative editorial policy. He was a personal supporter of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s bid for reelection in 1932. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support the Democratic candidate, New York Governor [[Franklin Roosevelt]], and Boddy and the ''Daily News'' volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: \"They have made a terrible mistake. I helped them do it. But damn it, I had to make a living.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=86}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt's election, the nation waited with anticipation for the specifics of the \"[[New Deal]]\" plan on which he had campaigned. Boddy had no more information than anyone else, but had been impressed by a program called \"[[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]],\" which proposed replacing politicians with scientists and engineers possessing the technical expertise to coordinate the economy, a scheme that Roosevelt did not advocate. On November 30, 1932, the ''Daily News'' printed a huge headline \"New Deal Details Bared\". The article contained no inside information, and actually did not even mention Roosevelt, but instead outlined Technocracy. He continued to discuss Technocracy for weeks, as the people of Los Angeles, desperate for plausible information from any source, bought copies of the ''Daily News'', even invading the paper's loading dock to get them as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=86\u201387}} Even after Roosevelt took office, the ''Daily News'' trumpeted proposals to give money to the nation's citizens, such as [[Francis Townsend]]'s plan that the federal government give $200 a month to every citizen over age 60. The ''Daily News'' also gave space to the \"Ham 'n' Eggs\" plan whereby the elderly would get checks for $30 every Thursday. Boddy hit the lecture circuit to advocate [[social credit]], another plan for the government to return taxes to the citizenry.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nWhen the New Deal finally was revealed, Boddy became an avid supporter of it, and so did his newspaper,{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=298}} making it the only Democratic daily in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=86\u201387}} In 1934, writer [[Upton Sinclair]] ran for the Democratic nomination for governor, advocating the [[End Poverty in California movement|End Poverty in California]] (EPIC) program. When Sinclair scored a surprise upset victory in the Democratic primary against [[George Creel]], most newspapers closed ranks against him and supported the Republican candidate, [[Frank Merriam]]. The ''Daily News'', on the other hand, opened its front page to Sinclair's program and called him \"a great man.\"  Though the ''Daily News'' eventually endorsed Merriam, its objection was not that the program was too radical, but that it was not consistent with the New Deal. This did not stop Sinclair from being embittered at what he saw as a betrayal by the ''Daily News'', accusing  Boddy of \"leading liberal movements up blind alleys and bludgeoning them.\"{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=298\u2013299}}\n\nIn 1935, Boddy acquired the ''Los Angeles Record'', changing its name to the ''Evening News''. The two papers were subsequently merged under the ''Daily News'' name.<ref name = \"ny times\">{{cite news|title=Daily News sold in Los Angeles|page=74|date=December 19, 1954|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n== Decline and fall ==\n{{see also|1950 United States Senate election in California}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Los Angeles Daily News 8-07-1945.jpg|thumb|left|Front page headline of the ''Los Angeles Daily News'' dated August 7, 1945 announcing the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].]] -->\nLike most newspapers, the ''Daily News'' prospered during [[World War II]]. Its readership peaked in 1947, when an average 300,000&nbsp;copies per day were sold. In both absolute and relative terms, however, it was falling further and further behind the other Los Angeles dailies. In addition, Boddy, who was now past sixty, was losing interest in the management of the paper.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=302\u2013303}} Fierce competition from the new Chandler family tabloid, the [[Los Angeles Mirror|Los Angeles ''Mirror'']], also hurt circulation and profits.<ref name = \"monitor\" /> Nevertheless, Boddy advanced money to keep the paper in business, lending nearly $2 million to fund its operations between 1948 and 1952, funds for which he did not seek repayment in the paper's subsequent bankruptcy.<ref name = \"bankruptcy\" >{{cite news|title=McKinnon Testifies on Daily News' Dying Days: Thousands of Dollars Poured Into Paper, Ex-Publisher Tells Bankruptcy Referee|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 4, 1955|p=6}}</ref>  The ''Daily News'' was the only Democratic newspaper in Los Angeles in the postwar years, featuring columns by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], with cartoons by [[Herb Block]].<ref name = \"monitor\" >{{cite news|title=Los Angeles News 'Folds': No Longer a Tabloid Partisans Skeptical Publishers Traced Heroic Effort|first=Richard Dyer|last=MacCann|newspaper= [[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=December 28, 1954|p=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, feeling that he was repeating himself in print, Boddy sought the Democratic nomination for United States Senate.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|pp=302\u2013303}} Boddy was tapped to enter the race when incumbent [[Sheridan Downey]] dropped out during the primary. Democratic establishment figures distrusted the remaining major Democratic candidate, liberal Congresswoman [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]], and feared that a Douglas victory would hand the election to the likely Republican candidate, Representative [[Richard M. Nixon]]. ''Daily News'' staffers believed that Boddy was abandoning his journalistic integrity in running. Boddy ran in both major party primaries, a practice known as \"[[cross filing]].\"  His campaign was ineffective, and he finished a distant second in each primary.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=267\u2013269}}  During the campaign, he dubbed Douglas \"the pink lady\" in the ''Daily News'', a nickname which was reused by the Nixon campaign in [[1950 United States Senate election in California|the general election]].{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=267\u2013269}} Just before the primary, when Nixon, who along with Douglas had also cross-filed, sent out election materials which did not mention that he was a Republican, an ad appeared in the ''Daily News'' from the hitherto-unknown \"Veterans Democratic Committee\". The advertisement accused Nixon of masquerading as a Democrat, and dubbed him \"Tricky Dick\"\u2014the first appearance of that Nixon moniker.{{sfn|Gellman|1999|p=303}} Nixon went on to win the general election in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]].{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=267\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Boddy for Senate.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A flyer or handout for Manchester Boddy.|A flyer for Boddy's election campaign, which described him as \"the Democrat everybody wants for U.S. senator.\"]]\nAfter the primary defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from sales of the ''Daily News'' began to decrease.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=304}} In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=269}} In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium.{{sfn|Rosenstone|1970|p=304}} In August 1952, Boddy announced his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a ''Sunday News''.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|p=269}} He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, [[Sheldon F. Sackett]]. After signing, Smith backed out of the deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman [[Clinton D. McKinnon]], who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the ''Daily News'' was losing over $100,000 a month.{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=271\u2013273}} \n\nMcKinnon related that he had been approached by labor leaders who wanted to keep the ''Daily News'' in business, but after the paper was purchased, much of their support failed to materialize. He went to \"every wealthy liberal person I ever heard of\", seeking money to keep the paper in business.<ref name = \"bankruptcy\" />  He was able to increase circulation by 20,000 and halve the annual million dollar loss. Creditors pressed for repayment of debt,<ref name = \"monitor\" /> and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the ''Mirror''. Under the sale agreement, the ''Mirror'' became the ''Mirror & Daily News'' (before again being renamed the ''Mirror-News''). On December 18, 1954, publication of the ''Daily News'' ceased with all employees losing their jobs{{sfn|Wagner|2000|pp=255\u2013257}} without severance pay.<ref name = \"monitor\" /> At its end, the ''Daily News'' was a six-column large tabloid and had a circulation of 195,000, published every day but Sunday.<ref name = \"ny times\" /> Subsequent bankruptcy proceedings revealed that Boddy, Smith and McKinnon each took large losses in the paper's final years.<ref name = \"bankruptcy\" />\n\n''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'''s West Coast correspondent, Richard Dyer MacCann, stated when the ''Daily News'' folded, \n{{quote|The surprise for most observers has been the staying power of this independent daily with its inadequate staff, its worn-out presses, and its fluctuating circulation and advertising income in face of rising costs.

(The Frater should normally extend at right-angles to the south range.) On the west side of the cloister was a wall separating it from an open area or lane, beyond which the western range stood.

It was not until 1459 that Oxford committed himself to [[Margaret of Anjou]] against the Duke of York. In December of that year and in April 1460 he was appointed to lead anti-Yorkist [[commission of array|commissions of array]] in Essex, and by May 1460 his eldest son, Sir Aubrey Vere, who had recently married Anne, the daughter of [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], was reported to be \u2018great with the Queen\u2019.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castor|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson|2004|p=674}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:London Tower Hill Scaffold Site.JPG|thumb|Site of the scaffold on Tower Hill]]\nAfter the [[House of York|Yorkist]] victory at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in July 1460, Oxford appears to have suffered from ill health. In November of that year he was exempted, \u2018in consideration of his infirmities\u2019, from appearing in person before the King or in Council or Parliament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1945|p=237}}; {{Harvnb|Castor|2004}}.</ref> If he was feigning illness in order to maintain a low profile in the face of the new Yorkist regime under [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]], the ploy was unsuccessful. In February 1462 Oxford was arrested, together with his son Aubrey and [[Thomas Tuddenham|Sir Thomas Tuddenham]], his former opponent in Norfolk and now a fellow [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] loyalist, and convicted of high treason before the [[Constable of England]], [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester]]. On 26 February 1462 Oxford was executed on [[Tower Hill]], by [[disembowelment]], [[castration]] and [[death by burning|burning]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Weir|1996|p=309}}</ref> Then he was buried in the church of the [[Austin Friars, London]]. His eldest son, Aubrey, had been [[decapitation|beheaded]] six days earlier, and Oxford was therefore succeeded by his second son, [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Castor|2004}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nOxford married, between 22 May and 31 August 1425, Elizabeth Howard (c. 1410\u20131475), the only child and heiress of Sir John Howard, 7th Lord Plaiz (c. 1385/6 \u2013 c. 1409), and his wife Joan Walton, the daughter of John Walton of [[Wivenhoe]], Essex and Margery Sutton,<ref>The History and Antiquities of the County of Norfolk, Volume 6 By Mostyn John Armstrong p. 159</ref> by whom he had five sons and three daughters:{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=238}}{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=23}}\n\n*Sir Aubrey Vere,{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}} who married Anne Stafford, daughter of [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham]]\n*[[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]] (1442\u20131513).{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}}\n*Sir George Vere, who married Margaret Stafford, daughter and heiress of Sir William Stafford of [[Bishop's Frome]], [[Herefordshire]], by whom he had two sons, George Vere and [[John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford]], and four daughters, Elizabeth, who married [[Sir Anthony Wingfield]] of [[Letheringham]], [[Suffolk]]; Margaret; Dorothy, who married [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Latimer]]; and Ursula, who married firstly George Windsor (d. 1520), eldest son and heir of [[Andrew Windsor, 1st Baron Windsor]], who predeceased his father, and secondly [[Sir Edmund Knightley]].{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273, 276}}\n*Sir Richard Vere, who married Margaret, daughter of Sir Henry Percy and widow of  Henry, 3rd [[Baron Grey of Codnor]].{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}}\n*Sir Thomas Vere.{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}}\n*Mary Vere, a nun at [[Barking Abbey]].{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=23}}{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}}\n*Joan (or Jane) Vere, who married [[Sir William Norreys]], {{sfn|Ross|2011|pp=23, 45, 80}}{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}} and was the maternal grandmother of [[William Petre#First Wife: Gertrude Tyrell|Gertrude Tyrell]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n*Elizabeth Vere, who married William Bourchier.{{sfn|Ross|2011|pp=23, 80}}{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=273}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Capital Punishment UK homepage.
