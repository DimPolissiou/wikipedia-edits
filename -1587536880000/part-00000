This was the Crimson Tide's 125th overall season, 86th as a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), and 28th within the SEC's [[Southeastern Conference#Current members|Western Division]]. They played their home games at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and were led by 13th-year head coach [[Nick Saban]].\n\nThe defending national runners-up, Alabama began the season ranked second in the AP Poll, and were the favorites to repeat as SEC Champions. The Crimson Tide won their first seven games of the year handily, and rose to first in the AP Poll, but were ranked third in the first [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the year heading into an anticipated match-up against second-ranked [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which Alabama lost 46\u201341. The next week, Alabama lost starting quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]] to a season-ending hip injury in the game against [[2019 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. They finished the regular season with a 48\u201345 loss to rival [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]].\n\nWith a regular season record of 10\u20132, Alabama was not selected for the [[College Football Playoff]] for the first time since the inception of the format in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. While the Crimson Tide were not invited to a [[New Year's Six]] bowl game, they defeated [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]].\n\nQuarterback Tua Tagovailoa, at the time of his injury, was considered a candidate for the Heisman Trophy and was on pace to break his own NCAA FBS passer rating record. He was replaced by backup [[Mac Jones]] for the remainder of the season. Running back [[Najee Harris]] led the team with 1,224 rushing yards and 20 total touchdowns, tied for the SEC lead. Receivers [[Jerry Jeudy]] and [[Devonta Smith]] were both named All-SEC. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference players linebacker [[Anfernee Jennings]] and safety [[Xavier McKinney]].\n\n==Previous season==\nIn [[2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2018]], Alabama went undefeated in the regular season and won the [[2018 SEC Championship Game]] over [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. The Crimson Tide entered the [[College Football Playoff]] as the number one seed, winning the semi-final played at the [[2018 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] over [[2018 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] before falling to [[2018 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship]].\n\n==Offseason==\n===Position key===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Running back|Back]]\n|'''B'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Center (American football)|Center]]\n|'''C'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Cornerback]]\n|'''CB'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Defensive back]]\n|'''DB'''\n|-\n|[[Defensive end]]\n|'''DE'''\n|[[Defensive lineman]]\n|'''DL'''\n|[[Defensive tackle]]\n|'''DT'''\n|[[End (American football)|End]]\n|'''E'''\n|-\n|[[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]]\n|'''FB'''\n|[[Guard (American football)|Guard]]\n|'''G'''\n|[[Halfback (American football)|Halfback]]\n|'''HB'''\n|[[Placekicker|Kicker]]\n|'''K'''\n|-\n|[[Kickoff returner]]\n|'''KR'''\n|[[Offensive tackle]]\n|'''OT'''\n|[[Lineman (American football)|Offensive lineman]]\n|'''OL'''\n|[[Linebacker]]\n|'''LB'''\n|-\n|[[Long snapper]]\n|'''LS'''\n|[[Punter (American football)|Punter]]\n|'''P'''\n|[[Punt returner]]\n|'''PR'''\n|[[Quarterback]]\n|'''QB'''\n|-\n|[[Running back]]\n|'''RB'''\n|[[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|Safety]]\n|'''S'''\n|[[Tight end]]\n|'''TE'''\n|[[Wide receiver]]\n|'''WR'''\n|}\n\n===Offseason departures===\nSeven Alabama players with remaining eligibility declared early for the [[2019 NFL Draft]].

This was the Crimson Tide's 125th overall season, 86th as a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), and 28th within the SEC's [[Southeastern Conference#Current members|Western Division]]. They played their home games at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and were led by 13th-year head coach [[Nick Saban]].\n\nThe defending national runners-up, Alabama began the season ranked second in the AP Poll, and were the favorites to repeat as SEC Champions. The Crimson Tide won their first seven games of the year handily, and rose to first in the AP Poll, but were ranked third in the first [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the year heading into an anticipated match-up against second-ranked [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which Alabama lost 46\u201341. The next week, Alabama lost starting quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]] to a season-ending hip injury in the game against [[2019 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. They finished the regular season with a 48\u201345 loss to rival [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]].\n\nWith a regular season record of 10\u20132, Alabama was not selected for the [[College Football Playoff]] for the first time since the inception of the format in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. While the Crimson Tide were not invited to a [[New Year's Six]] bowl game, they defeated [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]].\n\nQuarterback Tua Tagovailoa, at the time of his injury, was considered a candidate for the Heisman Trophy and was on pace to break his own NCAA FBS passer rating record. He was replaced by backup [[Mac Jones]] for the remainder of the season. Running back [[Najee Harris]] led the team with 1,224 rushing yards and 20 total touchdowns, tied for the SEC lead. Receivers [[Jerry Jeudy]] and [[Devonta Smith]] were both named All-SEC. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference players linebacker [[Anfernee Jennings]] and safety [[Xavier McKinney]].\n\n==Previous season==\nIn [[2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2018]], Alabama went undefeated in the regular season and won the [[2018 SEC Championship Game]] over [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. The Crimson Tide entered the [[College Football Playoff]] as the number one seed, winning the semi-final played at the [[2018 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] over [[2018 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] before falling to [[2018 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship]].\n\n==Offseason==\n===Position key===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Running back|Back]]\n|'''B'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Center (American football)|Center]]\n|'''C'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Cornerback]]\n|'''CB'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Defensive back]]\n|'''DB'''\n|-\n|[[Defensive end]]\n|'''DE'''\n|[[Defensive lineman]]\n|'''DL'''\n|[[Defensive tackle]]\n|'''DT'''\n|[[End (American football)|End]]\n|'''E'''\n|-\n|[[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]]\n|'''FB'''\n|[[Guard (American football)|Guard]]\n|'''G'''\n|[[Halfback (American football)|Halfback]]\n|'''HB'''\n|[[Placekicker|Kicker]]\n|'''K'''\n|-\n|[[Kickoff returner]]\n|'''KR'''\n|[[Offensive tackle]]\n|'''OT'''\n|[[Lineman (American football)|Offensive lineman]]\n|'''OL'''\n|[[Linebacker]]\n|'''LB'''\n|-\n|[[Long snapper]]\n|'''LS'''\n|[[Punter (American football)|Punter]]\n|'''P'''\n|[[Punt returner]]\n|'''PR'''\n|[[Quarterback]]\n|'''QB'''\n|-\n|[[Running back]]\n|'''RB'''\n|[[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|Safety]]\n|'''S'''\n|[[Tight end]]\n|'''TE'''\n|[[Wide receiver]]\n|'''WR'''\n|}\n\n===Offseason departures===\nSeven Alabama players with remaining eligibility declared early for the [[2019 NFL Draft]].

The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nComputer networking may be considered a branch of [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n\nA computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, [[online chat]], telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. [[Distributed computing]] uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n\nA computer network may be used by [[security hacker]]s to deploy [[computer virus]]es or [[computer worm]]s on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [[denial-of-service attack]].\n\n== Network packet ==\n{{Main|Network packet}}\nComputer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [[Point-to-point link|point-to-point telecommunication links]], simply transmit data as a [[bit stream]]. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in ''packets''. A network packet is a formatted unit of [[data]] (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [[packet-switched network]]. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. A longer message is packetized before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are then reassembled back into their original message.\n\nPackets consist of two kinds of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination [[network address]]es, [[error detection]] codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [[Header (computing)|packet headers]] and [[Trailer (computing)|trailers]], with [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] in between.\n\nWith packets, the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [[circuit switching|circuit switched]]. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is [[message queue|queued]] and waits until a link is free.\n\n== Network topology ==\n[[File:NetworkTopologies.svg|thumb|right|Common network topologies]]\n{{Main|Network topology}}\n\nThe physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n\nNetwork topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n\nCommon layouts are:\n* A [[bus network]]: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [[Ethernet]], called [[10BASE5]] and [[10BASE2]]. This is still a common topology on the [[data link layer]], although modern [[physical layer]] variants use [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links instead.\n* A [[star network]]: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [[Wireless LAN]], where each wireless client connects to the central [[Wireless access point]].\n* A [[ring network]]: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) made use of such a topology.\n* A [[mesh network]]: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n* A [[fully connected network]]: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n* A [[tree network]]: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\n\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [[FDDI]], the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n=== Overlay network ===\n[[File:Network Overlay merged.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sample overlay network]]\nAn [[overlay network]] is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [[peer-to-peer]] networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<ref name=over>{{citation |author1=D. Andersen |author2=H. Balakrishnan |author3=M. Kaashoek |author4-link=Robert Tappan Morris |author4=R. Morris |url=http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/papers/ron-sosp2001.html |title=Resilient Overlay Networks |date=October 2001 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\nOverlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using [[modem]]s, before any [[Telecommunications network#Data network|data network]] existed.\n\nThe most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [[telephone network]].<ref name=over /> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [[Address Resolution Protocol|Address resolution]] and [[routing]] are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n\nAnother example of an overlay network is a [[distributed hash table]], which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [[associative array|map]]) indexed by keys.\n\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [[quality of service]] guarantees to achieve higher-quality [[streaming media]]. Previous proposals such as [[IntServ]], [[DiffServ]], and [[IP Multicast]] have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [[Router (computing)|routers]] in the network.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [[Internet service provider]]s.  The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n\nFor example, [[Akamai Technologies]] manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [[multicast]]).

In the [[OSI model]], these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \u2014 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n\nA widely adopted ''family'' of transmission media used in [[local area network]] (LAN) technology is collectively known as [[Ethernet]]. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  [[Wireless LAN]] standards use radio waves, others use [[IrDA|infrared]] signals as a transmission medium. [[Power line communication]] uses a building's [[power cabling]] to transmit data.\n\n=== Wired technologies ===\n[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Bundle of glass threads with light emitting from the ends|[[Fiber optic cables]] are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another]]\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\n*''[[Coaxial cable]]'' is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.{{citation needed|reason=Coax is fundamentally capable of more than this. This must refer to a specific [[Ethernet over coax]] standard, but that's covered in the point below.|date=September 2018}}\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] technology uses existing [[home wiring]] ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cable]], phone lines and [[Power line communication|power lines]]) to create a high-speed local area network.\n*''[[Twisted pair]]'' cabling is used for wired [[Ethernet]] and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic induction]]. The transmission speed ranges from 2&nbsp;Mbit/s to 10&nbsp;Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several [[category cable|category ratings]], designed for use in various scenarios.\n\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|alt=World map with red and blue lines|2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world.]]\n*An ''[[optical fiber]]'' is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and [[Optical amplifier|optical amplifiers]]. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|wave division multiplexing]], optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [[undersea cables]] to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, [[single-mode optical fiber]] (SMF) and [[multi-mode optical fiber]] (MMF).  Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\">{{Cite book |title=CompTIA Network+ exam guide : (exam N10-005) |last=Meyers |first=Mike |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780071789226 |edition=5th |location=New York |oclc=748332969}}</ref>\n\n=== Wireless technologies ===\n[[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black laptop with router in the background |Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links]]\n{{Main|Wireless network}}\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n*''Terrestrial [[microwave]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} apart.\n*''[[Communications satellite]]s''&nbsp;\u2013 Satellites communicate also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit {{convert|35,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n*''[[Cellular network]]s'' use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power [[transceiver]].\n*''Radio and [[spread spectrum]] technologies''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Wireless LAN]]s use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [[IEEE 802.11]] defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [[Wi-Fi]].\n*''[[Free-space optical communication]]'' uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [[line-of-sight propagation]] is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n\n=== Exotic technologies ===\nThere have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media.\n* [[IP over Avian Carriers]] was a humorous April fool's [[Request for Comments]], issued as {{IETF RFC|1149}}. It was implemented in real life in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149 |title=Bergen Linux User Group's CPIP Implementation |publisher=Blug.linux.no |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref>\n* Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the [[Interplanetary Internet]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113053223/http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |title=Interplanetary Internet |publisher=Third Annual International Symposium on Advanced Radio Technologies |author=A.

Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n=== Network interfaces ===\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.]]\nA [[network interface controller]] (NIC) is [[computer hardware]] that connects the computer to the [[network media]] and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n\nIn [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]]\u2014usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Repeaters and hubs ===\nA [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].\n\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an [[Ethernet hub]]. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern [[network switch]]s.\n\n=== Bridges ===\nA [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\nBridges come in three basic types:\n*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs\n*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.\n*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.\n\n=== Switches ===\nA [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html\n|title=Define switch.\n|website=webopedia\n|accessdate=April 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Mitchell |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |title=bridge \u2013 network bridges |website=About.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214940/http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |archive-date=2008-03-28}}</ref> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n\n=== Routers ===\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]\nA [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a \"null\" interface, also known as the \"black hole\" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n\n=== Modems ===\n[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.\n\n== Communication protocols ==\n[[File:Internet layering.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Protocols in relation to the Internet layering scheme.|The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it.]]\n[[File:Message flows and Routing.svg|250px|thumb|alt=When a router is present, message flows go down through protocol layers, across to the router, up the stack inside the router and back down again and is sent on to the final destination where it climbs back up the stack|Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.]]\nA [[communication protocol]] is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a [[protocol stack]] (also see the [[OSI model]]), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is [[HTTP]] (the World Wide Web protocol) running over [[transmission control protocol|TCP]] over [[Internet protocol|IP]] (the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]]) over [[IEEE 802.11]] (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [[wireless router]] and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\n\nCommunication protocols have various characteristics.  They may be [[Connection-oriented communication|connection-oriented]] or [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]], they may use [[circuit mode]] or [[packet switching]], and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\n\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\n\n=== IEEE 802 ===\n[[IEEE 802]] is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [[OSI model]].\n\nFor example, [[Media access control|MAC]] [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [[Spanning Tree Protocol]]. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] describes [[Virtual LAN|VLANs]], and [[IEEE 802.1X]] defines a port-based [[Network Access Control]] protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs)&nbsp;\u2013 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n==== Ethernet ====\n[[Ethernet]], sometimes simply called ''LAN'', is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called [[IEEE 802.3]] published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].\n\n==== Wireless LAN ====\n[[Wireless LAN]], also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the [[IEEE 802]] protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by [[IEEE 802.11]] and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Suite ===\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the [[Internet protocol]] (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.\n\n=== SONET/SDH ===\n[[Synchronous optical networking]] (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [[multiplexing]] protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] voice encoded in [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) frames.\n\n=== Asynchronous Transfer Mode ===\n[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]] and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]]. This differs from other protocols such as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM has similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] and [[Packet switching|packet]] switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nWhile the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [[Next generation network|next-generation networks]], it still plays a role in the [[last mile]], which is the connection between an [[Internet service provider]] and the home user.<ref>For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Thomas|title=Design Principles for DSL-Based Access Solutions|url=http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/~legf/Varios/XDSL_MARTI.PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular standards ===\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), [[cdmaOne]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] (EV-DO), [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT), [[Digital AMPS]] (IS-136/TDMA), and [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network]] (iDEN).<ref>{{cite book |last=Paetsch |first=Michael |year=1993 |title=The evolution of mobile communications in the US and Europe: Regulation, technology, and markets |location=Boston, London |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-8900-6688-1}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic scale ==\n{{Area networks}}\nA network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.\n\n;Nanoscale network\nA [[IEEE P1906.1|nanoscale communication]] network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nanoscale Communication Networks |last=Bush |first=S.

Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci546288,00.html |title=personal area network (PAN) |author=Margaret Rouse |website=TechTarget |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n;Local area network\nA [[local area network]] (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [[node (networking)|node]].  Wired LANs are most likely based on [[Ethernet]] technology.  Newer standards such as [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |title=New global standard for fully networked home |publisher=[[ITU]] |website=ITU-T Newslog |accessdate=2011-11-12 |date=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [[wide area network]] (WAN), include higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data transfer rates]], limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [[leased line]]s to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [[IEEE 802.3]] LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100&nbsp;Gbit/s]], standardized by [[IEEE]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |website=IEEE 802.3 ETHERNET WORKING GROUP |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/ba/ |title=IEEE P802.3ba 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Ethernet Task Force |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Currently, [[Terabit Ethernet|400&nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet]] is being developed.\n\nA LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [[router (computing)|router]].\n\n;Home area network\nA [[home area network]] (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) provider.\n\n;Storage area network\nA [[storage area network]] (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\n\n;Campus area network\nA [[campus area network]] (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [[Category 5 cable|Cat5]] cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\n\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n;Backbone network\nA [[backbone network]] is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.  A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.\n\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone.  When designing a network backbone, [[Network performance management|network performance]] and [[network congestion]] are critical factors to take into account.  Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\n\nAnother example of a backbone network is the [[Internet backbone]], which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between [[Wide area network|wide area networks]]&nbsp;(WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\n;Metropolitan area network\nA [[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.\n\n;Wide area network\nA [[wide area network]] (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.  A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: the physical layer, the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]].\n\n;Enterprise private network\nAn [[enterprise private network]] is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\n\n;Virtual private network\nA [[virtual private network]] (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\nVPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.\n\n;Global area network\nA [[global area network]] (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [[wireless LAN]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |website=IEEE 802.20 \u2014 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |title=IEEE 802.20 Mission and Project Scope |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational scope ==\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the [[Internet]], which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\n\n=== Intranet ===\nAn [[intranet]] is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity.  The intranet uses the [[IP address|IP]] protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.\n\n=== Extranet ===\nAn [[extranet]] is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.  For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers.  These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint.  Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n=== Internetwork ===\nAn [[internetwork]] is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on [http://www.opte.org/maps/ opte.org]. Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two [[IP address]]es. The length of the lines are indicative of the delay between those two nodes. This graph represents less than 30% of the [[Classful network|Class C]] networks reachable.]]\nThe [[Internet]] is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. It is the successor of the [[ARPANET|Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) developed by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the [[optical networking]] backbone to enable the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], video transfer and a broad range of information services.\n\nParticipants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system ([[IP address]]es) administered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] and [[regional Internet registry|address registries]]. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the [[routing|reachability]] of their address spaces through the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n=== Darknet ===\nA [[darknet]] is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers&nbsp;\u2014 sometimes called \"friends\" ([[Friend-to-friend|F2F]])<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mansfield-Devine | first1 = Steve\n| title = Darknets\n| doi = 10.1016/S1361-3723(09)70150-2\n| journal = Computer Fraud & Security\n| volume = 2009\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 4\u20136\n|date=December 2009\n}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 using non-standard [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and [[Port (computer networking)|ports]].\n\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networks as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|sharing]] is anonymous (that is, [[IP addresses]] are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Jessica |title=The Darknet: A Digital Copyright Revolution |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and Technology |year=2010 |volume=16 |issue=4 |url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v16i4/article14.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Routing ==\n[[File:XO classroom network.jpg|thumbnail|Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.]]\n[[Routing]] is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [[circuit switching]] networks and [[packet switched network]]s.\n\nIn packet-switched networks, routing directs [[packet forwarding]] (the transit of logically addressed [[network packet]]s from their source toward their ultimate destination)  through intermediate [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [[Computer storage|memory]], is very important for efficient routing.\n\nThere are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nMost routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] in its assumption that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.\n\n== Network service ==\n[[Network service]]s are applications hosted by [[Server (computing)|servers]] on a computer network, to [[Service (systems architecture)|provide some functionality]] for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]], [[E-mail]],<ref>{{IETF RFC|5321}}, \"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\", J. Klensin (October 2008)</ref> [[printing]] and [[distributed file system|network file sharing]] are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as DNS ([[Domain Name System]]) give names for [[Internet protocol|IP]] and [[MAC address]]es (people remember names like \u201cnm.lan\u201d better than numbers like \u201c210.121.67.18\u201d),<ref name=\"rfc1035\">{{IETF RFC|1035}}, \"Domain names \u2013 Implementation and Specification\", P.

The throughput is affected by technologies such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.\n\n===Network delay===\n{{main|Network delay}}\nAny data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the [[round-trip time]] can have a significant impact on performance.\n\n=== Quality of service ===\nDepending on the installation requirements, [[network performance]] is usually measured by the [[quality of service]] of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [[throughput]], [[jitter]], [[bit error rate]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [[packet-switched network]], viz. ATM:\n\n*Circuit-switched networks: In [[circuit switched]] networks, network performance is synonymous with the [[grade of service]]. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111015452/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |author=ITU-D Study Group 2 |date=June 2006 |title=Teletraffic Engineering Handbook}}</ref> Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\n*ATM: In an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, [[quality of service]] (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.<ref>[http://www.telecommagazine.com/ Telecommunications Magazine Online], Americas January 2003, Issue Highlights, Online Exclusive: Broadband Access Maximum Performance, Retrieved on February 13, 2005.</ref>{{verification needed |date=August 2018}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [[state diagram|state transition diagrams]] are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |title=State Transition Diagrams |accessdate=July 13, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015010139/http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |archivedate=October 15, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Network congestion ===\n[[Network congestion]] occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its [[quality of service]].  Typical effects include [[queueing delay]], [[packet loss]] or the [[blocking probability|blocking]] of new connections.  A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [[offered load]] lead either to only a small increase in network [[throughput]], or to a reduction in network throughput.\n\n[[Network protocol]]s that use aggressive [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmissions]] to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion\u2014even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as ''congestive collapse''.\n\nModern networks use [[congestion control]], [[congestion avoidance]] and [[Network traffic control|traffic control]] techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [[exponential backoff]] in protocols such as [[802.11]]'s [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] and the original [[Ethernet]], [[sliding window|window]] reduction in [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], and [[fair queueing]] in devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [[802.1p]]. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s) [[Local area network]]ing over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\n\nFor the Internet, {{IETF RFC|2914}} addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n=== Network resilience ===\n[[resilience (network)|Network resilience]] is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] in the face of [[Fault (technology)|faults]] and challenges to normal operation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Resilience |publisher=ResiliNets Research Initiative |title=Definitions: Resilience |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Network security ===\n[[Network security]] consists of provisions and policies adopted by the [[network administrator]] to prevent and monitor [[unauthorized]] access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30176-9_41 | last = Simmonds | first = A |author2=Sandilands, P |author3=van Ekert, L|title = An Ontology for Network Security Attack | volume = 3285 | pages = 317\u2013323 | year = 2004 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-23659-7 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6729bfaf5a6f281a660089831f5f3afaa0dd1f64 }}</ref> Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator.

The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\n\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and [[law enforcement]] to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/us-turning-surveillance-society |title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society? |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups\u2014such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\u2014have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and personal freedoms.

It involves the originating party [[encryption|encrypting]] data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [[Internet providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [[confidentiality]] and [[data integrity|integrity]].\n\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include [[HTTPS]] for web traffic, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for [[email]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]] for [[instant messaging]], [[ZRTP]] for [[telephony]], and [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|TETRA]] for radio.\n\nTypical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|clients]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]], not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [[Google Talk]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], [[Facebook]], and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \"end-to-end\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] that subverts negotiation of the [[encryption key]] between the communicating parties, for example [[Skype]] or [[Hushmail]].\n\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [[Exploit (computer security)|technical exploitation]] of [[Client (computing)|clients]], poor quality [[random number generator]]s, or [[key escrow]]. E2EE also does not address [[traffic analysis]], which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n=== SSL/TLS ===\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. [[Netscape Corporation|Netscape]] took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]]. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\"/>\n\n== Views of networks ==\nUsers and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A [[community-of-interest network|community of interest]] has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [[peer-to-peer]] technologies.\n\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network bridge|bridges]] and [[Application-level gateway|application layer gateways]]) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [[subnetwork|subnets]], map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [[Virtual LAN| virtual LAN (VLAN)]] technology.\n\nBoth users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [[intranet]] is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<ref name=\"RFC2547\">{{IETF RFC|2547}}, \"BGP/MPLS VPNs\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999)</ref>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An [[extranet]] is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<ref name=\"RFC2547\" />\n\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [[Internet]] is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered [[IP address]] space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]]. Typically, the [[human-readable]] names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n\nOver the Internet, there can be [[Business-to-business| business-to-business (B2B)]], [[Business-to-consumer| business-to-consumer (B2C)]] and [[Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce|consumer-to-consumer (C2C)]] communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [[communications security]] mechanism.  Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) technology.\n\n== Journals and newsletters ==\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/comp Open Computer Science] ([[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Comparison of network diagram software]]\n*[[Cyberspace]]\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n*[[Information Age]]\n*[[Information revolution]]\n*[[Minimum-Pairs Protocol]]\n*[[Network simulation]]\n*[[Network planning and design]]\n*[[Network traffic control]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Shelly, Gary, et al. \"Discovering Computers\" 2003 Edition.\n* Wendell Odom, Rus Healy, Denise Donohue.

The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nComputer networking may be considered a branch of [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n\nA computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, [[online chat]], telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. [[Distributed computing]] uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n\nA computer network may be used by [[security hacker]]s to deploy [[computer virus]]es or [[computer worm]]s on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [[denial-of-service attack]].\n\n== Network packet ==\n{{Main|Network packet}}\nComputer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [[Point-to-point link|point-to-point telecommunication links]], simply transmit data as a [[bit stream]]. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in ''packets''. A network packet is a formatted unit of [[data]] (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [[packet-switched network]]. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. A longer message is packetized before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are then reassembled back into their original message.\n\nPackets consist of two kinds of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination [[network address]]es, [[error detection]] codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [[Header (computing)|packet headers]] and [[Trailer (computing)|trailers]], with [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] in between.\n\nWith packets, the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [[circuit switching|circuit switched]]. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is [[message queue|queued]] and waits until a link is free.\n\n== Network topology ==\n[[File:NetworkTopologies.svg|thumb|right|Common network topologies]]\n{{Main|Network topology}}\n\nThe physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n\nNetwork topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n\nCommon layouts are:\n* A [[bus network]]: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [[Ethernet]], called [[10BASE5]] and [[10BASE2]]. This is still a common topology on the [[data link layer]], although modern [[physical layer]] variants use [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links instead.\n* A [[star network]]: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [[Wireless LAN]], where each wireless client connects to the central [[Wireless access point]].\n* A [[ring network]]: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) made use of such a topology.\n* A [[mesh network]]: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n* A [[fully connected network]]: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n* A [[tree network]]: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\n\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [[FDDI]], the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n=== Overlay network ===\n[[File:Network Overlay merged.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sample overlay network]]\nAn [[overlay network]] is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [[peer-to-peer]] networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<ref name=over>{{citation |author1=D. Andersen |author2=H. Balakrishnan |author3=M.

The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [[telephone network]].<ref name=over /> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [[Address Resolution Protocol|Address resolution]] and [[routing]] are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n\nAnother example of an overlay network is a [[distributed hash table]], which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [[associative array|map]]) indexed by keys.\n\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [[quality of service]] guarantees to achieve higher-quality [[streaming media]]. Previous proposals such as [[IntServ]], [[DiffServ]], and [[IP Multicast]] have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [[Router (computing)|routers]] in the network.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [[Internet service provider]]s.  The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n\nFor example, [[Akamai Technologies]] manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [[multicast]]).

In the [[OSI model]], these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \u2014 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n\nA widely adopted ''family'' of transmission media used in [[local area network]] (LAN) technology is collectively known as [[Ethernet]]. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  [[Wireless LAN]] standards use radio waves, others use [[IrDA|infrared]] signals as a transmission medium. [[Power line communication]] uses a building's [[power cabling]] to transmit data.\n\n=== Wired technologies ===\n[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Bundle of glass threads with light emitting from the ends|[[Fiber optic cables]] are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another]]\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\n*''[[Coaxial cable]]'' is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.{{citation needed|reason=Coax is fundamentally capable of more than this. This must refer to a specific [[Ethernet over coax]] standard, but that's covered in the point below.|date=September 2018}}\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] technology uses existing [[home wiring]] ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cable]], phone lines and [[Power line communication|power lines]]) to create a high-speed local area network.\n*''[[Twisted pair]]'' cabling is used for wired [[Ethernet]] and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic induction]]. The transmission speed ranges from 2&nbsp;Mbit/s to 10&nbsp;Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several [[category cable|category ratings]], designed for use in various scenarios.\n\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|alt=World map with red and blue lines|2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world.]]\n*An ''[[optical fiber]]'' is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and [[Optical amplifier|optical amplifiers]]. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|wave division multiplexing]], optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [[undersea cables]] to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, [[single-mode optical fiber]] (SMF) and [[multi-mode optical fiber]] (MMF).  Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\">{{Cite book |title=CompTIA Network+ exam guide : (exam N10-005) |last=Meyers |first=Mike |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780071789226 |edition=5th |location=New York |oclc=748332969}}</ref>\n\n=== Wireless technologies ===\n[[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black laptop with router in the background |Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links]]\n{{Main|Wireless network}}\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n*''Terrestrial [[microwave]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} apart.\n*''[[Communications satellite]]s''&nbsp;\u2013 Satellites communicate also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit {{convert|35,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n*''[[Cellular network]]s'' use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power [[transceiver]].\n*''Radio and [[spread spectrum]] technologies''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Wireless LAN]]s use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [[IEEE 802.11]] defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [[Wi-Fi]].\n*''[[Free-space optical communication]]'' uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [[line-of-sight propagation]] is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n\n=== Exotic technologies ===\nThere have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media.\n* [[IP over Avian Carriers]] was a humorous April fool's [[Request for Comments]], issued as {{IETF RFC|1149}}. It was implemented in real life in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149 |title=Bergen Linux User Group's CPIP Implementation |publisher=Blug.linux.no |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref>\n* Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the [[Interplanetary Internet]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113053223/http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |title=Interplanetary Internet |publisher=Third Annual International Symposium on Advanced Radio Technologies |author=A.

Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n=== Network interfaces ===\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.]]\nA [[network interface controller]] (NIC) is [[computer hardware]] that connects the computer to the [[network media]] and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n\nIn [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]]\u2014usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Repeaters and hubs ===\nA [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].\n\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an [[Ethernet hub]]. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern [[network switch]]s.\n\n=== Bridges ===\nA [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\nBridges come in three basic types:\n*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs\n*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.\n*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.\n\n=== Switches ===\nA [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html\n|title=Define switch.\n|website=webopedia\n|accessdate=April 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Mitchell |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |title=bridge \u2013 network bridges |website=About.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214940/http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |archive-date=2008-03-28}}</ref> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n\n=== Routers ===\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]\nA [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a \"null\" interface, also known as the \"black hole\" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n\n=== Modems ===\n[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.\n\n== Communication protocols ==\n[[File:Internet layering.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Protocols in relation to the Internet layering scheme.|The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it.]]\n[[File:Message flows and Routing.svg|250px|thumb|alt=When a router is present, message flows go down through protocol layers, across to the router, up the stack inside the router and back down again and is sent on to the final destination where it climbs back up the stack|Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.]]\nA [[communication protocol]] is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a [[protocol stack]] (also see the [[OSI model]]), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is [[HTTP]] (the World Wide Web protocol) running over [[transmission control protocol|TCP]] over [[Internet protocol|IP]] (the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]]) over [[IEEE 802.11]] (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [[wireless router]] and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\n\nCommunication protocols have various characteristics.  They may be [[Connection-oriented communication|connection-oriented]] or [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]], they may use [[circuit mode]] or [[packet switching]], and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\n\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\n\n=== IEEE 802 ===\n[[IEEE 802]] is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [[OSI model]].\n\nFor example, [[Media access control|MAC]] [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [[Spanning Tree Protocol]]. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] describes [[Virtual LAN|VLANs]], and [[IEEE 802.1X]] defines a port-based [[Network Access Control]] protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs)&nbsp;\u2013 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n==== Ethernet ====\n[[Ethernet]], sometimes simply called ''LAN'', is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called [[IEEE 802.3]] published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].\n\n==== Wireless LAN ====\n[[Wireless LAN]], also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the [[IEEE 802]] protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by [[IEEE 802.11]] and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Suite ===\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the [[Internet protocol]] (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.\n\n=== SONET/SDH ===\n[[Synchronous optical networking]] (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [[multiplexing]] protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] voice encoded in [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) frames.\n\n=== Asynchronous Transfer Mode ===\n[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]] and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]]. This differs from other protocols such as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM has similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] and [[Packet switching|packet]] switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nWhile the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [[Next generation network|next-generation networks]], it still plays a role in the [[last mile]], which is the connection between an [[Internet service provider]] and the home user.<ref>For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Thomas|title=Design Principles for DSL-Based Access Solutions|url=http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/~legf/Varios/XDSL_MARTI.PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular standards ===\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), [[cdmaOne]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] (EV-DO), [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT), [[Digital AMPS]] (IS-136/TDMA), and [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network]] (iDEN).<ref>{{cite book |last=Paetsch |first=Michael |year=1993 |title=The evolution of mobile communications in the US and Europe: Regulation, technology, and markets |location=Boston, London |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-8900-6688-1}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic scale ==\n{{Area networks}}\nA network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.\n\n;Nanoscale network\nA [[IEEE P1906.1|nanoscale communication]] network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nanoscale Communication Networks |last=Bush |first=S.

Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci546288,00.html |title=personal area network (PAN) |author=Margaret Rouse |website=TechTarget |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n;Local area network\nA [[local area network]] (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [[node (networking)|node]].  Wired LANs are most likely based on [[Ethernet]] technology.  Newer standards such as [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |title=New global standard for fully networked home |publisher=[[ITU]] |website=ITU-T Newslog |accessdate=2011-11-12 |date=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [[wide area network]] (WAN), include higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data transfer rates]], limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [[leased line]]s to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [[IEEE 802.3]] LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100&nbsp;Gbit/s]], standardized by [[IEEE]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |website=IEEE 802.3 ETHERNET WORKING GROUP |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/ba/ |title=IEEE P802.3ba 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Ethernet Task Force |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Currently, [[Terabit Ethernet|400&nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet]] is being developed.\n\nA LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [[router (computing)|router]].\n\n;Home area network\nA [[home area network]] (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) provider.\n\n;Storage area network\nA [[storage area network]] (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\n\n;Campus area network\nA [[campus area network]] (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [[Category 5 cable|Cat5]] cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\n\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n;Backbone network\nA [[backbone network]] is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.  A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.\n\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone.  When designing a network backbone, [[Network performance management|network performance]] and [[network congestion]] are critical factors to take into account.  Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\n\nAnother example of a backbone network is the [[Internet backbone]], which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between [[Wide area network|wide area networks]]&nbsp;(WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\n;Metropolitan area network\nA [[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.\n\n;Wide area network\nA [[wide area network]] (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.  A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: the physical layer, the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]].\n\n;Enterprise private network\nAn [[enterprise private network]] is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\n\n;Virtual private network\nA [[virtual private network]] (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\nVPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.\n\n;Global area network\nA [[global area network]] (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [[wireless LAN]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |website=IEEE 802.20 \u2014 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |title=IEEE 802.20 Mission and Project Scope |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational scope ==\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the [[Internet]], which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\n\n=== Intranet ===\nAn [[intranet]] is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity.  The intranet uses the [[IP address|IP]] protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.\n\n=== Extranet ===\nAn [[extranet]] is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.  For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers.  These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint.  Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n=== Internetwork ===\nAn [[internetwork]] is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on [http://www.opte.org/maps/ opte.org]. Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two [[IP address]]es. The length of the lines are indicative of the delay between those two nodes. This graph represents less than 30% of the [[Classful network|Class C]] networks reachable.]]\nThe [[Internet]] is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. It is the successor of the [[ARPANET|Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) developed by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the [[optical networking]] backbone to enable the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], video transfer and a broad range of information services.\n\nParticipants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system ([[IP address]]es) administered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] and [[regional Internet registry|address registries]]. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the [[routing|reachability]] of their address spaces through the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n=== Darknet ===\nA [[darknet]] is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers&nbsp;\u2014 sometimes called \"friends\" ([[Friend-to-friend|F2F]])<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mansfield-Devine | first1 = Steve\n| title = Darknets\n| doi = 10.1016/S1361-3723(09)70150-2\n| journal = Computer Fraud & Security\n| volume = 2009\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 4\u20136\n|date=December 2009\n}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 using non-standard [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and [[Port (computer networking)|ports]].\n\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networks as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|sharing]] is anonymous (that is, [[IP addresses]] are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Jessica |title=The Darknet: A Digital Copyright Revolution |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and Technology |year=2010 |volume=16 |issue=4 |url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v16i4/article14.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Routing ==\n[[File:XO classroom network.jpg|thumbnail|Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.]]\n[[Routing]] is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [[circuit switching]] networks and [[packet switched network]]s.\n\nIn packet-switched networks, routing directs [[packet forwarding]] (the transit of logically addressed [[network packet]]s from their source toward their ultimate destination)  through intermediate [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [[Computer storage|memory]], is very important for efficient routing.\n\nThere are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nMost routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] in its assumption that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.\n\n== Network service ==\n[[Network service]]s are applications hosted by [[Server (computing)|servers]] on a computer network, to [[Service (systems architecture)|provide some functionality]] for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]], [[E-mail]],<ref>{{IETF RFC|5321}}, \"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\", J. Klensin (October 2008)</ref> [[printing]] and [[distributed file system|network file sharing]] are examples of well-known network services.

The throughput is affected by technologies such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.\n\n===Network delay===\n{{main|Network delay}}\nAny data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the [[round-trip time]] can have a significant impact on performance.\n\n=== Quality of service ===\nDepending on the installation requirements, [[network performance]] is usually measured by the [[quality of service]] of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [[throughput]], [[jitter]], [[bit error rate]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [[packet-switched network]], viz. ATM:\n\n*Circuit-switched networks: In [[circuit switched]] networks, network performance is synonymous with the [[grade of service]]. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111015452/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |author=ITU-D Study Group 2 |date=June 2006 |title=Teletraffic Engineering Handbook}}</ref> Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\n*ATM: In an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, [[quality of service]] (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.<ref>[http://www.telecommagazine.com/ Telecommunications Magazine Online], Americas January 2003, Issue Highlights, Online Exclusive: Broadband Access Maximum Performance, Retrieved on February 13, 2005.</ref>{{verification needed |date=August 2018}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [[state diagram|state transition diagrams]] are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |title=State Transition Diagrams |accessdate=July 13, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015010139/http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |archivedate=October 15, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Network congestion ===\n[[Network congestion]] occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its [[quality of service]].  Typical effects include [[queueing delay]], [[packet loss]] or the [[blocking probability|blocking]] of new connections.  A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [[offered load]] lead either to only a small increase in network [[throughput]], or to a reduction in network throughput.\n\n[[Network protocol]]s that use aggressive [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmissions]] to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion\u2014even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as ''congestive collapse''.\n\nModern networks use [[congestion control]], [[congestion avoidance]] and [[Network traffic control|traffic control]] techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [[exponential backoff]] in protocols such as [[802.11]]'s [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] and the original [[Ethernet]], [[sliding window|window]] reduction in [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], and [[fair queueing]] in devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [[802.1p]]. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s) [[Local area network]]ing over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\n\nFor the Internet, {{IETF RFC|2914}} addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n=== Network resilience ===\n[[resilience (network)|Network resilience]] is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] in the face of [[Fault (technology)|faults]] and challenges to normal operation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Resilience |publisher=ResiliNets Research Initiative |title=Definitions: Resilience |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Network security ===\n[[Network security]] consists of provisions and policies adopted by the [[network administrator]] to prevent and monitor [[unauthorized]] access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30176-9_41 | last = Simmonds | first = A |author2=Sandilands, P |author3=van Ekert, L|title = An Ontology for Network Security Attack | volume = 3285 | pages = 317\u2013323 | year = 2004 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-23659-7 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6729bfaf5a6f281a660089831f5f3afaa0dd1f64 }}</ref> Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.  Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.\n\n=== Network surveillance ===\n[[Network surveillance]] is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the [[Internet]]. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\n\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and [[law enforcement]] to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/us-turning-surveillance-society |title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society? |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups\u2014such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\u2014have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and personal freedoms.

It involves the originating party [[encryption|encrypting]] data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [[Internet providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [[confidentiality]] and [[data integrity|integrity]].\n\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include [[HTTPS]] for web traffic, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for [[email]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]] for [[instant messaging]], [[ZRTP]] for [[telephony]], and [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|TETRA]] for radio.\n\nTypical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|clients]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]], not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [[Google Talk]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], [[Facebook]], and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \"end-to-end\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] that subverts negotiation of the [[encryption key]] between the communicating parties, for example [[Skype]] or [[Hushmail]].\n\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [[Exploit (computer security)|technical exploitation]] of [[Client (computing)|clients]], poor quality [[random number generator]]s, or [[key escrow]]. E2EE also does not address [[traffic analysis]], which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n=== SSL/TLS ===\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. [[Netscape Corporation|Netscape]] took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]]. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\"/>\n\n== Views of networks ==\nUsers and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A [[community-of-interest network|community of interest]] has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [[peer-to-peer]] technologies.\n\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network bridge|bridges]] and [[Application-level gateway|application layer gateways]]) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [[subnetwork|subnets]], map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [[Virtual LAN| virtual LAN (VLAN)]] technology.\n\nBoth users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [[intranet]] is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<ref name=\"RFC2547\">{{IETF RFC|2547}}, \"BGP/MPLS VPNs\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999)</ref>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An [[extranet]] is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<ref name=\"RFC2547\" />\n\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [[Internet]] is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered [[IP address]] space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]]. Typically, the [[human-readable]] names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n\nOver the Internet, there can be [[Business-to-business| business-to-business (B2B)]], [[Business-to-consumer| business-to-consumer (B2C)]] and [[Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce|consumer-to-consumer (C2C)]] communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [[communications security]] mechanism.  Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) technology.\n\n== Journals and newsletters ==\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/comp Open Computer Science] ([[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Comparison of network diagram software]]\n*[[Cyberspace]]\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n*[[Information Age]]\n*[[Information revolution]]\n*[[Minimum-Pairs Protocol]]\n*[[Network simulation]]\n*[[Network planning and design]]\n*[[Network traffic control]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Shelly, Gary, et al. \"Discovering Computers\" 2003 Edition.\n* Wendell Odom, Rus Healy, Denise Donohue.

For example, verses 2.51-2.56, recommend that a monk must go on his begging round, collect alms food and present it to his teacher first, then eat. One should revere whatever food one gets and eat it without disdain, states Manusmriti, but never overeat, as eating too much harms health.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 97</ref> In verse 5.47, the text states that work becomes without effort when a man contemplates, undertakes and does what he loves to do and when he does so without harming any creature.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 140</ref>\n\nNumerous verses relate to the practice of meat eating, how it causes injury to living beings, why it is evil, and the morality of vegetarianism.<ref name=olivellepage31/> Yet, the text balances its moral tone as an appeal to one's conscience, states Olivelle. For example, verse 5.56 as translated by Olivelle states, \"there is no fault in eating meat, in drinking liquor, or in having sex; that is the natural activity of creatures. Abstaining from such activity, however, brings greatest rewards.\"<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 31-32, 138-147, 558-593</ref>\n\n===On rights of women===\nManusmriti offers an inconsistent and internally conflicting perspective on women's rights.<ref name=flavia/> The text, for example, declares that a marriage cannot be dissolved by a woman or a man, in verse 8.101-8.102.<ref>Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520018983}}, page 84</ref> Yet, the text, in other sections, allows either to dissolve the marriage.

The codification of complex and interdependent traditional systems froze certain aspects of the status of women, for instance, outside the context of constantly evolving social and economic relations, which in effect limited or restricted women's rights. The selectivity of the process, whereby colonial authorities sought the assistance of Hindu and Muslim religious elites in understanding the law, resulted in the Brahminization and Islamization of customary laws [in British India].

For example, verses 2.51-2.56, recommend that a monk must go on his begging round, collect alms food and present it to his teacher first, then eat. One should revere whatever food one gets and eat it without disdain, states Manusmriti, but never overeat, as eating too much harms health.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 97</ref> In verse 5.47, the text states that work becomes without effort when a man contemplates, undertakes and does what he loves to do and when he does so without harming any creature.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 140</ref>\n\nNumerous verses relate to the practice of meat eating, how it causes injury to living beings, why it is evil, and the morality of vegetarianism.<ref name=olivellepage31/> Yet, the text balances its moral tone as an appeal to one's conscience, states Olivelle. For example, verse 5.56 as translated by Olivelle states, \"there is no fault in eating meat, in drinking liquor, or in having sex; that is the natural activity of creatures. Abstaining from such activity, however, brings greatest rewards.\"<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 31-32, 138-147, 558-593</ref>\n\n===On rights of women===\nManusmriti offers an inconsistent and internally conflicting perspective on women's rights.<ref name=flavia/> The text, for example, declares that a marriage cannot be dissolved by a woman or a man, in verse 8.101-8.102.<ref>Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520018983}}, page 84</ref> Yet, the text, in other sections, allows either to dissolve the marriage. For example, verses 9.72-9.81 allow the man or the woman to get out of a fraudulent marriage or an abusive marriage, and remarry; the text also provides legal means for a woman to remarry when her husband has been missing or has abandoned her.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 190-207, 746-809</ref>\n\nIt preaches [[chastity]] to [[widow]]s such as in verses 5.158-5.160, opposes a woman marrying someone outside her own social class as in verses 3.13-3.14.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 31-32, 108-123, 138-147</ref> In other verses, such as 2.67-2.69 and 5.148-5.155, Manusmriti preaches that as a girl, she should obey and seek protection of her father, as a young woman her husband, and as a widow her son; and that a woman should always worship her husband as a god.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 98, 146-147</ref> In verses 3.55-3.56, Manusmriti also declares that \"women must be honored and adorned\", and \"where women are revered, there the gods rejoice; but where they are not, no sacred rite bears any fruit\".<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 111</ref><ref>Sanskrit: \u092f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0928\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0942\u091c\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0930\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0964 \u092f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0924\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0928 \u092a\u0942\u091c\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092b\u0932\u093e\u0903 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0903 <br />[https://archive.org/stream/lawsofman00manu#page/n227/mode/2up The Laws of Manu 3.55-3.56] George B\u00fchler (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 25, Oxford University Press, page 85</ref> Elsewhere, in verses 5.147-5.148, states Olivelle, the text declares, \"a woman must never seek to live independently\".<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 146</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, states Olivelle, the text presupposes numerous practices such a marriages outside varna, such as between a Brahmin man and a Shudra woman in verses 9.149-9.157, a widow getting pregnant with a child of a man she is not married to in verses 9.57-9.62, marriage where a woman in love elopes with her man, and then grants legal rights in these cases such as property inheritance rights in verses 9.143-9.157, and the legal rights of the children so born.<ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 31-32, 194-207, 755-809</ref> The text also presumes that a married woman may get pregnant by a man other than her husband, and dedicates verses 8.31-8.56 to conclude that the child's custody belongs to the woman and her legal husband, and not to the man she got pregnant with.<ref>Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520018983}}, pages 83-84</ref><ref>Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 182-193, 659-706</ref>\n\nManusmriti provides a woman with property rights to six types of property in verses 9.192-9.200.

(...) All the editions of the ''MDh'', except for Jolly's, reproduce the text as found in the [Calcutta] manuscript containing the commentary of Kulluka. I have called this as the \"[[vulgate]] version\".  It was Kulluka's version that has been translated repeatedly: Jones (1794), Burnell (1884), Buhler (1886) and [[Wendy Doniger|Doniger]] (1991). (...)\n\nThe belief in the authenticity of Kulluka's text was openly articulated by Burnell (1884, xxix): \"There is then no doubt that the textus receptus, viz., that of Kulluka Bhatta, as adopted in India and by European scholars, is very near on the whole to the original text.\" This is far from the truth.

The codification of complex and interdependent traditional systems froze certain aspects of the status of women, for instance, outside the context of constantly evolving social and economic relations, which in effect limited or restricted women's rights. The selectivity of the process, whereby colonial authorities sought the assistance of Hindu and Muslim religious elites in understanding the law, resulted in the Brahminization and Islamization of customary laws [in British India]. For example, the British orientalist scholar William Jones translated the key texts ''Al Sirjjiyah'' in 1792 as the Mohammedan Law of Inheritance, and '''Manusmriti''' in 1794 as the ''Institutes of Hindu Law or the Ordinances of Manu''. In short, British colonial administrators reduced centuries of vigorous development of total ethical, religious and social systems to fit their own preconceived European notions of what Muslim and Hindu \"law\" should be.\n|[[Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im]]|Islam and the Secular State: Negotiating the Future of Sharia<ref name=annaim/>}}\n\n===Outside India===\nThe ''Dharma-sastras'', particularly Manusmriti, states Anthony Reid,<ref name=reidseasia/> were \"greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of the natural order, which kings were obliged to uphold.

The game typically involves the [[National Football League]], [[Canadian Football League]], or [[college football]].\n\nThere are two main types of fantasy football:\n* Traditional in which the competition can run either for an entire [[season (sports)|season]] or many seasons if it is a keeper league, \n* [[Daily fantasy sports|Daily]] is an accelerated version in which the contests are conducted over shorter periods, such as a week or a single day. Daily fantasy football is managed by commercial internet companies who charge a percentage of each [[betting pool]]. In the United States, the two largest firms are [[FanDuel]] and [[DraftKings]].\n\n==History==\nModern fantasy football can be traced back to the late Wilfred \"Bill the Gill\" Winkenbach, an [[Oakland, California]] businessman and a limited partner in the [[Oakland Raiders]]. In a [[New York City]] hotel room during a 1962 Raiders cross-country trip, Winkenbach, along with Raiders Public Relations man Bill Tunnel and Tribune reporter [[Scotty Stirling]], developed a system of organization and a rule book, which would eventually be the basis of modern fantasy football.\n\nThe inaugural league was called the GOPPPL (Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League), and the first draft took place in the [[Recreation room|rumpus room]] of Winkenbach's home in [[Oakland, California]] in August 1963.<ref>{{cite web| title=Fantasy Football 101| first=Michael| last=Fabiano| date=November 18, 2008| publisher=[[National Football League]]| url=http://www.nfl.com/fantasy/story/09000d5d80021ece/article/fantasy-football-101| accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref> The league consisted of eight members, made up of administrative affiliates of the AFL, pro football journalists, or someone who had purchased or sold 10 season tickets for the Raiders\u2019 1963 season. Each roster consisted of the following in the GOPPPL: two quarterbacks, four halfbacks, two fullbacks, four offensive ends, two kick/punt returners, two field goal kickers, two defensive backs/linebackers and two defensive linemen. The current GOPPPL roster now includes two quarterbacks, four halfbacks, six wide receivers/tight ends, two kickers, two defensive backs, one return team, and a bonus pick for any position. As of 2012, the GOPPPL celebrated its 50th season and it still maintains its touchdown-only scoring heritage.\n\nIn 1969, Andy Mousalimas, an original creator of GOPPPL and participant in the inaugural draft, brought the game to his sports bar, the King's X in Oakland where he added another couple of leagues. When the patrons of other Oakland and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] bars visited for trivia contests they soon learned of fantasy football and passed the word about it.<ref>{{cite web|title=BIRTH OF FANTASY FOOTBALL|url=http://www.oulala.com/en/birth-of-fantasy-football|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> Due to the time-consuming nature of the game's scoring it was difficult to pick up and spread slowly across the country.\n\nThe Indoor Football League (IFL) began in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in the fall of 1980 by a group of six students at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-herald.com/sports/20160821/fantasy-football-league-originated-in-northest-ohio-entering-36th-season|title=Fantasy football league originated in Northeast Ohio entering 36th season|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Charter members Tom Spear and Jeff Kornreich came up with the idea of forming a league after reading a short article by Glenn Ferry in the September 1980 issue of Inside Sports magazine.<ref>Ferry, Glenn (30 September 1980).  \u201cRunning Your Own Football Franchise for Fun and Profit\u201d.

Between 1985 and 1996, The Grandstand continued to improve on the game and the technology by being the first to offer automated drafting, real-time scoring, real-time trading and transactions, and continuous leagues.<ref>Founder of The Grandstand, Ken Schoenberg</ref>\n\nThe first national fantasy football competition, Pigskin Playoff, was developed in 1989 by Lee Marc, Robert Barbiere, and Brad Wendkos of Phoneworks who teamed with a West Coast Ad Agency (Wakeman & deForest) to launch the game in 1990 in a number of newspapers throughout the country including the Detroit Free Press, Los Angeles Times, Arizona Republic, Press Democrat. Archives of Pigskin Playoff are available online and in most public libraries.<ref>\"Pigskin Playoff\", Detroit Free Press, 9/4/1990 - Page 24; Los Angeles Times, 9/9/1990 - Page 118; and others as displayed in archives of www.newspapers.com</ref> Pigskin Playoff is what current Daily Fantasy Sports are modeled after in that it was the first game to allow significantly large numbers of participants to compete against one another for prizes and more importantly converted football statistics into a simple scoring system. Participants created a team of NFL players, earned stats for those players based on actual performance, traded those players on a daily basis, and accrued points in an effort to compete against one another to win prizes. The group filed and was awarded US Patents 5,018,736A and 5,263,723A, for Interactive Game System and Method; Interactive Contest System.<ref>United States Patent Office (USPTO) www.uspto.gov</ref>\n\nIn 1997, [[CBS]] launched the beta version of the first publicly available free fantasy football website.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The game immediately became widely popular. Within three years, all major sports media websites launched competing for fantasy football hosting websites. The NFL released their own official game in 2010, NFL.com Fantasy Football, further driving industry growth. Fantasy football is now the single most important marketing tool for the NFL. Today, it is estimated over 19 million people compete in public and private leagues online nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/20629828/|title=Homepage|author=|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=|access-date=August 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603015406/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/20629828/|archive-date=June 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, a fantasy football-based sitcom, ''[[The League]]'', was created by the husband-and-wife team of [[Jeff Schaffer]] (''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'') and [[Jackie Marcus Schaffer]] (''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]'', ''[[EuroTrip]]''), who served as executive producers and directors.

The two most popular league types are head-to-head and total points leagues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/types-of-fantasy-football-leagues-1335391|title=From Standard to Keeper: 6 Types of Fantasy Football Leagues|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n* <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://football.about.com/od/fantasygames/a/fantasyleagues.htm|title=From Standard to Keeper: 6 Types of Fantasy Football Leagues|newspaper=About.com Sports|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> In '''head-to-head leagues''', a fantasy team matches up against a different fantasy team from the league each week. The team that receives the most points of the two receives a win for that week. Points are dictated by the scoring system that is either standard set by the website or custom set by the league. A team's total is the sum of all players' points who were placed in a starting slot by the team owner for the day they were playing (as opposed to being on the bench, in which any points gained would not count). Teams with the best win-loss record advance to the playoffs. If two teams have the same record, tiebreakers are employed based on league preference.\n* '''Total points leagues''' are leagues in which teams accumulate points on an ongoing basis. The league standings are determined by the teams\u2019 total points. The most popular total points leagues are \"best-ball\" leagues, where the week-to-week roster management is removed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/yahoo-best-ball-is-here-101-guide-on-how-to-play-this-lowmaintenance-fantasy-game-221809010.html|title=Yahoo Best Ball is here: 101 guide on how to play this low-maintenance fantasy game|website=sports.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> Playoff leagues are also frequently total points leagues. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/nfl-playoff-fantasy-leagues/|title=NFL Playoff Fantasy Leagues|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n* '''All play leagues''' are leagues in which all teams play each other each week. For example, if there are 14 teams in the league, the top scoring team that week would post a 13\u20130 record, 2nd highest scoring team would post a 12\u20131 record and so on.\n* A '''Keeper style league''' allows teams to keep a set number of players from one year to the next and sometimes assign them contracts. In the first season of a keeper league, the draft is performed the same as any other standard league draft would be performed. In a keeper league you cut your roster limit to a certain number each offseason. Keeper leagues can keep as few as 1 or as many as even 16 or more in deeper keeper leagues. If your roster limit is cut down in the offseason, it's a keeper league as opposed to a dynasty league where you maintain your entire roster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dummies.com/sports/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/fantasy-football-keeper-leagues/|title=Fantasy Football Keeper Leagues|website=dummies|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n* A '''Salary cap league''' is a particular type of fantasy league which adds another factor of realism similar to the NFL: the salary cap. Each player has an associated salary and the total spent on all the players on a team has a maximum - the \"salary cap.\"\n* In '''Auction leagues''', a team is composed of players who are bought auction-style during the draft, as opposed to using traditional snake drafts that are common in fantasy football. Each team is given a budget to bid on players. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/fantasy-football-auction-drafts/|title=Fantasy Football Auction Drafts|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n* In '''Dynasty leagues''', a team keeps all players from year to year and replenishes rosters through rookie drafts. Dynasty leagues are enhanced versions of keeper leagues. In dynasty leagues, your roster limit is unchanged in the offseason, or increases temporarily to allow the addition of rookies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/dynasty-fantasy-football-leagues/|title=Dynasty Fantasy Football Leagues|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n* In '''Two-quarterback leagues''', a team has the ability to start two quarterbacks in their weekly lineup.  This changes the value of the quarterback position, as it doubles the number of quarterbacks able to start in any given week. However, in any fantasy football format, the number of quarterbacks who can start is determined by the league commissioner.\n* In '''Empire leagues''', teams compete in a dynasty-format and prizes are offered for league winners. A special side-pot is created from entry fees each year. Once an owner wins the league two years in a row, the Empire pot goes to that owner, and the league starts over.\n* '''SuperFlex Leagues''' are leagues in which teams can start a QB in the flex position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/ppr-scoring/|title=PPR Scoring|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> Generally, a superflex position is added in addition to traditional roster spots such as a flex position. Often, defenses and kickers are removed from these league formats.\n* '''IDP or Individual Defensive Player leagues''' are leagues where teams draft individual defensive players in addition to offensive players, as opposed to drafting an NFL team's defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monksidpweeknflfantasyfootball.com/play-idp-fantasy-football-nfl-individual-defensive-player-leagues|title=How to Play IDP Fantasy Football - NFL Individual Defensive Player Leagues|author=|date=|website=monksidpweeknflfantasyfootball.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Pirate Leagues''' are leagues where a winning team gets to choose a player from his opponent's roster.\n* '''[[Daily Fantasy Sports|Daily fantasy sports]]''' is like traditional fantasy sports where players draft a team of real-world athletes who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However, instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day (or in the case of NFL, one weekend). Users can play head-to-head or in larger field tournaments. Both cash leagues and free contests are available for play.\n\n==Draft==\nEach season, fantasy football leagues hold a draft (note: in dynasty leagues, this normally consists of NFL rookies only), where each team drafts NFL players. These players are kept unless they are traded or dropped, whereby they enter a pool of unowned players that any team may claim. In most leagues, no player may be owned by more than one team, although some leagues do allow for this.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abshier|first=Adam|title=THE FUNDAMENTALS OF A LIVE FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT|url=http://www.dummies.com/sports/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/the-fundamentals-of-a-live-fantasy-football-draft/|work=Dummies|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> There are essentially two types of drafts. In a traditional \"serpentine\" or \"snake\" draft, owners take turns drafting players in a \"snake\" method, i.e. the owner who picks first in the odd rounds picks last in the even rounds, in the interests of fairness. If these rules are confusing at all be sure to reach out to 'AVG fantasy football\" on Instagram or YouTube and they will be able to answer any fantasy football questions you might have.\n\nIn an auction draft, each owner has an imaginary budget which he must use to purchase all his players in an auction format. Owners take turns nominating players for open bid. The owner who bids the highest on each player receives that player, reducing their remaining budget accordingly. Auction drafts are viewed as the more fair method since every owner begins on equal ground.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ludwig|first=Eric|title=Auction Drafts for Beginners|url=https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/articles/auction-drafts-beginners/|work=The Fantasy Footballers|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> A few leagues use a hybrid of the two styles, selecting a portion of their roster via auction, with the remainder selected through a serpentine method.\n\nThe most commonly used strategies are value-based drafting and opinion-based drafting. Value-based drafting entails projecting the total fantasy point value for each player in the draft and then figuring their value with respect to other players at their position, while standard opinion-based drafting requires ranking each player based on your opinion of worth or other people's opinion of said player's worth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gresham|first=Chet|title=Fantasy Football Draft Strategy: Evaluating Value Based Drafting|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1242943-fantasy-football-draft-strategy-evaluating-value-based-drafting|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nDrafts can be conducted in \"live\" or \"auto\" formats. Live drafts involve players utilizing real-time strategy and reactionary measures to acquire specific available players. Auto-drafts use preliminary draft rankings set by each team to automate the draft cycle and establish the teams. Live drafts are often preferred to automated as they are believed to require more skill.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hockensmith|first=Dustin|title=Fantasy football mailbag: Auto-draft strategy and where to rank quarterbacks|url=http://www.pennlive.com/fantasy_football/2014/09/fantasy_football_mailbag_auto-.html|work=PA Live|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe location of fantasy football drafts depends on the geographic location of each team manager. With the rise of the internet, all fantasy football providers have made online drafting an option for leagues in which the managers are too far away to meet up in person. Other leagues make a tradition of meeting up to draft, and in some leagues, managers travel cross-country to attend annual league drafts. Group drafts conducted in-person are typically scheduled many weeks in advance. Common locations include boardrooms, offices, bars, or dining establishments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gelhar|first=Alex|title=How to play fantasy football: A beginner's guide|work=NFL}}</ref> Once the league is full with team owners, the order of the draft numbers should be initiated by either a random in-person or computer-based draft order, or, in a keeper or dynasty league, the draft order runs in reverse order of the previous year's standings.\n\nLastly, another addition that the ESPN fantasy football creators should incorporate in their next update include; live draft trades either for players or additional draft picks. Multiple draft picks can be traded for a player or a player can be traded for draft picks. Draft picks can also be traded for more additional draft picks.\n\n== Team rosters ==\nEach team is allowed a predetermined number of players on its roster, as well as a specified number at each position that can or must be used in each game (the \"starters\"). Owners for each team then determine each week which players will start (within the rules) and which will be \"benched\". Just like in real football, bench players can become starters for various reasons: due to other players' injury, poor performance, or if another player's team has a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] that week.\n\nEach week, owners choose their starters for a game before a certain deadline. Whether to sit or start a player is usually based on strategic considerations including the player's past and expected performance, defensive matchups, the team he is playing that week and so on.\n\n=== Starters ===\nEach team owner must designate which players from the team roster will be starters each week - i.e. the only players who will \"score\" any points. The following example is similar to many common formats required for a starting lineup:\n* 1 [[Quarterback]] (QB)\n* 2 [[Running Back]]s (RB)\n* 2 [[Wide Receiver]]s (WR)\n* 1 Flex (choose from RB/WR/TEs) \n* 1 [[Tight End]] (TE)\n* 1 [[Placekicker]] (K)\n* 1 Team Defense/Special Teams (D/ST)\n* 6 Bench (BN)\nThere are many variants on this. Some leagues use individual defensive players (IDPs) (and in some cases a punter) instead of or in addition to a combined Team Defense/Special Teams. Some other leagues use separate Defense and Special Teams. Another variant is the \"flex\" position, which can be filled by a player in one of several positions. Flex positions are often limited to \"WR/TE\", \"RB/WR\", or \"RB/WR/TE\". Traditionally, this flex was required to be an RB, WR, or TE; however, some leagues allow any position to fill this flex slot as an \"OP\" (any player who plays a position on offense) or \"superflex\". Some leagues also have a two-quarterback requirement for a starting lineup, providing yet another twist into the complexity of different scoring systems and lineups.\n\n=== Scoring configurations ===\nLeague managers earn team points based on their ''starting'' players' performances in weekly NFL games. Players accumulate points based purely on their statistical output. For example, a touchdown might be worth six points while each yard passed, rushed, or carried may be worth a certain number of points, and so on. In most cases, players earn points for passing, rushing, and receiving yards.\n\nAlthough kickers can theoretically score points through touchdowns or yards rushed and received, they mainly accumulate most of their points through field goals and extra points. The Team Defense / Special Teams position earns points through defensive plays (such as turnovers, [[quarterback sack]]s, safeties, and blocked kicks) and by limiting the offensive points of the opposing teams.  Also, whereas points are awarded to players for positive plays, points are taken away from players for negative plays such as turnovers or missed kicks.\n\n==== Standard scoring ====\n\nThe standard fantasy football scoring system comprises a well-respected baseline of statistic/point-value pairs designed to promote balance across the various fantasy positions.<ref>{{cite web| last = Perniciaro| first = Brad| authorlink =| title = Standard Fantasy Football Scoring & Points System Guide| website =| publisher = Cheatsheetwarroom.com| date = 2011-04-10| url = http://www.cheatsheetwarroom.com/blog/post/standard-fantasy-football-scoring-system.aspx| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2014-04-22 }}</ref> This is the typical scoring configuration chosen by first time fantasy football commissioners because it is a very basic points system which is fair and intuitive for fantasy novices.\n\nA typical standard scoring format would look very similar to this, although there may be slight discrepancies in points awarded to kickers (depending on the league host's scoring limitations):\n* 1 point for 25 passing yards\n* 1 point for 10 rushing yards\n* 1 point for 10 receiving yards\n* 6 points for a touchdown\n* 4 points for a passing touchdown\n* -2 points for every interception thrown or fumble lost\n* 1 point for each extra point made\n* 3 points for each 0-39 yard field goal, 4 points for each 40-49 yard field goal, and 5 points for each 50+ yard field goal\n* 2 points per turnover gained by defense\n* 1 point per sack by the defense\n* 2 points for a safety by defense\n* 6 points for each touchdown scored by the defense\n* 2 points for each blocked kick<ref>Remember to start the players you think will have the most \"Fantasy Points\".{{cite web| last = Eisenberg| first = Jamey| authorlink = | title = Draft prep: How to start a Fantasy league| website = | publisher = CBSSports.com| date = 2008-07-18| url = http://fantasynews.sportsline.com/fantasyfootball/story/10900399| format = | doi = | access-date = 2008-08-11| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080813121305/http://fantasynews.sportsline.com/fantasyfootball/story/10900399| archive-date = 2008-08-13| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Points-per-reception (PPR) ====\nPoints-per-reception leagues were created as an effort to make wide receivers and tight ends more relevant to fantasy scoring.  In this alternate scoring system, fractional or full points are awarded for every reception tallied by a player.  This changes the value of players in standard scoring systems, as running backs who catch many passes become more valuable, those who catch fewer are less valuable, and so on.  Certain leagues vary the points respective positions earn for receptions. In a survey conducted by [[Apex Fantasy Leagues]], PPR scoring was found to be the most popular scoring system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/fantasy-football-survey-results/|title=Fantasy Football Survey Results|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, [[Yahoo]] adopted a Half-PPR scoring system as the default scoring system for new leagues on their fantasy football platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasypros.com/2018/08/expert-consensus-rankings-vs-yahoo-pre-draft-rankings-2018-fantasy-football/ | title= Expert Consensus Rankings vs. Yahoo!

Many of the original fantasy football leagues were pure-scoring leagues as this provided for easier tracking of team points throughout the season. As the game matured and moved online, it became easier to track yardage and more sophisticated scoring configurations were adopted.\n\n==== Pure yardage leagues ====\n\nAn alternate scoring format is the \"pure yardage\" league, in which touchdowns are ignored, and each player's passing, rushing and receiving yards are totaled. Some yardage leagues also convert defensive stats into yards (ex., 50 yards for an interception, 20 yards for a sack), whether for a team's defense, or individual players.\n\n==== Individual defensive player (IDP) ====\n\nAn alternative method for scoring defense is Individual Defensive Players or IDP fantasy football. The main difference being that players typically draft anywhere from 3 to 7 individual defensive players during a draft as opposed to just one team defense. Sometimes there are required positions to fill like 2 Linebackers, 2 Defensive Backs and 2 Defensive Linemen and sometimes it's just 5 defensive players of any position you choose. There are many different ways to draft IDPs and many have found this makes the later part of the fantasy draft more exciting. For instance, instead of drafting a 5th wide receiver in the 16th round that will typically be on your bench or dropped part way through the season, you are instead drafting a \"full-time\" starting defensive player that can help you win your league.\n\n==== Performance-based bonuses ====\n\nSome leagues allow bonuses to be awarded to players for exceptionally good performances, like a QB throwing for over 300 yards.  Running backs or wide receivers could similarly be awarded a performance bonus based on accumulating more than 100 yards on the ground or through the air.  Kickers could even be awarded for long field goals, generally 50 yards or longer.\n\n====Rollover====\nIn some fantasy football leagues, a player that receives a lot of points in one week may save them to use in a future fantasy game. Specific rules vary from league-to-league. This ruling has many variations, as does the scoring systems of fantasy football leagues, but the ruling that is considered to be \u201cstandard\u201d is defined as follows:\nAny team that scores in excess of 140 points in any one week is eligible for the rollover rule; provided they won the match-up for that week; and with the score of 140 points would have still won the match-up for the week.  If the previous is true then the rollover ruling applies, which states; \u201cany team eligible for the rule may use the points earned in excess of 140 on any future match-up for the remainder of the season\u201d, with the following provisions attached:\nThe team electing to use rollover points must make it publicly known to all other teams, twenty-four hours prior to the kickoff of the first game, that they will be using the points that week; rollover points cannot be used for post-season games; rollover points must be used completely and cannot be broken up over multiple weeks, i.e. if a team has 5 rollover points they must be used on one week, not 1 point per week for five weeks; rollover points must be used in the current season; if rollover points have not been used and a team is eligible for additional from another week the points will be added and can only be used in one week.\n\n===League manager and gambling===\nMany leagues are composed of friends, family, co-workers, and even strangers that are in the fantasy league to prove who is the greatest \"couch coach\". Millions of dollars are won and lost each year in fantasy sports league betting. Some leagues are managed by players in the leagues, while other leagues are run by independent businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|title=The Finances of a Fantasy Football Player|author=Kate Rogers|date=|work=Fox Business|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043455/http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though the traditional fame of the game was for respect and pride within groups,  gambling has gained a more prominent role. The Federal government determined that fantasy league gambling is not a \"game of chance\" and as such is not illegal, however, alterations to the rules can cause a fantasy league to skew too far into chance and lose federal protection. At the state level, including [[Arizona]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], and [[Vermont]] have banned certain activities related to fantasy football, such as the collection of league fees and payout of winnings, when done so online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chakraborty|first=Barnini|title=Gaming laws could pose risk for fantasy football craze|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/31/gaming-laws-pose-risk-for-fantasy-football-craze/|publisher=Newscorp|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Florida has an outright ban on all fantasy football, though how the ban is enforced appears to be unclear.

For example, the last place finisher must get a tattoo, and that tattoo has to be of what the winner of the league wants. The only thing that the loser gets any say in is the location of the tattoo. The owners of the teams have to sign a contract before the season to agree to the punishment if they lose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/09/17/fantasy-football-league-tattoos/|title=The Loser of This Fantasy Football League Gets a Heinous Tattoo|author=Sam Laird|date=18 September 2013|work=Mashable|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>  Other high-stakes leagues offer prizes of US$250,000 to the ultimate champion.\n\n===All individual players===\nThere are several dynasty leagues that follow the NFL's roster model and score all possible NFL players at all individual positions. Offensive linemen (OL) are scored by total yards and points minus sacks given up. Fullbacks are partially scored as offensive linemen because of their blocking duties. Kick and punt returners are scored by yardage and touchdowns. Punters are scored by net average and punts inside the 20-yard line.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association|FSTA]], approximately 41 million people play fantasy sports every year with an average age of 34. 18% of the market is held by teens, an important demographic because more than 80% of all users say they are likely to continue playing for at least the next decade and more than 40% say they will play for life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Industry Demographics|url=http://www.fsta.org/?page=demographics|publisher=FTSA|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> 80% of all team managers are male. 89.8% of them are white and 51.5% are not married. 78% hold a bachelor's degree or higher, likely making the majority of team managers an upper-middle-class earner with a median income between $60\u2013100K.<ref name=\"Krossover\">{{cite web|title=Fantasy Football: The Economics of an American Obsession|url=http://www.krossover.com/blog/2012/08/fantasy-football-the-economics-of-an-american-obsession/|publisher=Krossover|accessdate=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109204942/http://www.krossover.com/blog/2012/08/fantasy-football-the-economics-of-an-american-obsession/|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on American economy==\nThe economic impacts of fantasy football are vast in number and value. Most of the impacts are positive on the economy overall, but there are some relatively minor drawbacks. Growth rates in fantasy football showed no signs of slowing down over the past few years.<ref name=\"Krossover\"/> While team managers are drawn to fantasy football because they can get started and play for free, they are still likely to spend on many of fantasy football's complementary industries.\n\n===Ad revenue===\nOne of the largest sources of revenue in fantasy football is ad revenue. Driven mostly by sports sites, revenue generated by ads on fantasy football programming is estimated at $2 to $5 billion annually.<ref name=\"Krossover\"/> Ad rates vary greatly, and many content providers aren't willing to give specific details on what they charge, but sites can charge an estimated $2\u2013$10 per thousand page views.<ref name=\"Cade\">{{cite web|last=Cade|first=Jeff|title=The Real Money of Fantasy Sports|url=http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/the-real-money-of-fantasy-sports-jeff-cade|publisher=MSN|accessdate=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220080834/http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/the-real-money-of-fantasy-sports-jeff-cade|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The advertising revenue can be especially lucrative because fantasy team managers are such heavy internet users. They create, on average, 4 times more page views than those that don't play fantasy sports.<ref name=\"Caldwell\">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Dave|title=NFL Sees Real Opportunity in Fantasy Football|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45961002|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Advertising isn't limited to just sports sites and television. Demand for fantasy football information has spread to mobile applications, which carry banner ads at the bottom or top of each screen.\n\n===Spending by \"team managers\" (participants)===\nAdditionally, fantasy football team managers pour money into the industry themselves. Many fantasy leagues require an entry fee, which is used to fund prizes for the league winners.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Kate|title=The Finances of a Fantasy Football Player|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|publisher=Newscorp|accessdate=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220091058/http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fees and their resulting payoffs are typically small and represent more of a transfer of wealth between players than contributions to the overall economy. However, fantasy football team managers are also more likely to spend on other industries. When compared to non-fantasy sports fans, team managers are significantly more likely to purchase alcohol, airline tickets, and sports magazines. They are also more likely to purchase fast food and soft drinks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Complementary and derivative industries===\nFantasy football has also created several complementary and derivative industries. Team managers will spend on subscription-based information sites such as rotoworld.com, draftsharks.com and Football Guys to gain an informational advantage. Fantasy leagues may also engage services to make their things run smoothly and settle disputes. Leagues may deposit collected fees with fantasy football specific escrow companies, and settle disputes regarding trades or scoring by using lawyer-run fantasy football arbitration websites for a flat fee per resolution. The excitement of drafting a team each year has led to a new derivative of fantasy football: Day or week leagues, which offer the opportunity to draft a new team and play a single game each week. Fantasy football has worked its way into pop culture with an estimated $1.67 billion contributed to the economy as of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/articles/financial-outlook-fantasy-football/| title=The Financial Outlook of Fantasy Football| author=Michael Wenrich| publisher=The Fantasy Footballers}}</ref> TV sitcoms about groups of friends playing each other in fantasy football, cable networks dedicating blocks of programming specifically to fantasy football, 24/7 satellite radio channels reporting fantasy news, and services designed to provide team managers with alerts about their player's status to their phones.<ref name=\"Cade\"/>\n\nThe rise of popularity in fantasy football has led to the growth of companies such as Fanduel and Draftkings. Draftkings has reported in net $304 million in entry fees in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2015/01/22/draftkings-reports-304-million-of-entry-fees-in-2014/#4dc734997c0e|title=DraftKings Reports $304 Million Of Entry Fees In 2014|publisher=@work|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref> This rise has also been coupled with a rise of interest in applying higher level mathematics and computer science into the fantasy industry. Scientists with advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, computer science apply algorithms, optimizations, and advanced statistics in order to hypothesize the best lineup and create the best outcome. This has led to companies exclusively with this purpose in mind, specializing in this sports analytics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-fantasy-sports-wizards-winning-formula-wsj-money-june-2014-1401893587|title=A Fantasy Sports Wizard's Winning Formula\n|publisher=@work|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on spectatorship===\nNFL executives have recognized the importance of fantasy football's success to the league overall.<ref name=\"Caldwell\"/> The explosive popularity of fantasy sports, coupled with the availability of venues showcasing numerous live football games via satellite, has had significant effects on football viewing and rooting habits among participants. Fantasy sports players watch more game telecasts, buy more tickets and spend money at stadiums at a much higher rate than general sports fans. For example, 55 percent of fantasy sports players report watching more sports on television since they started playing fantasy sports.<ref>{{cite news| title=CDM Appeals Court Victory Ensures Continued Fantasy Sports Growth| url=http://fsta.org/news/pressreleases/CBCvsMLBAM.doc?PHPSESSID=glao8etoobku1pu8q98hln9262| publisher=Fantasy Sports Trade Association| date=}}</ref> Fantasy participants also are reported to attend 0.22 to 0.57 more NFL games in person per season.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nesbit|first=Todd|title=The Impact of Fantasy Football Participation on NFL Attendance|journal=Atlantic Economic Journal|author2=King, Kerry|date=March 2010|doi=10.1007/s11293-009-9202-x|volume=38|pages=95\u2013108}}</ref> The NFL entered into a reported five-year, $600 million deal in 2006 with Sprint that was driven at least in part because of fantasy sports, allowing subscribers to draft and monitor their teams with their cellphones.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news| first=Jason| last=La Canfora| title=Beating Yourself Takes New Meaning| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/12/AR2006081200740.html| publisher=WashingtonPost.com| date=2006-08-13}}</ref> In [[2011 NFL season|2011]], the NFL directed teams to show fantasy statistics during games on the stadium video boards.<ref>{{cite news|last=Leonard |first=Tod |title=Scene & Heard: Mr. October makes an appearance |date=October 2, 2011 |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/02/scene-heard-mr-october-makes-apperance/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62KOcZLx7?url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/02/scene-heard-mr-october-makes-apperance/ |archive-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many sports and football-related sports news shows discuss fantasy-related topics. Besides the fictional ''The League'', multiple TV programs that focus on fantasy football news exist; examples include [[ESPN]]'s ''Fantasy Football Now'' and CBS's ''Fantasy Football Today''.\n\nThe way a fantasy owner watches a game is greatly affected if a player on their team is playing. An owner will root for specific things to happen in order for their player(s) to score points. For example, someone who has a running back will root for a goal-line situation or for the team the running back plays for to be up by a significant number of points. If the running back's team is on the goal line, then a running play is more likely to be called. If the running back's team is up by a significant number of points, his team will call more running plays in order to run out the clock. The more running plays called, the more points for that running back. Different scenarios will provide certain players an opportunity to score points for fantasy owners.\n\n{{rquote|right|\"Hey, great game last week.\"<br/>\"Yeah, but we lost.\"<br/>\n\"But you threw five touchdowns, and that's all I need from you.\"|A typical conversation with a fantasy fan, according to [[Peyton Manning]]{{r|ESPN.com}}}}\n\n{{rquote|right|@thrasherjt: you fucked me over in fantasy bro\n@k1: @thrasherjt I could give 2 shits.|[[Kyler Murray]] responds to a fan's complaint on Instagram<ref name=\"weinrib20191021\">{{Cite tweet |number=1186349129062068225 |user=AdamWeinrib |title=Kyler Murray doesn't care about your fantasy team |author=Adam Weinrib |date=2019-10-21}}</ref>}}\n\nCritics charge that because of the varying interests, some fantasy owners may instead support the players on their fantasy rosters in any one game rather than supporting a favorite team. Players are mixed on the impact of the effects of fantasy football on fans' habits and preferences. Retired NFL QB [[Jake Plummer]] told ESPN \"I think it's ruined the game\", and retired [[New York Giants]] RB [[Tiki Barber]] said about fantasy fans, \"there's an incongruity in the wants\".<ref name=\"ESPN.com\">{{cite web|first=Greg |last=Garber |title=Fantasy craze produces awkward moments for players |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=2684942}}</ref> However, former [[Washington Redskins]] [[tight end]] [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]] plays in four fantasy football leagues himself,<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/> and former [[Indianapolis Colts]] linebacker [[Cato June]] benched [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]] from his fantasy team to avoid a conflict of interest when the two teams played in November 2006.

Critics charge this translates into fantasy fans becoming more concerned with whether an injury will bench a player, rather than the nature, extent or seriousness of the injury, or sympathy toward the player.  For strategy reasons, many teams refuse to disclose the seriousness of a player's injury until game time.  This frustrates many fantasy owners trying to determine whether to start or bench a player whose participation is listed as \"questionable\" or \"probable\".\n\n===Wasted productivity===\nDespite all of the beneficial impacts on the economy that fantasy football provides, there are some concerns about potential economic drawbacks. The addictive nature and widespread popularity of fantasy football, combined with the relative ease of obtaining information about a manager's team have led to many hours of lost productivity at work. A rough calculation based estimates regarding the average amount of time team managers spend on their teams, combined with the number of team managers and their average wages puts the estimated impact at about $6 billion in wasted productivity. However, the study admits to being non-scientific and that its estimates are rough. Additionally, managers are often concerned with performance and disappointed when their team does not do well. Smack talk happens between team managers which may inhibit live interaction between co-workers. One example is the institution of the Rodriguez Line, where a team which frequently scores less than optimal points is openly mocked as having a sub-par team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2kzvft/whats_the_best_trashtalk_you_have_had_in_your/|title=What's the best trash talk you have had in your league this year? \u2022 /r/fantasyfootball|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, it reports that managers tend to view the impact as a minor distraction. In a poll conducted for the same study asking managers to rate the impact of fantasy football on their workplace from 1-10, about 70% reported a 4 or lower. Less than 8% reported a 7 or 8. No respondents reported a 9 or 10. Additionally, employers can even take advantage of fantasy football by embracing it and starting sanctioned work leagues. This may increase employee morale and loyalty, improving retention rates. This study also reported 40% of respondents considered fantasy football a positive influence in the workplace, with 1 in 5 also saying they have developed valuable business contacts through fantasy football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://challengeratwork.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/2012-fantasy-football-report/#more-979|title=2012 Fantasy Football Report|publisher=@work|date=1 September 2012|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{curlie|Sports/Fantasy/Football|Fantasy Football}}\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD FANTASY FOOTBALL LINKS.

The competitors choose team rosters by participating in a [[draft (sports)|draft]] in which all players of a real football league are available. Points are based on the actual performances of the players in the real-world competition. The game typically involves the [[National Football League]], [[Canadian Football League]], or [[college football]].\n\nThere are two main types of fantasy football:\n* Traditional in which the competition can run either for an entire [[season (sports)|season]] or many seasons if it is a keeper league, \n* [[Daily fantasy sports|Daily]] is an accelerated version in which the contests are conducted over shorter periods, such as a week or a single day. Daily fantasy football is managed by commercial internet companies who charge a percentage of each [[betting pool]]. In the United States, the two largest firms are [[FanDuel]] and [[DraftKings]].\n\n==History==\nModern fantasy football can be traced back to the late Wilfred \"Bill the Gill\" Winkenbach, an [[Oakland, California]] businessman and a limited partner in the [[Oakland Raiders]]. In a [[New York City]] hotel room during a 1962 Raiders cross-country trip, Winkenbach, along with Raiders Public Relations man Bill Tunnel and Tribune reporter [[Scotty Stirling]], developed a system of organization and a rule book, which would eventually be the basis of modern fantasy football.\n\nThe inaugural league was called the GOPPPL (Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League), and the first draft took place in the [[Recreation room|rumpus room]] of Winkenbach's home in [[Oakland, California]] in August 1963.<ref>{{cite web| title=Fantasy Football 101| first=Michael| last=Fabiano| date=November 18, 2008| publisher=[[National Football League]]| url=http://www.nfl.com/fantasy/story/09000d5d80021ece/article/fantasy-football-101| accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref> The league consisted of eight members, made up of administrative affiliates of the AFL, pro football journalists, or someone who had purchased or sold 10 season tickets for the Raiders\u2019 1963 season. Each roster consisted of the following in the GOPPPL: two quarterbacks, four halfbacks, two fullbacks, four offensive ends, two kick/punt returners, two field goal kickers, two defensive backs/linebackers and two defensive linemen. The current GOPPPL roster now includes two quarterbacks, four halfbacks, six wide receivers/tight ends, two kickers, two defensive backs, one return team, and a bonus pick for any position. As of 2012, the GOPPPL celebrated its 50th season and it still maintains its touchdown-only scoring heritage.\n\nIn 1969, Andy Mousalimas, an original creator of GOPPPL and participant in the inaugural draft, brought the game to his sports bar, the King's X in Oakland where he added another couple of leagues. When the patrons of other Oakland and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] bars visited for trivia contests they soon learned of fantasy football and passed the word about it.<ref>{{cite web|title=BIRTH OF FANTASY FOOTBALL|url=http://www.oulala.com/en/birth-of-fantasy-football|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> Due to the time-consuming nature of the game's scoring it was difficult to pick up and spread slowly across the country.\n\nThe Indoor Football League (IFL) began in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in the fall of 1980 by a group of six students at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-herald.com/sports/20160821/fantasy-football-league-originated-in-northest-ohio-entering-36th-season|title=Fantasy football league originated in Northeast Ohio entering 36th season|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Charter members Tom Spear and Jeff Kornreich came up with the idea of forming a league after reading a short article by Glenn Ferry in the September 1980 issue of Inside Sports magazine.<ref>Ferry, Glenn (30 September 1980).  \u201cRunning Your Own Football Franchise for Fun and Profit\u201d.

Participants created a team of NFL players, earned stats for those players based on actual performance, traded those players on a daily basis, and accrued points in an effort to compete against one another to win prizes.

Within three years, all major sports media websites launched competing for fantasy football hosting websites. The NFL released their own official game in 2010, NFL.com Fantasy Football, further driving industry growth. Fantasy football is now the single most important marketing tool for the NFL.

The two most popular league types are head-to-head and total points leagues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/types-of-fantasy-football-leagues-1335391|title=From Standard to Keeper: 6 Types of Fantasy Football Leagues|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n* <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://football.about.com/od/fantasygames/a/fantasyleagues.htm|title=From Standard to Keeper: 6 Types of Fantasy Football Leagues|newspaper=About.com Sports|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> In '''head-to-head leagues''', a fantasy team matches up against a different fantasy team from the league each week. The team that receives the most points of the two receives a win for that week. Points are dictated by the scoring system that is either standard set by the website or custom set by the league. A team's total is the sum of all players' points who were placed in a starting slot by the team owner for the day they were playing (as opposed to being on the bench, in which any points gained would not count). Teams with the best win-loss record advance to the playoffs. If two teams have the same record, tiebreakers are employed based on league preference.\n* '''Total points leagues''' are leagues in which teams accumulate points on an ongoing basis. The league standings are determined by the teams\u2019 total points. The most popular total points leagues are \"best-ball\" leagues, where the week-to-week roster management is removed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/yahoo-best-ball-is-here-101-guide-on-how-to-play-this-lowmaintenance-fantasy-game-221809010.html|title=Yahoo Best Ball is here: 101 guide on how to play this low-maintenance fantasy game|website=sports.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> Playoff leagues are also frequently total points leagues. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/nfl-playoff-fantasy-leagues/|title=NFL Playoff Fantasy Leagues|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n* '''All play leagues''' are leagues in which all teams play each other each week. For example, if there are 14 teams in the league, the top scoring team that week would post a 13\u20130 record, 2nd highest scoring team would post a 12\u20131 record and so on.\n* A '''Keeper style league''' allows teams to keep a set number of players from one year to the next and sometimes assign them contracts. In the first season of a keeper league, the draft is performed the same as any other standard league draft would be performed. In a keeper league you cut your roster limit to a certain number each offseason. Keeper leagues can keep as few as 1 or as many as even 16 or more in deeper keeper leagues. If your roster limit is cut down in the offseason, it's a keeper league as opposed to a dynasty league where you maintain your entire roster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dummies.com/sports/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/fantasy-football-keeper-leagues/|title=Fantasy Football Keeper Leagues|website=dummies|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n* A '''Salary cap league''' is a particular type of fantasy league which adds another factor of realism similar to the NFL: the salary cap. Each player has an associated salary and the total spent on all the players on a team has a maximum - the \"salary cap.\"\n* In '''Auction leagues''', a team is composed of players who are bought auction-style during the draft, as opposed to using traditional snake drafts that are common in fantasy football. Each team is given a budget to bid on players. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/fantasy-football-auction-drafts/|title=Fantasy Football Auction Drafts|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n* In '''Dynasty leagues''', a team keeps all players from year to year and replenishes rosters through rookie drafts. Dynasty leagues are enhanced versions of keeper leagues. In dynasty leagues, your roster limit is unchanged in the offseason, or increases temporarily to allow the addition of rookies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/dynasty-fantasy-football-leagues/|title=Dynasty Fantasy Football Leagues|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n* In '''Two-quarterback leagues''', a team has the ability to start two quarterbacks in their weekly lineup.  This changes the value of the quarterback position, as it doubles the number of quarterbacks able to start in any given week. However, in any fantasy football format, the number of quarterbacks who can start is determined by the league commissioner.\n* In '''Empire leagues''', teams compete in a dynasty-format and prizes are offered for league winners. A special side-pot is created from entry fees each year. Once an owner wins the league two years in a row, the Empire pot goes to that owner, and the league starts over.\n* '''SuperFlex Leagues''' are leagues in which teams can start a QB in the flex position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/ppr-scoring/|title=PPR Scoring|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> Generally, a superflex position is added in addition to traditional roster spots such as a flex position. Often, defenses and kickers are removed from these league formats.\n* '''IDP or Individual Defensive Player leagues''' are leagues where teams draft individual defensive players in addition to offensive players, as opposed to drafting an NFL team's defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monksidpweeknflfantasyfootball.com/play-idp-fantasy-football-nfl-individual-defensive-player-leagues|title=How to Play IDP Fantasy Football - NFL Individual Defensive Player Leagues|author=|date=|website=monksidpweeknflfantasyfootball.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Pirate Leagues''' are leagues where a winning team gets to choose a player from his opponent's roster.\n* '''[[Daily Fantasy Sports|Daily fantasy sports]]''' is like traditional fantasy sports where players draft a team of real-world athletes who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However, instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day (or in the case of NFL, one weekend). Users can play head-to-head or in larger field tournaments. Both cash leagues and free contests are available for play.\n\n==Draft==\nEach season, fantasy football leagues hold a draft (note: in dynasty leagues, this normally consists of NFL rookies only), where each team drafts NFL players. These players are kept unless they are traded or dropped, whereby they enter a pool of unowned players that any team may claim. In most leagues, no player may be owned by more than one team, although some leagues do allow for this.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abshier|first=Adam|title=THE FUNDAMENTALS OF A LIVE FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT|url=http://www.dummies.com/sports/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/the-fundamentals-of-a-live-fantasy-football-draft/|work=Dummies|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> There are essentially two types of drafts. In a traditional \"serpentine\" or \"snake\" draft, owners take turns drafting players in a \"snake\" method, i.e. the owner who picks first in the odd rounds picks last in the even rounds, in the interests of fairness.\n\nIn an auction draft, each owner has an imaginary budget which he must use to purchase all his players in an auction format. Owners take turns nominating players for open bid. The owner who bids the highest on each player receives that player, reducing their remaining budget accordingly. Auction drafts are viewed as the more fair method since every owner begins on equal ground.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ludwig|first=Eric|title=Auction Drafts for Beginners|url=https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/articles/auction-drafts-beginners/|work=The Fantasy Footballers|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> A few leagues use a hybrid of the two styles, selecting a portion of their roster via auction, with the remainder selected through a serpentine method.\n\nThe most commonly used strategies are value-based drafting and opinion-based drafting. Value-based drafting entails projecting the total fantasy point value for each player in the draft and then figuring their value with respect to other players at their position, while standard opinion-based drafting requires ranking each player based on your opinion of worth or other people's opinion of said player's worth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gresham|first=Chet|title=Fantasy Football Draft Strategy: Evaluating Value Based Drafting|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1242943-fantasy-football-draft-strategy-evaluating-value-based-drafting|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nDrafts can be conducted in \"live\" or \"auto\" formats. Live drafts involve players utilizing real-time strategy and reactionary measures to acquire specific available players. Auto-drafts use preliminary draft rankings set by each team to automate the draft cycle and establish the teams. Live drafts are often preferred to automated as they are believed to require more skill.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hockensmith|first=Dustin|title=Fantasy football mailbag: Auto-draft strategy and where to rank quarterbacks|url=http://www.pennlive.com/fantasy_football/2014/09/fantasy_football_mailbag_auto-.html|work=PA Live|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe location of fantasy football drafts depends on the geographic location of each team manager. With the rise of the internet, all fantasy football providers have made online drafting an option for leagues in which the managers are too far away to meet up in person. Other leagues make a tradition of meeting up to draft, and in some leagues, managers travel cross-country to attend annual league drafts. Group drafts conducted in-person are typically scheduled many weeks in advance. Common locations include boardrooms, offices, bars, or dining establishments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gelhar|first=Alex|title=How to play fantasy football: A beginner's guide|work=NFL}}</ref> Once the league is full with team owners, the order of the draft numbers should be initiated by either a random in-person or computer-based draft order, or, in a keeper or dynasty league, the draft order runs in reverse order of the previous year's standings.\n\nLastly, another addition that the ESPN fantasy football creators should incorporate in their next update include; live draft trades either for players or additional draft picks. Multiple draft picks can be traded for a player or a player can be traded for draft picks. Draft picks can also be traded for more additional draft picks.\n\n== Team rosters ==\nEach team is allowed a predetermined number of players on its roster, as well as a specified number at each position that can or must be used in each game (the \"starters\"). Owners for each team then determine each week which players will start (within the rules) and which will be \"benched\". Just like in real football, bench players can become starters for various reasons: due to other players' injury, poor performance, or if another player's team has a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] that week.\n\nEach week, owners choose their starters for a game before a certain deadline. Whether to sit or start a player is usually based on strategic considerations including the player's past and expected performance, defensive matchups, the team he is playing that week and so on.\n\n=== Starters ===\nEach team owner must designate which players from the team roster will be starters each week - i.e. the only players who will \"score\" any points. The following example is similar to many common formats required for a starting lineup:\n* 1 [[Quarterback]] (QB)\n* 2 [[Running Back]]s (RB)\n* 2 [[Wide Receiver]]s (WR)\n* 1 Flex (choose from RB/WR/TEs) \n* 1 [[Tight End]] (TE)\n* 1 [[Placekicker]] (K)\n* 1 Team Defense/Special Teams (D/ST)\n* 6 Bench (BN)\nThere are many variants on this. Some leagues use individual defensive players (IDPs) (and in some cases a punter) instead of or in addition to a combined Team Defense/Special Teams. Some other leagues use separate Defense and Special Teams. Another variant is the \"flex\" position, which can be filled by a player in one of several positions. Flex positions are often limited to \"WR/TE\", \"RB/WR\", or \"RB/WR/TE\". Traditionally, this flex was required to be an RB, WR, or TE; however, some leagues allow any position to fill this flex slot as an \"OP\" (any player who plays a position on offense) or \"superflex\". Some leagues also have a two-quarterback requirement for a starting lineup, providing yet another twist into the complexity of different scoring systems and lineups.\n\n=== Scoring configurations ===\nLeague managers earn team points based on their ''starting'' players' performances in weekly NFL games. Players accumulate points based purely on their statistical output. For example, a touchdown might be worth six points while each yard passed, rushed, or carried may be worth a certain number of points, and so on. In most cases, players earn points for passing, rushing, and receiving yards.\n\nAlthough kickers can theoretically score points through touchdowns or yards rushed and received, they mainly accumulate most of their points through field goals and extra points. The Team Defense / Special Teams position earns points through defensive plays (such as turnovers, [[quarterback sack]]s, safeties, and blocked kicks) and by limiting the offensive points of the opposing teams.  Also, whereas points are awarded to players for positive plays, points are taken away from players for negative plays such as turnovers or missed kicks.\n\n==== Standard scoring ====\n\nThe standard fantasy football scoring system comprises a well-respected baseline of statistic/point-value pairs designed to promote balance across the various fantasy positions.<ref>{{cite web| last = Perniciaro| first = Brad| authorlink =| title = Standard Fantasy Football Scoring & Points System Guide| website =| publisher = Cheatsheetwarroom.com| date = 2011-04-10| url = http://www.cheatsheetwarroom.com/blog/post/standard-fantasy-football-scoring-system.aspx| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2014-04-22 }}</ref> This is the typical scoring configuration chosen by first time fantasy football commissioners because it is a very basic points system which is fair and intuitive for fantasy novices.\n\nA typical standard scoring format would look very similar to this, although there may be slight discrepancies in points awarded to kickers (depending on the league host's scoring limitations):\n* 1 point for 25 passing yards\n* 1 point for 10 rushing yards\n* 1 point for 10 receiving yards\n* 6 points for a touchdown\n* 4 points for a passing touchdown\n* -2 points for every interception thrown or fumble lost\n* 1 point for each extra point made\n* 3 points for each 0-39 yard field goal, 4 points for each 40-49 yard field goal, and 5 points for each 50+ yard field goal\n* 2 points per turnover gained by defense\n* 1 point per sack by the defense\n* 2 points for a safety by defense\n* 6 points for each touchdown scored by the defense\n* 2 points for each blocked kick<ref>Remember to start the players you think will have the most \"Fantasy Points\".{{cite web| last = Eisenberg| first = Jamey| authorlink = | title = Draft prep: How to start a Fantasy league| website = | publisher = CBSSports.com| date = 2008-07-18| url = http://fantasynews.sportsline.com/fantasyfootball/story/10900399| format = | doi = | access-date = 2008-08-11| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080813121305/http://fantasynews.sportsline.com/fantasyfootball/story/10900399| archive-date = 2008-08-13| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Points-per-reception (PPR) ====\nPoints-per-reception leagues were created as an effort to make wide receivers and tight ends more relevant to fantasy scoring.  In this alternate scoring system, fractional or full points are awarded for every reception tallied by a player.  This changes the value of players in standard scoring systems, as running backs who catch many passes become more valuable, those who catch fewer are less valuable, and so on.  Certain leagues vary the points respective positions earn for receptions. In a survey conducted by [[Apex Fantasy Leagues]], PPR scoring was found to be the most popular scoring system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/fantasy-football-survey-results/|title=Fantasy Football Survey Results|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, [[Yahoo]] adopted a Half-PPR scoring system as the default scoring system for new leagues on their fantasy football platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasypros.com/2018/08/expert-consensus-rankings-vs-yahoo-pre-draft-rankings-2018-fantasy-football/ | title= Expert Consensus Rankings vs. Yahoo!

Many of the original fantasy football leagues were pure-scoring leagues as this provided for easier tracking of team points throughout the season. As the game matured and moved online, it became easier to track yardage and more sophisticated scoring configurations were adopted.\n\n==== Pure yardage leagues ====\n\nAn alternate scoring format is the \"pure yardage\" league, in which touchdowns are ignored, and each player's passing, rushing and receiving yards are totaled. Some yardage leagues also convert defensive stats into yards (ex., 50 yards for an interception, 20 yards for a sack), whether for a team's defense, or individual players.\n\n==== Individual defensive player (IDP) ====\n\nAn alternative method for scoring defense is Individual Defensive Players or IDP fantasy football. The main difference being that players typically draft anywhere from 3 to 7 individual defensive players during a draft as opposed to just one team defense. Sometimes there are required positions to fill like 2 Linebackers, 2 Defensive Backs and 2 Defensive Linemen and sometimes it's just 5 defensive players of any position you choose. There are many different ways to draft IDPs and many have found this makes the later part of the fantasy draft more exciting. For instance, instead of drafting a 5th wide receiver in the 16th round that will typically be on your bench or dropped part way through the season, you are instead drafting a \"full-time\" starting defensive player that can help you win your league.\n\n==== Performance-based bonuses ====\n\nSome leagues allow bonuses to be awarded to players for exceptionally good performances, like a QB throwing for over 300 yards.  Running backs or wide receivers could similarly be awarded a performance bonus based on accumulating more than 100 yards on the ground or through the air.  Kickers could even be awarded for long field goals, generally 50 yards or longer.\n\n====Rollover====\nIn some fantasy football leagues, a player that receives a lot of points in one week may save them to use in a future fantasy game. Specific rules vary from league-to-league. This ruling has many variations, as does the scoring systems of fantasy football leagues, but the ruling that is considered to be \u201cstandard\u201d is defined as follows:\nAny team that scores in excess of 140 points in any one week is eligible for the rollover rule; provided they won the match-up for that week; and with the score of 140 points would have still won the match-up for the week.  If the previous is true then the rollover ruling applies, which states; \u201cany team eligible for the rule may use the points earned in excess of 140 on any future match-up for the remainder of the season\u201d, with the following provisions attached:\nThe team electing to use rollover points must make it publicly known to all other teams, twenty-four hours prior to the kickoff of the first game, that they will be using the points that week; rollover points cannot be used for post-season games; rollover points must be used completely and cannot be broken up over multiple weeks, i.e. if a team has 5 rollover points they must be used on one week, not 1 point per week for five weeks; rollover points must be used in the current season; if rollover points have not been used and a team is eligible for additional from another week the points will be added and can only be used in one week.\n\n===League manager and gambling===\nMany leagues are composed of friends, family, co-workers, and even strangers that are in the fantasy league to prove who is the greatest \"couch coach\". Millions of dollars are won and lost each year in fantasy sports league betting. Some leagues are managed by players in the leagues, while other leagues are run by independent businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|title=The Finances of a Fantasy Football Player|author=Kate Rogers|date=|work=Fox Business|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043455/http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though the traditional fame of the game was for respect and pride within groups,  gambling has gained a more prominent role. The Federal government determined that fantasy league gambling is not a \"game of chance\" and as such is not illegal, however, alterations to the rules can cause a fantasy league to skew too far into chance and lose federal protection. At the state level, including [[Arizona]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], and [[Vermont]] have banned certain activities related to fantasy football, such as the collection of league fees and payout of winnings, when done so online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chakraborty|first=Barnini|title=Gaming laws could pose risk for fantasy football craze|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/31/gaming-laws-pose-risk-for-fantasy-football-craze/|publisher=Newscorp|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Florida has an outright ban on all fantasy football, though how the ban is enforced appears to be unclear. Fantasy football continues unabated in all of these states, so it appears none of these regulations have any effect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Mark|title=Is it Legal to Play Fantasy Football for Money?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2013/09/03/is-it-legal-to-play-fantasy-football-for-money/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome Fantasy Football leagues wager things other than money, such as the loser of the league fulfilling a punishment. For example, the last place finisher must get a tattoo, and that tattoo has to be of what the winner of the league wants. The only thing that the loser gets any say in is the location of the tattoo. The owners of the teams have to sign a contract before the season to agree to the punishment if they lose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/09/17/fantasy-football-league-tattoos/|title=The Loser of This Fantasy Football League Gets a Heinous Tattoo|author=Sam Laird|date=18 September 2013|work=Mashable|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>  Other high-stakes leagues offer prizes of US$250,000 to the ultimate champion.\n\n===All individual players===\nThere are several dynasty leagues that follow the NFL's roster model and score all possible NFL players at all individual positions. Offensive linemen (OL) are scored by total yards and points minus sacks given up. Fullbacks are partially scored as offensive linemen because of their blocking duties. Kick and punt returners are scored by yardage and touchdowns. Punters are scored by net average and punts inside the 20-yard line.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association|FSTA]], approximately 41 million people play fantasy sports every year with an average age of 34. 18% of the market is held by teens, an important demographic because more than 80% of all users say they are likely to continue playing for at least the next decade and more than 40% say they will play for life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Industry Demographics|url=http://www.fsta.org/?page=demographics|publisher=FTSA|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> 80% of all team managers are male. 89.8% of them are white and 51.5% are not married. 78% hold a bachelor's degree or higher, likely making the majority of team managers an upper-middle-class earner with a median income between $60\u2013100K.<ref name=\"Krossover\">{{cite web|title=Fantasy Football: The Economics of an American Obsession|url=http://www.krossover.com/blog/2012/08/fantasy-football-the-economics-of-an-american-obsession/|publisher=Krossover|accessdate=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109204942/http://www.krossover.com/blog/2012/08/fantasy-football-the-economics-of-an-american-obsession/|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on American economy==\nThe economic impacts of fantasy football are vast in number and value. Most of the impacts are positive on the economy overall, but there are some relatively minor drawbacks. Growth rates in fantasy football showed no signs of slowing down over the past few years.<ref name=\"Krossover\"/> While team managers are drawn to fantasy football because they can get started and play for free, they are still likely to spend on many of fantasy football's complementary industries.\n\n===Ad revenue===\nOne of the largest sources of revenue in fantasy football is ad revenue. Driven mostly by sports sites, revenue generated by ads on fantasy football programming is estimated at $2 to $5 billion annually.<ref name=\"Krossover\"/> Ad rates vary greatly, and many content providers aren't willing to give specific details on what they charge, but sites can charge an estimated $2\u2013$10 per thousand page views.<ref name=\"Cade\">{{cite web|last=Cade|first=Jeff|title=The Real Money of Fantasy Sports|url=http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/the-real-money-of-fantasy-sports-jeff-cade|publisher=MSN|accessdate=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220080834/http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/the-real-money-of-fantasy-sports-jeff-cade|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The advertising revenue can be especially lucrative because fantasy team managers are such heavy internet users. They create, on average, 4 times more page views than those that don't play fantasy sports.<ref name=\"Caldwell\">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Dave|title=NFL Sees Real Opportunity in Fantasy Football|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45961002|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Advertising isn't limited to just sports sites and television. Demand for fantasy football information has spread to mobile applications, which carry banner ads at the bottom or top of each screen.\n\n===Spending by \"team managers\" (participants)===\nAdditionally, fantasy football team managers pour money into the industry themselves. Many fantasy leagues require an entry fee, which is used to fund prizes for the league winners.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Kate|title=The Finances of a Fantasy Football Player|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|publisher=Newscorp|accessdate=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220091058/http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/04/finances-fantasy-football-player/|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fees and their resulting payoffs are typically small and represent more of a transfer of wealth between players than contributions to the overall economy. However, fantasy football team managers are also more likely to spend on other industries. When compared to non-fantasy sports fans, team managers are significantly more likely to purchase alcohol, airline tickets, and sports magazines. They are also more likely to purchase fast food and soft drinks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Complementary and derivative industries===\nFantasy football has also created several complementary and derivative industries. Team managers will spend on subscription-based information sites such as rotoworld.com, draftsharks.com and Football Guys to gain an informational advantage. Fantasy leagues may also engage services to make their things run smoothly and settle disputes. Leagues may deposit collected fees with fantasy football specific escrow companies, and settle disputes regarding trades or scoring by using lawyer-run fantasy football arbitration websites for a flat fee per resolution. The excitement of drafting a team each year has led to a new derivative of fantasy football: Day or week leagues, which offer the opportunity to draft a new team and play a single game each week. Fantasy football has worked its way into pop culture with an estimated $1.67 billion contributed to the economy as of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/articles/financial-outlook-fantasy-football/| title=The Financial Outlook of Fantasy Football| author=Michael Wenrich| publisher=The Fantasy Footballers}}</ref> TV sitcoms about groups of friends playing each other in fantasy football, cable networks dedicating blocks of programming specifically to fantasy football, 24/7 satellite radio channels reporting fantasy news, and services designed to provide team managers with alerts about their player's status to their phones.<ref name=\"Cade\"/>\n\nThe rise of popularity in fantasy football has led to the growth of companies such as Fanduel and Draftkings.

Scientists with advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, computer science apply algorithms, optimizations, and advanced statistics in order to hypothesize the best lineup and create the best outcome. This has led to companies exclusively with this purpose in mind, specializing in this sports analytics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-fantasy-sports-wizards-winning-formula-wsj-money-june-2014-1401893587|title=A Fantasy Sports Wizard's Winning Formula\n|publisher=@work|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on spectatorship===\nNFL executives have recognized the importance of fantasy football's success to the league overall.<ref name=\"Caldwell\"/> The explosive popularity of fantasy sports, coupled with the availability of venues showcasing numerous live football games via satellite, has had significant effects on football viewing and rooting habits among participants. Fantasy sports players watch more game telecasts, buy more tickets and spend money at stadiums at a much higher rate than general sports fans. For example, 55 percent of fantasy sports players report watching more sports on television since they started playing fantasy sports.<ref>{{cite news| title=CDM Appeals Court Victory Ensures Continued Fantasy Sports Growth| url=http://fsta.org/news/pressreleases/CBCvsMLBAM.doc?PHPSESSID=glao8etoobku1pu8q98hln9262| publisher=Fantasy Sports Trade Association| date=}}</ref> Fantasy participants also are reported to attend 0.22 to 0.57 more NFL games in person per season.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nesbit|first=Todd|title=The Impact of Fantasy Football Participation on NFL Attendance|journal=Atlantic Economic Journal|author2=King, Kerry|date=March 2010|doi=10.1007/s11293-009-9202-x|volume=38|pages=95\u2013108}}</ref> The NFL entered into a reported five-year, $600 million deal in 2006 with Sprint that was driven at least in part because of fantasy sports, allowing subscribers to draft and monitor their teams with their cellphones.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news| first=Jason| last=La Canfora| title=Beating Yourself Takes New Meaning| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/12/AR2006081200740.html| publisher=WashingtonPost.com| date=2006-08-13}}</ref> In [[2011 NFL season|2011]], the NFL directed teams to show fantasy statistics during games on the stadium video boards.<ref>{{cite news|last=Leonard |first=Tod |title=Scene & Heard: Mr. October makes an appearance |date=October 2, 2011 |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/02/scene-heard-mr-october-makes-apperance/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62KOcZLx7?url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/02/scene-heard-mr-october-makes-apperance/ |archive-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many sports and football-related sports news shows discuss fantasy-related topics. Besides the fictional ''The League'', multiple TV programs that focus on fantasy football news exist; examples include [[ESPN]]'s ''Fantasy Football Now'' and CBS's ''Fantasy Football Today''.\n\nThe way a fantasy owner watches a game is greatly affected if a player on their team is playing. An owner will root for specific things to happen in order for their player(s) to score points. For example, someone who has a running back will root for a goal-line situation or for the team the running back plays for to be up by a significant number of points. If the running back's team is on the goal line, then a running play is more likely to be called. If the running back's team is up by a significant number of points, his team will call more running plays in order to run out the clock. The more running plays called, the more points for that running back. Different scenarios will provide certain players an opportunity to score points for fantasy owners.\n\n{{rquote|right|\"Hey, great game last week.\"<br/>\"Yeah, but we lost.\"<br/>\n\"But you threw five touchdowns, and that's all I need from you.\"|A typical conversation with a fantasy fan, according to [[Peyton Manning]]{{r|ESPN.com}}}}\n\n{{rquote|right|@thrasherjt: you fucked me over in fantasy bro\n@k1: @thrasherjt I could give 2 shits.|[[Kyler Murray]] responds to a fan's complaint on Instagram<ref name=\"weinrib20191021\">{{Cite tweet |number=1186349129062068225 |user=AdamWeinrib |title=Kyler Murray doesn't care about your fantasy team |author=Adam Weinrib |date=2019-10-21}}</ref>}}\n\nCritics charge that because of the varying interests, some fantasy owners may instead support the players on their fantasy rosters in any one game rather than supporting a favorite team. Players are mixed on the impact of the effects of fantasy football on fans' habits and preferences. Retired NFL QB [[Jake Plummer]] told ESPN \"I think it's ruined the game\", and retired [[New York Giants]] RB [[Tiki Barber]] said about fantasy fans, \"there's an incongruity in the wants\".<ref name=\"ESPN.com\">{{cite web|first=Greg |last=Garber |title=Fantasy craze produces awkward moments for players |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=2684942}}</ref> However, former [[Washington Redskins]] [[tight end]] [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]] plays in four fantasy football leagues himself,<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/> and former [[Indianapolis Colts]] linebacker [[Cato June]] benched [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]] from his fantasy team to avoid a conflict of interest when the two teams played in November 2006.

Critics charge this translates into fantasy fans becoming more concerned with whether an injury will bench a player, rather than the nature, extent or seriousness of the injury, or sympathy toward the player.  For strategy reasons, many teams refuse to disclose the seriousness of a player's injury until game time.  This frustrates many fantasy owners trying to determine whether to start or bench a player whose participation is listed as \"questionable\" or \"probable\".\n\n===Wasted productivity===\nDespite all of the beneficial impacts on the economy that fantasy football provides, there are some concerns about potential economic drawbacks. The addictive nature and widespread popularity of fantasy football, combined with the relative ease of obtaining information about a manager's team have led to many hours of lost productivity at work. A rough calculation based estimates regarding the average amount of time team managers spend on their teams, combined with the number of team managers and their average wages puts the estimated impact at about $6 billion in wasted productivity. However, the study admits to being non-scientific and that its estimates are rough. Additionally, managers are often concerned with performance and disappointed when their team does not do well. Smack talk happens between team managers which may inhibit live interaction between co-workers. One example is the institution of the Rodriguez Line, where a team which frequently scores less than optimal points is openly mocked as having a sub-par team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2kzvft/whats_the_best_trashtalk_you_have_had_in_your/|title=What's the best trash talk you have had in your league this year? \u2022 /r/fantasyfootball|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, it reports that managers tend to view the impact as a minor distraction. In a poll conducted for the same study asking managers to rate the impact of fantasy football on their workplace from 1-10, about 70% reported a 4 or lower. Less than 8% reported a 7 or 8. No respondents reported a 9 or 10. Additionally, employers can even take advantage of fantasy football by embracing it and starting sanctioned work leagues. This may increase employee morale and loyalty, improving retention rates. This study also reported 40% of respondents considered fantasy football a positive influence in the workplace, with 1 in 5 also saying they have developed valuable business contacts through fantasy football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://challengeratwork.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/2012-fantasy-football-report/#more-979|title=2012 Fantasy Football Report|publisher=@work|date=1 September 2012|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{curlie|Sports/Fantasy/Football|Fantasy Football}}\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD FANTASY FOOTBALL LINKS.
