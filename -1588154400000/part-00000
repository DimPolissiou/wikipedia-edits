Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child's feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child's autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication and both control and support are balanced. Research{{vague|date=March 2017}} shows that this style is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style.\n\n;Authoritarian parenting styles\n:Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations that are strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and insure future obedience.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> This parenting style is strongly associated with [[corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]] and \"Because I said so\" is a typical response to a child's question of authority. This type of parenting is seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In 1983 Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, more moody and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases these children also demonstrated passive hostility.\n\n;Permissive parenting\n:Permissive, or indulgent, parenting is more popular in middle-class than in working-class families{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In these settings, a child's freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents tend to rely mostly on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, so there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this style of parenting. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever the child wants at the time. Children of permissive parents are generally happy but sometimes show low levels of self-control and self-reliance because they lack structure at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style|title=permissive parenting|last=|first=|date=|website=MSU.EDU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n;Uninvolved parenting\n:An uninvolved or neglectful parenting style is when parents are often emotionally or physically absent.<ref name=\"DOI:10.1080/01494920802010140\" /> They have little to no expectation of the child and regularly have no communication.

Those who come from a negative or vulnerable childhood environment  frequently (often unintentionally) mimic their parents' behavior during interactions with their own children. Parents with inadequate understanding of developmental milestones may also demonstrate problematic parenting. Parenting practices are of particular importance during marital transitions like separation, divorce and remarriage;<ref>Patterson et al.

Indigenous myths and folklore often personify animals and objects, reaffirming the belief that everything possesses a soul and deserves respect. These stories also help preserve language and are used to reflect certain values or cultural histories.<ref>Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.{{page needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe ''consejo'' is a [[Narrative#In cultural storytelling|narrative]] form of advice-giving. Rather than directly telling the child what to do in a particular situation, the parent might instead tell a story about a similar situation. The main character in the story is intended to help the child see what the implications of their decision may be, without directly making the decision for them. This teaches the child to be decisive and independent, while still providing some guidance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delgado-Gaitan |first1=Concha |title=Consejos: The Power of Cultural Narratives |journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=298\u2013316 |jstor=3195848 |doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.3.04x0146p}}</ref>\n\nThe playful form of [[Teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|teasing]] is a parenting method used in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This parenting strategy utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that fear creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.<ref>Brown, P. (2002).

Children largely learn about this concept via [[Nonverbal communication#Children's Learning in Indigenous American Communities|nonverbal communication]] between parents and other family members.<ref name=\"Source 1996\">Source: Chisholm, J.S.

On this run, the community uses humor and laughter with each other, without directly including the child\u2014who may not wish to get up early and run\u2014to encourage the child to participate and become an active member of the community.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" /> Parents also promote participation in the morning runs by placing their child in the snow and having them stay longer if they protest.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" />[[File:Indians of Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico, making pottery, 1916 - NARA - 519165.jpg|thumb|Indians of Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico, making pottery, 1916]]\n\nIndigenous American parents often [[Child integration|incorporate children]] into everyday life, including adult activities, allowing the child to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn through observation]].

Although this is an exception to their cultural preference for incorporating children into activities, including cooking, it is a strong example of observational learning. Mayan girls can only watch their mothers making tortillas for a few minutes at a time, but the sacredness of the activity captures their interest. They will then go and practice the movements their mother used on other objects, such as kneading thin pieces of plastic like a tortilla. From this practice, when a girl comes of age, she is able to sit down and make tortillas without having ever received any explicit verbal instruction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaskins|first1=Suzanne|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|editor1-last=Lancy|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Bock|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Gaskins|editor3-first=Suzanne|title=The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood|date=2010|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=United Kingdom|chapter=Learning Through Observation in Daily Life}}</ref>\n\n==Across the lifespan==\n\n===Pre-pregnancy===\n{{Main|Family planning|Prenatal care}}\n[[Family planning]] is the decision-making process surrounding whether and when to become parents, including planning, preparing, and gathering resources.

A newborn's basic needs are food, sleep, comfort and cleaning which the parent provides. An infant's only form of communication is crying, and attentive parents will begin to recognize different types of [[crying]] which represent different needs such as hunger, discomfort, boredom, or loneliness. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours which is disruptive to adult [[Sleep cycle#Stages of sleep|sleep cycles]]. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling and caressing. Gentle rocking back and forth often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or a [[pacifier]]. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. [[Breastfeeding]] is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations.<ref name=\"AAP_Policy\">{{cite journal | title=Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk | author=Gartner LM |author2=Morton J |author3=Lawrence RA |author4=Naylor AJ |author5=O'Hare D |author6=Schanler RJ |author7=Eidelman AI | journal=Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue=2 |date=February 2005 | pages=496\u2013506 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2491 | pmid=15687461|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref> If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative.

Attachment is not the same as love or affection, although they often go together. Attachments develop immediately and a lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted attachment can potentially do serious damage to a child's health and well-being. Physically, one may not see symptoms or indications of a disorder but the child may be emotionally affected. Studies show that children with secure attachment have the ability to form successful relationships, express themselves on an interpersonal basis and have higher self-esteem {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the [[toddler]] to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette such as being polite and taking turns.<ref>https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/manners/teaching-kids-to-mind-their-manners/</ref>[[File:Parenting.JPG|thumb|A father and daughter in [[Trivandrum]], [[India]]|left]]Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and eager to explore it.

[[Tantrum]]s begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the 'Terrible Twos'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safekids.co.uk/terrible-twos-explained.html |title=The Terrible Twos Explained - Safe Kids (UK) |publisher=Safe Kids |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> Tantrums are often caused by the child's frustration over the particular situation, sometimes simply not being able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child's responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often behave badly with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors, giving threats or punishments is not helpful and will only make the situation worse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pitman|first=Teresa|title=Toddler Frustration|url=http://www.todaysparent.com/toddler/toddler-behaviour/toddler-frustration|publisher=Todaysparent|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>  Research groups led by [[Daniel Schechter]], Alytia Levendosky, and others have shown that parents with histories of maltreatment and violence exposure often have difficulty helping their toddlers and preschool-age children with these very same emotionally dysregulated behaviors, which can remind traumatized parents of their adverse experiences and associated mental states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schechter |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Willheim |first2=Erica |last3=Hinojosa |first3=Claudia |last4=Scholfield-Kleinman |first4=Kimberly |last5=Turner |first5=J.

Young children demand constant attention, but gradually learn how to deal with boredom and be able to play independently. They also enjoy helping and feeling useful and capable. Parents may assist their child by encouraging social interactions and modeling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties.

Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with \"[[rebellious]]\" [[teenager]]s who consistently push the limits. In order to prevent these issues, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved by planning and taking part in fun activities together, keeping promises made to the children, spending time with them, not reminding kids about their past mistakes and listening to and talking to them.\n\nWhen a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping the children build a strong foundation will help them resist negative peer pressure.\n\n===Adults===\nParenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood. Parenting can be a lifelong process.\n\nParents may provide financial support to their adult children, which can also include providing an inheritance after death.

Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child's feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child's autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication and both control and support are balanced. Research{{vague|date=March 2017}} shows that this style is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style.\n\n;Authoritarian parenting styles\n:Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations that are strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and insure future obedience.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> This parenting style is strongly associated with [[corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]] and \"Because I said so\" is a typical response to a child's question of authority. This type of parenting is seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In 1983 Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, more moody and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases these children also demonstrated passive hostility.\n\n;Permissive parenting\n:Permissive, or indulgent, parenting is more popular in middle-class than in working-class families{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In these settings, a child's freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents tend to rely mostly on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, so there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this style of parenting. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever the child wants at the time. Children of permissive parents are generally happy but sometimes show low levels of self-control and self-reliance because they lack structure at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style|title=permissive parenting|last=|first=|date=|website=MSU.EDU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n;Uninvolved parenting\n:An uninvolved or neglectful parenting style is when parents are often emotionally or physically absent.<ref name=\"DOI:10.1080/01494920802010140\" /> They have little to no expectation of the child and regularly have no communication.

Indigenous myths and folklore often personify animals and objects, reaffirming the belief that everything possesses a soul and deserves respect. These stories also help preserve language and are used to reflect certain values or cultural histories.<ref>Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.{{page needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe ''consejo'' is a [[Narrative#In cultural storytelling|narrative]] form of advice-giving. Rather than directly telling the child what to do in a particular situation, the parent might instead tell a story about a similar situation. The main character in the story is intended to help the child see what the implications of their decision may be, without directly making the decision for them. This teaches the child to be decisive and independent, while still providing some guidance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delgado-Gaitan |first1=Concha |title=Consejos: The Power of Cultural Narratives |journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=298\u2013316 |jstor=3195848 |doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.3.04x0146p}}</ref>\n\nThe playful form of [[Teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|teasing]] is a parenting method used in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This parenting strategy utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that fear creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.<ref>Brown, P. (2002).

Children largely learn about this concept via [[Nonverbal communication#Children's Learning in Indigenous American Communities|nonverbal communication]] between parents and other family members.<ref name=\"Source 1996\">Source: Chisholm, J.S.

On this run, the community uses humor and laughter with each other, without directly including the child\u2014who may not wish to get up early and run\u2014to encourage the child to participate and become an active member of the community.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" /> Parents also promote participation in the morning runs by placing their child in the snow and having them stay longer if they protest.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" />[[File:Indians of Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico, making pottery, 1916 - NARA - 519165.jpg|thumb|Indians of Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico, making pottery, 1916]]\n\nIndigenous American parents often [[Child integration|incorporate children]] into everyday life, including adult activities, allowing the child to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn through observation]].

Although this is an exception to their cultural preference for incorporating children into activities, including cooking, it is a strong example of observational learning. Mayan girls can only watch their mothers making tortillas for a few minutes at a time, but the sacredness of the activity captures their interest. They will then go and practice the movements their mother used on other objects, such as kneading thin pieces of plastic like a tortilla. From this practice, when a girl comes of age, she is able to sit down and make tortillas without having ever received any explicit verbal instruction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaskins|first1=Suzanne|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|editor1-last=Lancy|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Bock|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Gaskins|editor3-first=Suzanne|title=The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood|date=2010|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=United Kingdom|chapter=Learning Through Observation in Daily Life}}</ref>\n\n==Across the lifespan==\n\n===Pre-pregnancy===\n{{Main|Family planning|Prenatal care}}\n[[Family planning]] is the decision-making process surrounding whether and when to become parents, including planning, preparing, and gathering resources.

A newborn's basic needs are food, sleep, comfort and cleaning which the parent provides. An infant's only form of communication is crying, and attentive parents will begin to recognize different types of [[crying]] which represent different needs such as hunger, discomfort, boredom, or loneliness. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours which is disruptive to adult [[Sleep cycle#Stages of sleep|sleep cycles]]. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling and caressing. Gentle rocking back and forth often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or a [[pacifier]]. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. [[Breastfeeding]] is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations.<ref name=\"AAP_Policy\">{{cite journal | title=Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk | author=Gartner LM |author2=Morton J |author3=Lawrence RA |author4=Naylor AJ |author5=O'Hare D |author6=Schanler RJ |author7=Eidelman AI | journal=Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue=2 |date=February 2005 | pages=496\u2013506 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2491 | pmid=15687461|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref> If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative.

Attachment is not the same as love or affection, although they often go together. Attachments develop immediately and a lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted attachment can potentially do serious damage to a child's health and well-being. Physically, one may not see symptoms or indications of a disorder but the child may be emotionally affected. Studies show that children with secure attachment have the ability to form successful relationships, express themselves on an interpersonal basis and have higher self-esteem {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the [[toddler]] to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette such as being polite and taking turns.<ref>https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/manners/teaching-kids-to-mind-their-manners/</ref>[[File:Parenting.JPG|thumb|A father and daughter in [[Trivandrum]], [[India]]|left]]Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and eager to explore it.

[[Tantrum]]s begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the 'Terrible Twos'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safekids.co.uk/terrible-twos-explained.html |title=The Terrible Twos Explained - Safe Kids (UK) |publisher=Safe Kids |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> Tantrums are often caused by the child's frustration over the particular situation, sometimes simply not being able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child's responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often behave badly with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors, giving threats or punishments is not helpful and will only make the situation worse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pitman|first=Teresa|title=Toddler Frustration|url=http://www.todaysparent.com/toddler/toddler-behaviour/toddler-frustration|publisher=Todaysparent|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>  Research groups led by [[Daniel Schechter]], Alytia Levendosky, and others have shown that parents with histories of maltreatment and violence exposure often have difficulty helping their toddlers and preschool-age children with these very same emotionally dysregulated behaviors, which can remind traumatized parents of their adverse experiences and associated mental states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schechter |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Willheim |first2=Erica |last3=Hinojosa |first3=Claudia |last4=Scholfield-Kleinman |first4=Kimberly |last5=Turner |first5=J.

Young children demand constant attention, but gradually learn how to deal with boredom and be able to play independently. They also enjoy helping and feeling useful and capable. Parents may assist their child by encouraging social interactions and modeling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties.

Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with \"[[rebellious]]\" [[teenager]]s who consistently push the limits. In order to prevent these issues, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved by planning and taking part in fun activities together, keeping promises made to the children, spending time with them, not reminding kids about their past mistakes and listening to and talking to them.\n\nWhen a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping the children build a strong foundation will help them resist negative peer pressure.\n\n===Adults===\nParenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood. Parenting can be a lifelong process.\n\nParents may provide financial support to their adult children, which can also include providing an inheritance after death.

Treaties from the 15th century between the [[Livonian Order]] and Novgorod Republic also recognize the Narva as the border.<ref name=selart/> During the time of [[Swedish Estonia]], when [[Ingria]] was also part of Sweden, the importance of the river as a border diminished. During the [[Russian Empire]], from the end of the [[Great Northern War]] until the establishment of the [[History of Estonia#Republic of Estonia|Republic of Estonia]] in 1918, the Narva was the border of [[Governorate of Estonia]] and [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]], with the exception of the town of Narva, which was part of the latter.

In 1944 the former Estonian territory east of the river was transferred to [[Russian SFSR]] and the Narva was thus established as the eastern border of [[Estonian SSR]], an internal border within [[USSR]].

Beginning in the 13th century it was the border of [[Medieval Livonia]] and the [[Novgorod Republic]].<ref name=selart>{{cite journal |last=Selart |first=Anti |authorlink=Anti Selart |year=1996 |title=Narva j\u00f5gi - Virumaa idapiir keskajal |journal=Akadeemia |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |language=et}}</ref> Though in earlier periods Narva was part of a larger buffer zone between the two territories, gradually the river emerged as the exact border.<ref name=selart/> Castles built on the river banks (Narva [[Hermann Castle]], founded at the beginning of the 14th century, [[Ivangorod fortress]], established in 1492 and Vasknarva Castle, first built in the 14th century) were one of the main reasons behind this. Treaties from the 15th century between the [[Livonian Order]] and Novgorod Republic also recognize the Narva as the border.<ref name=selart/> During the time of [[Swedish Estonia]], when [[Ingria]] was also part of Sweden, the importance of the river as a border diminished. During the [[Russian Empire]], from the end of the [[Great Northern War]] until the establishment of the [[History of Estonia#Republic of Estonia|Republic of Estonia]] in 1918, the Narva was the border of [[Governorate of Estonia]] and [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]], with the exception of the town of Narva, which was part of the latter. By the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], signed in 1920, the Estonian\u2013[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] border went slightly east of the river, up to {{convert|10|km|mi|0}}, and, in particular, the town of Ivangorod was assigned to Estonia. In 1944 the former Estonian territory east of the river was transferred to [[Russian SFSR]] and the Narva was thus established as the eastern border of [[Estonian SSR]], an internal border within [[USSR]]. In 1991 the same border became the ''de facto'' border of Estonia and Russia. Although no official border treaty has been ratified since then,<ref>{{cite news |title=Russian-Estonian border agreement will be ratified |work=New Europe |date=22 September 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2009 |url=http://www.neurope.eu/articles/78037.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032446/http://www.neurope.eu/articles/78037.php |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> today the Narva is the eastern border of the [[European Union]] and [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen Zone]].\n\n===Bridges===\n[[File:Narva highway bridge.jpg|thumb|right| Tallinn-St. Petersburg highway bridge]]\nThe Narva river is crossed only by a handful of bridges between Narva and Ivangorod.
