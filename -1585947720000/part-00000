It borders the states of [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[New Hampshire]] to the east, and [[New York (state)|New York]] to the west, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] to the north. Vermont is the only state in New England that does not border the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Vermont is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|second-smallest by population]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|sixth-smallest by area]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 U.S. states]]. The [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], the [[List of capitals in the United States|least populous state capital]] in the United States. The most populous city, [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], is the [[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population|least populous city]] to be the most populous city in a state. \n\nFor some 12,000 years, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited this area. The historically competitive tribes of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Abenaki]] and Iroquoian-speaking [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] were active in the area at the time of European encounter.\n\nDuring the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the [[Kingdom of France]]'s colony of [[New France]]. After the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. For years, each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding and warfare between the New England and New France colonies. This produced an active trade in captives taken during such raids, often held for ransom, although some captives were adopted by families into the Mohawk or Abenaki tribes.\n\nAfter being defeated in 1763 in the [[Seven Years' War]], France ceded its territory east of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Thereafter, the nearby British [[Thirteen Colonies]], especially the provinces of [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of New York|New York]], disputed the extent of the area called the [[New Hampshire Grants]] to the west of the [[Connecticut River]], encompassing present-day Vermont. The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. The [[Green Mountain Boys]] militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly-arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York.\n\nUltimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the [[Vermont Republic]] in 1777 as an independent state during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Vermont Republic [[history of slavery in Vermont|abolished slavery]] before any of the other states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vermont Constitution of 1777|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state-archives/government-history/vermont-constitutions/1777-constitution.aspx|publisher=State of Vermont|accessdate=April 12, 2019|location=Chapter I, Section I|quote=Therefore, no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person, as a servant, slave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years, unless they are bound by their own consent, after they arrive to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Lee Ann| last=Cox| title=Patchwork Freedom |url=https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/patchwork-freedom |publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=|date =29 January 2014}}</ref> Vermont was also the first state to produce an African-American university graduate, [[Alexander Twilight]], in 1823.\n\nVermont was [[admission to the Union|admitted]] to the newly established [[United States#Independence and expansion (1776\u20131865)|United States]] as the fourteenth state in 1791. Vermont is one of the four U.S. states that were previously [[sovereign state]]s (along with [[Republic of Texas|Texas]], [[California Republic|California]], and [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]]).\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment, although it was also tied to [[King Cotton]] through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the [[American Civil War]]. In the 21st century, [[Protestant]]s (30%) and [[Catholic]]s (22%) make up the majority of those reporting a religious preference, with 37% reporting no religion, the highest rate of [[Atheism|irreligion]] of all states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion & Public Life |date=May 12, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref> Other religions individually contribute no more than two percent to the total.\n\nThe geography of the state is marked by the [[Green Mountains]], which run north\u2013south up the middle of the state, separating [[Lake Champlain]] and other valley terrain on the west from the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River valley]] that defines much of its eastern border. A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.\n\nVermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked 52nd on the [[list of U.S. states and territories by GDP]] (every state plus [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Puerto Rico]] were larger), but 34th in GDP per capita. In 1960, Vermonters' politics started to shift from being reliably Republican toward favoring Democratic candidates. Starting in 1963, Vermont voters have alternated between electing Republican and Democratic governors. Since 2007, Vermont has elected only Democrats and Independents to Congress. In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples. In 2011\u20132012, the state officially recognized four Abenaki tribes.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[Samuel de Champlain]] claimed the area around what is now [[Lake Champlain]], giving the name, ''Verd Mont'' (Green Mountain) to the region he found, on a 1647 map.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfhrDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=Champlain+map+1647+%22Verd+mont%22&source=bl&ots=B8JEB1XN-R&sig=ACfU3U0EcUBl_Q1UDGr_YuB9y9JcGKztVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4qaz3vKnnAhWigXIEHbjmAAYQ6AEwHHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=Champlain%20map%201647%20%22Verd%20mont%22&f=false|title=New England Rocks: Historic Geological Wonders|last=Conway|first=Michael J.

In the mid-20th century, descendants began to reclaim their French names, especially surnames.\n\nBeginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont industries attracted numerous [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[immigrants]], adding to its residents of mostly [[English Americans|English]] and some [[Quebec diaspora#United States|French-Canadian]] ancestry. Many of the immigrants migrated to [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]], where the men worked as stonecutters of [[granite]], for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states.\n\nIn this period, many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses to support their families. Such facilities also helped absorb new residents and help them learn the new culture; European immigrants peaked in number between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.<ref name=\"barre\">{{cite web|url=http://vermonthistory.org/journal/74/05_Richards.pdf |author=Susan Richards| title=Making Home Pay: Italian and Scottish Boardinghouse Keepers in Barre, 1880\u20131910| work=Vermont History Journal |date=2005 |access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGradually the new immigrants were absorbed into the state. Times of tension aroused divisions. In the early 20th century, some people in Vermont became alarmed about what they considered to be a decline in rural areas; people left farming to move to cities and others seemed unable to fit within society. In addition, there was a wave of immigration by French Canadians, and those of Protestant Yankee stock feared being overtaken by the new people, who added to the Catholic population of Irish and Italians. Based on the colonial past, some Yankee residents considered the French Canadians to have intermarried too frequently with Native Americans.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn an era influenced by ideas of [[Social Darwinism]], some Vermont leaders promoted [[eugenics]], an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective. It passed a marriage law, to limit marriage by people considered unfit. In 1915 the [[Brandon State School for the Feebleminded]] opened, the beginning of a related effort to segregate and control those judged unfit to reproduce.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nThe state followed efforts to improve children's welfare by establishing other institutions to house the mentally ill or disabled. From 1925\u20131928 the [[Eugenics Survey of Vermont]] conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent. It also attempted to educate the public about why restrictive measures, including voluntary sterilization, were desirable. Review by current historians reveals the results were socially prejudiced, as the surveys tended to target the poor and disenfranchised minorities, including French Canadians, Abenaki, and disabled.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. Vermont like other states, sterilized some patients in institutions and persons it had identified through surveys as degenerate or unfit. It nominally had permission from the patients or their guardians, but abuses have been documented. Two-thirds of the sterilizations were done on women, and poor, unwed mothers were targeted, among others. The surgery was performed at institutions and hospitals in the state supposedly devoted to care of people in need. There is disagreement about how many sterilizations were performed; most were completed from 1931 to 1941, but such procedures were recorded as late as 1970.<ref name=\"VT.ster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html |title=Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States: Vermont|author=Lutz Kaelber |publisher=University of Vermont|date=2009|access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Natural disasters====\n\nIn addition to the increased intensity and flooding caused by [[Global warming|climate change]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://climatechange.vermont.gov/|title=Climate Change in Vermont {{!}} Climate Change in Vermont|website=climatechange.vermont.gov|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> the state has suffered several extreme natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, and extensive rain and flooding.\n\nLarge-scale [[flooding]] occurred in early November 1927.

Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited [[suffrage]]. They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races.\n\nIn 1964, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' required \"[[one man, one vote]]\" redistricting in all states. It had found that many state legislatures had not redistricted and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated and industrial urban areas. In addition, it found that many states had an upper house based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties. This gave disproportionate power to rural and lightly populated counties. The court ruled there was no basis for such a structure. Major changes in political apportionment took place in Vermont and other affected states.\n\nThis ruling required districts to be reassessed after every census and to be based on roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties). Under redistricting, residents in urban areas were to gain an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont and some other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years, who had not redistricted since the turn of the century.<ref name = Udall>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/88th/641014.html |website=Congressman's Report |first=Morris K. |last=Udall |title=Reapportionment\u2014I \"One Man, One Vote\" . . .

This arrangement had meant that urban areas did not have proportionate political power and often suffered from underinvestment in needed infrastructure; other urban issues were also neglected by rural-dominated legislatures.<ref name = Udall/>\n\nIn July 2000, Vermont became the first state to introduce [[civil union]]s.

Before the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay, and people began to move out to newer suburbs.\n\nVermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party. Ethno-political culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout in the Green Mountain State. Since 1992, Vermont has voted for the Democrat in every Presidential election. Before 1992, Vermont voted for the Republican in every single Presidential election with the exception of 1964.<ref>Changing Patterns of Voting in the Northern United States: Electoral Realignment, 1952\u20131996 page 45 \"historian Charles Morrissey has noted that Canadian support for the democratic party{{nbsp}}...\" \"Table 3.5 Frenchest towns were most Democrat voting towns\" Page 50, table 3.6 also shows towns with highest portion of French ancestry have highest portion of Democrat voters, highest portion of English ancestry corresponds with highest portion of Republican voters</ref><ref>The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History.

As a result, urban areas in Vermont gained political power.\n\nThe legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote in the 1960s. It passed the Land Use and Development Law ([[Act 250 (Vermont law)|Act 250]]) in 1970 to discourage suburban sprawl and to limit major growth to already developed areas. The law, the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions appointed by the Governor, who judged land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities. As a result of Act 250, Vermont was the last state to get a [[Wal-Mart]] (there are now six Wal-Marts in the state, as of November 2017, but only three\u2014in Williston, St. Albans, and Derby\u2014were newly built from the ground up).

In ''[[Baker v.

The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of [[civil union]]; the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor [[Howard Dean]].

It borders the states of [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[New Hampshire]] to the east, and [[New York (state)|New York]] to the west, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] to the north. Vermont is the only state in New England that does not border the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Vermont is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|second-smallest by population]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|sixth-smallest by area]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 U.S. states]]. The [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], the [[List of capitals in the United States|least populous state capital]] in the United States. The most populous city, [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], is the [[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population|least populous city]] to be the most populous city in a state. \n\nFor some 12,000 years, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited this area. The historically competitive tribes of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Abenaki]] and Iroquoian-speaking [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] were active in the area at the time of European encounter.\n\nDuring the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the [[Kingdom of France]]'s colony of [[New France]]. After the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. For years, each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding and warfare between the New England and New France colonies. This produced an active trade in captives taken during such raids, often held for ransom, although some captives were adopted by families into the Mohawk or Abenaki tribes.\n\nAfter being defeated in 1763 in the [[Seven Years' War]], France ceded its territory east of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Thereafter, the nearby British [[Thirteen Colonies]], especially the provinces of [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of New York|New York]], disputed the extent of the area called the [[New Hampshire Grants]] to the west of the [[Connecticut River]], encompassing present-day Vermont. The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. The [[Green Mountain Boys]] militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly-arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York.\n\nUltimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the [[Vermont Republic]] in 1777 as an independent state during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Vermont Republic [[history of slavery in Vermont|abolished slavery]] before any of the other states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vermont Constitution of 1777|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state-archives/government-history/vermont-constitutions/1777-constitution.aspx|publisher=State of Vermont|accessdate=April 12, 2019|location=Chapter I, Section I|quote=Therefore, no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person, as a servant, slave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years, unless they are bound by their own consent, after they arrive to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Lee Ann| last=Cox| title=Patchwork Freedom |url=https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/patchwork-freedom |publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=|date =29 January 2014}}</ref> Vermont was also the first state to produce an African-American university graduate, [[Alexander Twilight]], in 1823.\n\nVermont was [[admission to the Union|admitted]] to the newly established [[United States#Independence and expansion (1776\u20131865)|United States]] as the fourteenth state in 1791. Vermont is one of the four U.S. states that were previously [[sovereign state]]s (along with [[Republic of Texas|Texas]], [[California Republic|California]], and [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]]).\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment, although it was also tied to [[King Cotton]] through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the [[American Civil War]].

A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.\n\nVermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked 52nd on the [[list of U.S. states and territories by GDP]] (every state plus [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Puerto Rico]] were larger), but 34th in GDP per capita. In 1960, Vermonters' politics started to shift from being reliably Republican toward favoring Democratic candidates. Starting in 1963, Vermont voters have alternated between electing Republican and Democratic governors. Since 2007, Vermont has elected only Democrats and Independents to Congress. In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples. In 2011\u20132012, the state officially recognized four Abenaki tribes.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[Samuel de Champlain]] claimed the area around what is now [[Lake Champlain]], giving the name, ''Verd Mont'' (Green Mountain) to the region he found, on a 1647 map.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfhrDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=Champlain+map+1647+%22Verd+mont%22&source=bl&ots=B8JEB1XN-R&sig=ACfU3U0EcUBl_Q1UDGr_YuB9y9JcGKztVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4qaz3vKnnAhWigXIEHbjmAAYQ6AEwHHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=Champlain%20map%201647%20%22Verd%20mont%22&f=false|title=New England Rocks: Historic Geological Wonders|last=Conway|first=Michael J.

In the mid-20th century, descendants began to reclaim their French names, especially surnames.\n\nBeginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont industries attracted numerous [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[immigrants]], adding to its residents of mostly [[English Americans|English]] and some [[Quebec diaspora#United States|French-Canadian]] ancestry. Many of the immigrants migrated to [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]], where the men worked as stonecutters of [[granite]], for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states.\n\nIn this period, many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses to support their families. Such facilities also helped absorb new residents and help them learn the new culture; European immigrants peaked in number between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.<ref name=\"barre\">{{cite web|url=http://vermonthistory.org/journal/74/05_Richards.pdf |author=Susan Richards| title=Making Home Pay: Italian and Scottish Boardinghouse Keepers in Barre, 1880\u20131910| work=Vermont History Journal |date=2005 |access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGradually the new immigrants were absorbed into the state. Times of tension aroused divisions. In the early 20th century, some people in Vermont became alarmed about what they considered to be a decline in rural areas; people left farming to move to cities and others seemed unable to fit within society. In addition, there was a wave of immigration by French Canadians, and those of Protestant Yankee stock feared being overtaken by the new people, who added to the Catholic population of Irish and Italians. Based on the colonial past, some Yankee residents considered the French Canadians to have intermarried too frequently with Native Americans.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn an era influenced by ideas of [[Social Darwinism]], some Vermont leaders promoted [[eugenics]], an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective. It passed a marriage law, to limit marriage by people considered unfit. In 1915 the [[Brandon State School for the Feebleminded]] opened, the beginning of a related effort to segregate and control those judged unfit to reproduce.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nThe state followed efforts to improve children's welfare by establishing other institutions to house the mentally ill or disabled. From 1925\u20131928 the [[Eugenics Survey of Vermont]] conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent. It also attempted to educate the public about why restrictive measures, including voluntary sterilization, were desirable. Review by current historians reveals the results were socially prejudiced, as the surveys tended to target the poor and disenfranchised minorities, including French Canadians, Abenaki, and disabled.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. Vermont like other states, sterilized some patients in institutions and persons it had identified through surveys as degenerate or unfit. It nominally had permission from the patients or their guardians, but abuses have been documented. Two-thirds of the sterilizations were done on women, and poor, unwed mothers were targeted, among others. The surgery was performed at institutions and hospitals in the state supposedly devoted to care of people in need. There is disagreement about how many sterilizations were performed; most were completed from 1931 to 1941, but such procedures were recorded as late as 1970.<ref name=\"VT.ster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html |title=Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States: Vermont|author=Lutz Kaelber |publisher=University of Vermont|date=2009|access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Natural disasters====\n\nIn addition to the increased intensity and flooding caused by [[Global warming|climate change]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://climatechange.vermont.gov/|title=Climate Change in Vermont {{!}} Climate Change in Vermont|website=climatechange.vermont.gov|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> the state has suffered several extreme natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, and extensive rain and flooding.\n\nLarge-scale [[flooding]] occurred in early November 1927.

Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited [[suffrage]]. They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races.\n\nIn 1964, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' required \"[[one man, one vote]]\" redistricting in all states. It had found that many state legislatures had not redistricted and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated and industrial urban areas. In addition, it found that many states had an upper house based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties. This gave disproportionate power to rural and lightly populated counties. The court ruled there was no basis for such a structure. Major changes in political apportionment took place in Vermont and other affected states.\n\nThis ruling required districts to be reassessed after every census and to be based on roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties). Under redistricting, residents in urban areas were to gain an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont and some other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years, who had not redistricted since the turn of the century.<ref name = Udall>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/88th/641014.html |website=Congressman's Report |first=Morris K. |last=Udall |title=Reapportionment\u2014I \"One Man, One Vote\" . . .

This arrangement had meant that urban areas did not have proportionate political power and often suffered from underinvestment in needed infrastructure; other urban issues were also neglected by rural-dominated legislatures.<ref name = Udall/>\n\nIn July 2000, Vermont became the first state to introduce [[civil union]]s. In 2009, Vermont became the first state to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], unforced by court challenge or ruling.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vermont Legislature Makes Same-Sex Marriage Legal|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 7, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/us/08vermont.html | first=Abby | last=Goodnough | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince the late 20th century, Abenaki peoples in Vermont lobbied for recognition.

Before the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay, and people began to move out to newer suburbs.\n\nVermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party. Ethno-political culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout in the Green Mountain State. Since 1992, Vermont has voted for the Democrat in every Presidential election. Before 1992, Vermont voted for the Republican in every single Presidential election with the exception of 1964.<ref>Changing Patterns of Voting in the Northern United States: Electoral Realignment, 1952\u20131996 page 45 \"historian Charles Morrissey has noted that Canadian support for the democratic party{{nbsp}}...\" \"Table 3.5 Frenchest towns were most Democrat voting towns\" Page 50, table 3.6 also shows towns with highest portion of French ancestry have highest portion of Democrat voters, highest portion of English ancestry corresponds with highest portion of Republican voters</ref><ref>The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History.

As a result, urban areas in Vermont gained political power.\n\nThe legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote in the 1960s. It passed the Land Use and Development Law ([[Act 250 (Vermont law)|Act 250]]) in 1970 to discourage suburban sprawl and to limit major growth to already developed areas. The law, the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions appointed by the Governor, who judged land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities. As a result of Act 250, Vermont was the last state to get a [[Wal-Mart]] (there are now six Wal-Marts in the state, as of November 2017, but only three\u2014in Williston, St. Albans, and Derby\u2014were newly built from the ground up).

In ''[[Baker v.

The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of [[civil union]]; the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor [[Howard Dean]].
