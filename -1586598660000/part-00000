For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.<ref>{{citeplato|Timaeus|24e\u201325a}}, [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.

Bury]] translation (Loeb Classical Library).</ref>}}\n\nThe four people appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians [[Critias]] and [[Hermocrates]] as well as the philosophers [[Socrates]] and [[Timaeus of Locri]], although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic method]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.\n\nThe ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical, that would make the perfect example, and he then follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the \"perfect society\" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the \"perfect\" traits described in the ''Republic''.\n\n===''Critias''===\n{{main|Critias (dialogue)}}\n\nAccording to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis\u2014Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com}}</ref><ref>Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report, accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for \"bigger than\" (\"meson\") and \"between\" (\"mezon\") \u2013 {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis \u2013 New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}</ref> but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. Plato asserted that the Egyptians described Atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south \"extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi].\" Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&nbsp;... broke it off all round about&nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].\n\nIn Plato's metaphorical tale, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas of Atlantis|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of Hercules.<ref>The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].</ref> The other four pairs of twins\u2014Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes\u2014were also given \"rule over many men, and a large territory.\"\n\nPoseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city.

The mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in Greece, the largest in the [[Peloponnese]], and that gulf opens onto the Mediterranean Sea. If from the beginning of discussions, misinterpretation of Gibraltar as the location rather than being at the Gulf of Laconia, would lend itself to many erroneous concepts regarding the location of Atlantis. Plato may have not been aware of the difference. The Laconian pillars open to the south toward Crete and beyond which is Egypt. The [[Thera eruption]] and the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] affected that area and might have been the devastation to which the sources used by Plato referred. Significant events such as these would have been likely material for tales passed from one generation to another for almost a thousand years.\n\n===In the Atlantic Ocean===\nThe location of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names.

Writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between [[Silenus]] and King [[Midas]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2}}, \"Pious-town\") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Fighting-town\"). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer [[Hyperborea]], but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-G\u00fcnther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, by parody, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.<ref>[[Heinz-G\u00fcnther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (1998).

Thomas Heyrick (1649-1694) followed him with \"The New Atlantis\" (1687), a satirical poem in three parts. His new continent of uncertain location, perhaps even a floating island either in the sea or the sky, serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as \"A True Character of Popery and Jesuitism\".<ref>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43565.0001.001?view=toc University of Michigan]</ref>\n\nThe title of ''[[The New Atalantis]]'' by [[Delarivier Manley]] (1709), distinguished from the two others by the single letter, is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional Mediterranean island.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/secretmemoirsman00manl#page/n5/mode/2up Archived online]</ref> In it sexual violence and exploitation is made a metaphor for the hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public.<ref>Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, So\u0148a, [http://www.phil.muni.cz/angl/thepes/thepes_02_17.pdf pp.121-6 \"Sex and Politics: Delarivier Manley's New Atalantis\"]</ref> In Manley's case, the target of satire was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]], while in David Maclean Parry's ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]'' (1906) it is [[Socialism]] as practised in foundered Atlantis.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t3vt2bh65;view=1up;seq=7 Online edition]</ref> It was followed in Russia by [[Velemir Khlebnikov]]'s poem ''The Fall of Atlantis'' (''Gibel' Atlantidy'', 1912), which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past. When the high priest of this ideology is tempted by a slave girl into an act of irrationality, he murders her and precipitates a second flood, above which her severed head floats vengefully among the stars.<ref>Boris Thomson, ''Lot's Wife and the Venus of Milo: Conflicting Attitudes to the Cultural Heritage in Modern Russia'', Cambridge University 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3UTbrInnAoC&pg=PA77 pp.77\u20138]</ref>\n\nA slightly later work, ''The Ancient of Atlantis'' (Boston, 1915) by Albert Armstrong Manship, expounds the Atlantean wisdom that is to redeem the earth. Its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an Atlantean wise one, followed by his Utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost wisdom is reborn on earth.<ref>Archived [https://archive.org/stream/ancientatlantis00mansgoog#page/n15/mode/2up online]</ref>\n\nIn [[Hispanic]] eyes, Atlantis had a more intimate interpretation. The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This was the point of view of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]'s vast mythological epic ''L'Atlantida'' (1877).  After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of [[Barcelona]] and then departs westward again to the [[Hesperides]]. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so \"call the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old\". This mariner, of course, was [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>Robert Hughes, ''Barcelona'', London 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=Atlantida+%22poem%22#v=onepage&q=Atlantida%20%22poem%22 pp.341-3]</ref>\n \nVerdaguer's poem was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], but was widely translated in both Europe and Hispano-America.<ref>Isidor C\u00f2nsul, [http://www.visat.cat/traduccions-literatura-catalana/eng/ressenyes/85/122/0/3/poesia/jacint-verdaguer.html \"The translations of Verdaguer]</ref> One response was the similarly entitled Argentinian ''Atlantida'' of [[Olegario Victor Andrade]] (1881), which sees in \"Enchanted Atlantis that Plato foresaw, a golden promise to the fruitful race\" of Latins.<ref>''Obras Poeticas'', [https://archive.org/stream/3202277#page/151/mode/2up/search/atlantida pp.151-166]; there is a translation of canto 8 by [http://www.poetrynook.com/poem/atl%E2%94%9C%C3%ADntida Elijah Clarence Hills]</ref> The bad example of the colonising world remains, however. [[Jose Juan Tablada]] characterises its threat in his \"De Atl\u00e1ntida\" (1894) through the beguiling picture of the lost world populated by the underwater creatures of Classical myth, among whom is the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] of its final stanza with \n::her eye on the keel of the wandering vessel \n::that in passing deflowers the sea's smooth mirror,\n::launching into the night her amorous warbling\n::and the dulcet lullaby of her treacherous voice!<ref>Latin American Anthology, [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/friedrich.frosch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/anthologie-poes%C3%ADa-latinoamericana-siglo-XX.pdf p.1]</ref>\n   \nThere is a similar ambivalence in [[Janus Djurhuus]]' six-stanza \"Atlantis\" (1917), where a celebration of the [[Faroese language conflict|Faroese linguistic revival]] grants it an ancient pedigree by linking Greek to Norse legend. In the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of Classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of Atlantis. The poet recalls \"that the Faroes lie there in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,\" but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Joensen |first=Leyvoy |title=Atlantis, B\u00e1bylon, T\u00f3rshavn: The Djurhuus Brothers and William Heinesen in Faroese Literary History |journal=Scandinavian Studies |volume=74 |issue=2 |year=2002 |jstor=40920372 |pages=181\u2013204 [esp. 192\u20134] }}</ref>\n\n===A land lost in the distance===\n[[File:Faroe stamp 493 Djurhuus poems - atlantis.jpg|thumb|A Faroe Islands postage stamp honoring [[Janus Djurhuus]]' \"Atlantis\" ]]\n\nThe fact that Atlantis is a lost land has made of it a metaphor for something no longer attainable. For the American poet Edith Willis Linn Forbes (1865-1945), \"The Lost Atlantis\" stands for idealisation of the past; the present moment can only be treasured once that is realised.<ref>[http://www.blackcatpoems.com/f/the_lost_atlantis.html Black Cat poems]</ref> [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]] finds the location of \"The Lost Land\" (1910) in one's carefree youthful past.<ref>[http://www.litscape.com/author/Ella_Wheeler_Wilcox/The_Lost_Land.html  Litscape]</ref> Similarly, for the Irish poet [[Eavan Boland]] in \"Atlantis, a lost sonnet\" (2007), the idea was defined when \"the old fable-makers searched hard for a word/ to convey that what is gone is gone forever\".<ref>[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/atlantis%E2%80%94-lost-sonnet Poets.org]</ref>\n\nFor some male poets too, the idea of Atlantis is constructed from what cannot be obtained. [[Charles Bewley]] in his [[Newdigate Prize]] poem (1910) thinks it grows from dissatisfaction with one's condition, \n::And, because life is partly sweet \n::And ever girt about with pain, \n::We take the sweetness, and are fain \n::To set it free from grief's alloy\nin a dream of Atlantis.<ref>Google Books [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/charles-bewley/atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe/1-atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe.shtml p.11]</ref> Similarly for the Australian [[Gary Catalano]] in a 1982 prose poem, it is \"a vision that sank under the weight of its own perfection\".<ref>Gary Catalano, Heaven of Rags, Sydney 1982, [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/catalano-gary/atlantis-0359028 Australian Poetry Library]</ref> [[W.

Two of them report the disaster that overtook the continent as related by long-lived survivors. In [[Frederick Tennyson]]'s ''Atlantis'' (1888) an ancient Greek mariner sails west and discovers an inhabited island, which is all that remains of the former kingdom. He learns of its end and views the shattered remnant of its former glory, from which a few had escaped to set up the Mediterranean civilisations.<ref>In two parts at Black Cat Poems; [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_i.html part 1] and [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_ii.html part 2]</ref> In the second, ''Mona, Queen of Lost Atlantis: An Idyllic Re-embodiment of Long Forgotten History'' (Los Angeles CA 1925) by James Logue Dryden (1840-1925), the story is told in a series of visions. A Seer is taken to Mona's burial chamber in the ruins of Atlantis, where she revives and describes the catastrophe. There follows a survey of the lost civilisations of Hyperborea and Lemuria as well as Atlantis, accompanied by much spiritualist lore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ3eIcpA4coC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Google Books]</ref>\n\nWilliam Walton Hoskins (1856-1919) admits to the readers of his ''Atlantis and other poems'' (Cleveland OH, 1881), that he is only 24.

It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.<ref>{{cite document |first=Pamela |last=Davidson |title=Cultural Memory and Survival: The Russian Renaissance of Classical Antiquity in the Twentieth Century |series=Studies in Russia and Eastern Europe |volume=6 |publisher=School of Slavonic and East European Studies, UCL |location=London, UK |year=2009 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/69111 |pages=5\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nSculptures referencing Atlantis have often been stylized single figures.

For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent.

In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic method]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.\n\nThe ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical, that would make the perfect example, and he then follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the \"perfect society\" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the \"perfect\" traits described in the ''Republic''.\n\n===''Critias''===\n{{main|Critias (dialogue)}}\n\nAccording to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis\u2014Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com}}</ref><ref>Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report, accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for \"bigger than\" (\"meson\") and \"between\" (\"mezon\") \u2013 {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis \u2013 New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}</ref> but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. Plato asserted that the Egyptians described Atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south \"extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi].\" Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&nbsp;... broke it off all round about&nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].\n\nIn Plato's metaphorical tale, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas of Atlantis|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of Hercules.<ref>The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].</ref> The other four pairs of twins\u2014Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes\u2014were also given \"rule over many men, and a large territory.\"\n\nPoseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city. The walls were constructed of red, white, and black rock, quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]], and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.\n\nAccording to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules, as far as Egypt, and the European continent as far as [[Tyrrhenia]], and had subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.\n\n{{quote|But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.

Some have understood Ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of Atlantis's sinking into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus, in fact, says that \"the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the [[Rhine]]\" (''Res Gestae'' 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north (Britain, the Netherlands, or Germany), not from a theorized location in the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west.<ref>Fitzpatrick-Matthews, Keith.

The [[Europeans]] believed the [[indigenous people]] to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in ruins and by sharing a common history, they insinuate that another race must have been responsible.\n\nIn the middle and late nineteenth century, several renowned [[Mesoamerica]]n scholars, starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], formally proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to Mayan and [[Aztec]] culture.\n\nThe French scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg traveled extensively through Mesoamerica in the mid-1800s, and was renowned for his translations of [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] texts, most notably the sacred book [[Popol Vuh]], as well as a comprehensive history of the region. Soon after these publications, however, Brasseur de Bourbourg lost his academic credibility, due to his claim that the [[Maya peoples]] had descended from the [[Toltecs]], people he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior civilization of Atlantis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Evans, R.

Blavatsky and her followers in this group are often cited as the founders of [[New Age]] and other spiritual movements.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBlavatsky took up [[Donnelly]]'s interpretations when she wrote ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), which she claimed was originally dictated in Atlantis. She maintained that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to [[Plato]], who describes them mainly as a military threat). She believed in a form of racial [[evolution]] (as opposed to primate evolution), in which the Atlanteans were the fourth \"[[Root Race]]\", succeeded by the fifth and most superior \"[[Aryan race]]\" (the modern human race).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The [[Theosophists]] believed that the civilization of Atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, but destroyed itself through internal [[warfare]] brought about by the dangerous use of [[psychic]] and [[supernatural]] powers of the inhabitants. [[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[anthroposophy]] and [[Waldorf Schools]], along with other well known Theosophists, such as [[Annie Besant]], also wrote of [[cultural]] evolution in much the same vein.\n\nSome subsequent occultists have followed Blavatsky, at least to the point of tracing the lineage of occult practices back to Atlantis.

The idea has inspired, however, the German anthropology professor [[Hans Peter Duerr]] to dive further into the history of the lost city of [[Rungholt]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]].\n\nThe idea of Atlantis as the homeland of the Caucasian race would contradict the beliefs of older Esoteric and Theosophic groups, which taught that the Atlanteans were non-Caucasian brown-skinned peoples.

Writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between [[Silenus]] and King [[Midas]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2}}, \"Pious-town\") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Fighting-town\"). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer [[Hyperborea]], but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-G\u00fcnther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, by parody, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.<ref>[[Heinz-G\u00fcnther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (1998).

Thomas Heyrick (1649-1694) followed him with \"The New Atlantis\" (1687), a satirical poem in three parts. His new continent of uncertain location, perhaps even a floating island either in the sea or the sky, serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as \"A True Character of Popery and Jesuitism\".<ref>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43565.0001.001?view=toc University of Michigan]</ref>\n\nThe title of ''[[The New Atalantis]]'' by [[Delarivier Manley]] (1709), distinguished from the two others by the single letter, is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional Mediterranean island.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/secretmemoirsman00manl#page/n5/mode/2up Archived online]</ref> In it sexual violence and exploitation is made a metaphor for the hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public.<ref>Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, So\u0148a, [http://www.phil.muni.cz/angl/thepes/thepes_02_17.pdf pp.121-6 \"Sex and Politics: Delarivier Manley's New Atalantis\"]</ref> In Manley's case, the target of satire was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]], while in David Maclean Parry's ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]'' (1906) it is [[Socialism]] as practised in foundered Atlantis.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t3vt2bh65;view=1up;seq=7 Online edition]</ref> It was followed in Russia by [[Velemir Khlebnikov]]'s poem ''The Fall of Atlantis'' (''Gibel' Atlantidy'', 1912), which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past. When the high priest of this ideology is tempted by a slave girl into an act of irrationality, he murders her and precipitates a second flood, above which her severed head floats vengefully among the stars.<ref>Boris Thomson, ''Lot's Wife and the Venus of Milo: Conflicting Attitudes to the Cultural Heritage in Modern Russia'', Cambridge University 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3UTbrInnAoC&pg=PA77 pp.77\u20138]</ref>\n\nA slightly later work, ''The Ancient of Atlantis'' (Boston, 1915) by Albert Armstrong Manship, expounds the Atlantean wisdom that is to redeem the earth. Its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an Atlantean wise one, followed by his Utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost wisdom is reborn on earth.<ref>Archived [https://archive.org/stream/ancientatlantis00mansgoog#page/n15/mode/2up online]</ref>\n\nIn [[Hispanic]] eyes, Atlantis had a more intimate interpretation. The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This was the point of view of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]'s vast mythological epic ''L'Atlantida'' (1877).  After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of [[Barcelona]] and then departs westward again to the [[Hesperides]]. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so \"call the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old\". This mariner, of course, was [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>Robert Hughes, ''Barcelona'', London 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=Atlantida+%22poem%22#v=onepage&q=Atlantida%20%22poem%22 pp.341-3]</ref>\n \nVerdaguer's poem was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], but was widely translated in both Europe and Hispano-America.<ref>Isidor C\u00f2nsul, [http://www.visat.cat/traduccions-literatura-catalana/eng/ressenyes/85/122/0/3/poesia/jacint-verdaguer.html \"The translations of Verdaguer]</ref> One response was the similarly entitled Argentinian ''Atlantida'' of [[Olegario Victor Andrade]] (1881), which sees in \"Enchanted Atlantis that Plato foresaw, a golden promise to the fruitful race\" of Latins.<ref>''Obras Poeticas'', [https://archive.org/stream/3202277#page/151/mode/2up/search/atlantida pp.151-166]; there is a translation of canto 8 by [http://www.poetrynook.com/poem/atl%E2%94%9C%C3%ADntida Elijah Clarence Hills]</ref> The bad example of the colonising world remains, however.

In the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of Classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of Atlantis. The poet recalls \"that the Faroes lie there in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,\" but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Joensen |first=Leyvoy |title=Atlantis, B\u00e1bylon, T\u00f3rshavn: The Djurhuus Brothers and William Heinesen in Faroese Literary History |journal=Scandinavian Studies |volume=74 |issue=2 |year=2002 |jstor=40920372 |pages=181\u2013204 [esp. 192\u20134] }}</ref>\n\n===A land lost in the distance===\n[[File:Faroe stamp 493 Djurhuus poems - atlantis.jpg|thumb|A Faroe Islands postage stamp honoring [[Janus Djurhuus]]' \"Atlantis\" ]]\n\nThe fact that Atlantis is a lost land has made of it a metaphor for something no longer attainable.

Two of them report the disaster that overtook the continent as related by long-lived survivors.

He learns of its end and views the shattered remnant of its former glory, from which a few had escaped to set up the Mediterranean civilisations.<ref>In two parts at Black Cat Poems; [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_i.html part 1] and [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_ii.html part 2]</ref> In the second, ''Mona, Queen of Lost Atlantis: An Idyllic Re-embodiment of Long Forgotten History'' (Los Angeles CA 1925) by James Logue Dryden (1840-1925), the story is told in a series of visions. A Seer is taken to Mona's burial chamber in the ruins of Atlantis, where she revives and describes the catastrophe.

In the seventeenth century there was [[Fran\u00e7ois de Nom\u00e9]]'s ''The Fall of Atlantis'', which shows a tidal wave surging toward a Baroque city frontage. The style of architecture apart, it is not very different from [[Nicholas Roerich]]'s ''The Last of Atlantis'' of 1928.<ref>[http://img.wikinut.com/img/32jflhip_8dkz5sr/jpeg/0/Gibel-Atlantidy-by-Nicholas-Roerich.jpeg Wikinut]</ref>\n\nThe most dramatic depiction of the catastrophe was [[Leon Bakst]]'s ''Ancient Terror'' (''Terror Antiquus'', 1908), although it does not name Atlantis directly. It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.<ref>{{cite document |first=Pamela |last=Davidson |title=Cultural Memory and Survival: The Russian Renaissance of Classical Antiquity in the Twentieth Century |series=Studies in Russia and Eastern Europe |volume=6 |publisher=School of Slavonic and East European Studies, UCL |location=London, UK |year=2009 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/69111 |pages=5\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nSculptures referencing Atlantis have often been stylized single figures.

As the [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House discussions]] were taking place, RSF attempted to annihilate this base,{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=110}} hoping to weaken the Zimbabwean position.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=114}}\n\nThe base was held by 6,000 ZANLA partisans, with many anti-aircraft weapons on hills. Many guns were located on the highest hill, later to be nicknamed \"Monte Cassino\".{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=110}} Two secondary hills, Hill 774 and Hill 761, were also dotted with anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=133}} Trenches were dug in the 64-square-kilometers surface of the camp.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=114}} The base was commanded by [[Solomon Mujuru]], known by his ''[[nom-de-guerre]]'' Rex Nhongo. <!--According to the , while scholar Blessing-Miles Tendi indicates t-->These weapons were received from the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Derg]].{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=111}}\n\nSmall-scale Rhodesian reconnaissances erroneously estimated the ZANLA force to be 2,000 men strong.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=114}} 200 Rhodesian soldiers were engaged. 100 men of the [[Selous Scouts]] were to spearhead the raid.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=114}} Each of the ten-men was transported in a Unimog truck. The whole column, commanded by captain Richard Passaportis,{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} contained 20 Unimogs, protected by [[Eland-90]] armored cars of the [[Rhodesian Armoured Corps]].{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=116}} A detachment of [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|QF 25-pounder]] guns was also part of the column.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} The Selous Scouts were supported by 100 men of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (2 Commando, 3 Commando and ''Support Commando''){{sfn|Wessels|Scheepers|2018|p=160}}), air-dropped 10-kilometers away from the camp.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=116}}\n\n== First day ==\nBefore attacking the base, the RSF ground forces had to cross a river. The artillery was bogged down and the guerilla was alerted of the size of the column.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} The column was further delayed by ZANLA fire.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=111}}{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} The first wave of the Selous Scouts began clearing the trenches but the rest of the column only arrive late in the afternoon.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} Meanwhile, the airdropped Rhodesian Light Infantry joined the battle and Mpunzarima, a key ZANLA military leader, was killed.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=111}} At dawn, Nhongo distributed [[marijuana]] to some of his troops, to reduce their stress.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}} The Rhodesian troops were harassed during the night by [[RPG-7]]s, [[recoilless-rifle]]s and [[mortars]].{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}}\n\n== Second day ==\nRSF renewed its assault. Nhongo personally went to the front to increase the moral of his troops, using a big stick to hit the reluctants.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}} Guided by a [[Westland Lynx]] helicopter, [[Hawker Hunter]] attack jets neutralized ZANLA fortifications in Hill 774. The position was taken at 3 pm by a troop of the Selous Scouts.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=133}} [[English Electric Canberra]] bombers also bombed the anti-aircraft positions.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=116}}\n\n== Third day ==\nDuring the night, RSF artillery fired at ZANLA positions, not to make damages but to prevent the partisans to rest.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}} At 10 am, two troops of Selous Scouts and a RLI section (around 100 men) led an assault to Monte Cassino. The summit was taken after the partisans had retreated, as was Hill 761.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} At the end of that day, Nhongo ordered his fighters to retreat{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=113}} During the late night, FRELIMO sent three or more [[T-34]] or [[T-54]] tanks{{sfn|Wessels|Scheepers|2018|p=160}}{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}}{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} and a squad of infantry to support the Rhodesian rebels but RSF 25-pounders quickly reacted, guided by [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]], and the tanks retreated after the lead tank was put out of action.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}}{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}}\n\n== Consequences ==\nThe Rhodesian force withdrew on the next morning,{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} taking captured equipment with them.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=135}}To avoid retaliation attacks from Mozambique, the Rhodesian Air Force bombed FRELIMO facilities but one Camberra and one Hunter were shut down.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} The battle had no consequences on the Lancaster House Discussion.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=110}} \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===External links===\n* {{cite web|first=Peter|last=Baxter|url=http://peterbaxterafrica.com/index.php/2012/10/20/selous-scouts-operation-miracle-26-september-1979/ |title=Selous Scouts Operation Miracle}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book |title=Rhodesian Air Force Operations with Air Strike Log |last=Geldenhuys |first=Preller |authorlink1=Preller Geldenhuys |location=Durban, South Africa |publisher=Just Done Productions Publishing  |isbn=978-1-920169-61-9 |date=13 July 2007 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tendi|first= Blessing-Miles|date=2020|title= The Longest Time.

When Claudette realizes Valentin has found her, she skips town, leaving Charlotte behind with Griffin. Valentin comes to town, and tells Griffin that he is Charlotte's father. Nathan also receives a note from Claudette, confirming that Valentin is Charlotte's father. Griffin petitions for custody of Charlotte; however, the judge grants full custody of Charlotte to Valentin. After Charlotte meets Lulu, she finds out the truth about Charlotte. Lulu petitions Valentin for custody, but Valentin is granted sole custody while Lulu is granted supervised weekly visits. Though Charlotte was distant from Lulu at first, the two started to grow closer. Months later, Valentin and Lulu now have shared custody of Charlotte.

Scared that he hurt Sam, Jake runs away on his bike and gets hit by a car. Jake survives, though, and is taken to a children's hospital, where he recovers from his injuries. Jake was unwittingly programmed by Helena. The programming came to fruition at the 2017 Nurses Ball. He received a magic kit from Helena's operatives thinking it was from Spencer. Inside was a dangerous chemical weapon created by the WSB known as the Chimera. He was allowed to do his magic routine after the Nurse's ball was over where he almost opened the chimera which would have exposed and killed all that attended. He was stopped by Drew, Elizabeth and [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] (who was the person who sold the Chimera to Helena).   \n{{clear}}\n\n===James West===\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = James West\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = {{Plain list |\n* Sally Brown (2018)<ref name=\"BABY\">{{cite news|author1=SOD|authorlink=Soap Opera Digest|title=GH BABY NEWS|url=https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gh-baby-news/|accessdate=June 14, 2018|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|agency=Odyssey Magazine Publishing Group Inc.|publisher=[[American Media, Inc.]]|date=May 23, 2018|location=United States}}</ref><ref name=\"GH C&GMay 2018\">{{cite web|author1=Soaps SheKnows|authorlink1=Soaps.com|title=General Hospital Comings & Goings|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/comings-and-goings|website=[[Soaps.com]]|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=June 13, 2018|location=United States|date=May 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Marciano twins (2018\u201319)<ref name=\"Twins\"/>\n* Kyler and Caleb Ends (2019\u2013)<ref name=\"Ends\"/>\n}}\n| first          = {{Start date|2018|05|21}}\n| last           = \n| years          = 2018\u2013\n| creator        = {{Plain list |\n* [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]]\n}}\n| introducer     = [[Frank Valentini]]  \n| classification = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| residence      = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family         = [[Scorpio/Jones family|Scorpio/Jones]]\n| father         = [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]]\n| mother         = [[Maxie Jones]]\n| halfsisters    = [[#Georgie Spinelli|Georgie Spinelli]]\n| grandfathers   = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Cesar Faison]]\n* [[Frisco Jones]]\n* [[Mac Scorpio]] (step)\n}}\n| grandmothers   = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Liesl Obrecht]]\n* [[Madeline Reeves]] (adoptive)\n* [[Felicia Jones]]\n}}\n| uncles         = [[Peter August]]\n| aunts          = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Britt Westbourne]]\n* [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Nina Reeves|Nina Reeves]] (adoptive)\n* [[Georgie Jones]]\n}}\n| relatives      =\n}}\n'''James Malcolm West''' is the son of [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]] and [[Maxie Jones]], born onscreen May 21, 2018.\n\n====Casting====\nSally Brown was cast as James Malcolm West.<ref name=\"BABY\"/><ref name=\"GH C&GMay 2018\"/> The Marciano twins replaced Sally Brown.<ref name=\"Twins\">{{cite tweet|user=Star_Kidz|author=Star Kidz|authorlink=|number=1045105215614197761|date=September 26, 2018|title=#GH casting news - The Marciano Twins are playing the role of James|link=https://twitter.com/Star_Kidz/status/1045105215614197761|accessdate=April 10, 2019}}</ref> On August 30, 2019, Kyler and Caleb Ends debuted as a recast.<ref name=\"Ends\">{{cite web|first=Candace|last=Young|title=''General Hospital'' casting Kyler and Caleb Ends as recast James West|url=https://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/comings-and-goings/550110/general-hospital-casting-caleb-kyler-ends-recast-james-west/|website=[[Soaps.com]]|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=September 26, 2019|location=United States|date=September 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Storylines====\nJames is delivered with the help of his uncle, [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Peter August|Peter August]].<ref name=GH052118>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Frank Valentini]] ([[Executive producer]]); [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); [[Larry Carpenter]] ([[Television director|Director]]); Scott Sickles ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= May 21, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14041|language= English}}</ref> Maxie's water breaks in Peter's car after leaving the Nurses' Ball.

J.\" Jones''' was born on October 6, 1986, the daughter of [[Tony Jones (General Hospital)|Tony Jones]] and his first wife, [[Tania Roskov]]. She was named Barbara Jean in honor of nurse [[Bobbie Spencer]], who helped with the delivery (Tania was alone in her apartment during a storm and power outage when she goes into labor). Bobbie adopts B. J. and marries Tony years later, after Tania dies in a car accident.\n\n====Storylines====\nSeven-year-old B. J. was left brain-dead after her school van was hit by a drunk driver in May 1994. Her father made the decision to donate B. J.'s organs, and her heart was transplanted into her ailing cousin [[Maxie Jones]]. In a moving scene, Tony laid his head on Maxie's chest and listened to his daughter's heartbeat within his niece. Later, Tony sat beside B. J.'s body (still on the operating table); he asked her to take his own broken heart in exchange, and keep it safe. The storyline won much critical acclaim and several awards for acting and writing.\n\nIn May 2005, Maxie has a heart attack at a party on the Haunted Star and has to undergo another heart transplant, but she doesn't want to have it because she wants to keep B. J.'s heart. Luckily, Maxie recovers and does not need the transplant.\n\nIn February 2009, as part of the ABC Daytime \"Go Red\" campaign for women with heart disease, the storyline was reprised. Maxie fell asleep after attending the \"Go Red\" fashion show in New York City; while asleep she dreamed of an alternate universe, where she died and B. J. lived. When she woke up, Maxie was glad to be alive. On October 6, 2011, Maxie celebrated B. J.'s birthday with a red heart balloon and a small stone saying \"Barbara Jean Jones: Will not be forgotten.\" B. J. was also shown in a picture.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Rafe Kovich, Jr.===\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Rafe Kovich, Jr.\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = Jimmy Deshler\n| years          = 2013\u201314\n| first          = January 30, 2013\n| last           = July 16, 2014\n| creator        = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer     = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| classification = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former, recurring]]\n| residence      = \n| parents        = [[Stephen Clay]] <br> [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Alison Barrington|Alison Barrington]] <br> [[Rafe Kovich and Alison Barrington|Rafe Kovich]] (legal)\n| adoptiveparents = [[Silas Clay]] {{small|(foster)}}<br />[[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]] {{small|(foster)}}<ref>Stated by Sam on June 3, 2014</ref>\n| stepmother     = Livvie Locke (2003)\n| grandparents   = Malcolm Barrington <br>Elizabeth Barrington\n| uncles         = [[Silas Clay]]\n| cousins        = [[Kiki Jerome]]<br>[[Nelle Benson]]\n| relatives      = [[Amanda Barrington]]\n}}\n'''Rafe Kovich, Jr.''' was the son of Stephen Clay and [[Alison Barrington]], and the legal son of [[Rafe Kovich]]. The character was created from the storyline of the defunct spin-off series ''[[Port Charles]]'', where the character was originally the son of [[Caleb Morley]] and Alison.\n\n====Storylines====\nRafe arrives in Port Charles with Alison, having spent most of his life on the run. He bonds with [[Molly Lansing]] when she buys him lunch. Soon after, he witnesses Alison being murdered by Caleb. [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]] finds Rafe next to his mother's body, and Rafe is arrested. Rafe insists he's innocent, and points the finger at John. Caleb shows up and frees Rafe, but Rafe manages to escape and hides out in Molly's house. He's discovered soon after, though, and goes back to jail. When Caleb kidnaps Molly's sister, [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], and nephew, [[#Danny Morgan|Danny]], John and Rafe break out of prison with [[Lucy Coe]] to rescue them. While John and Lucy rescue Sam, Rafe watches over Danny, protecting him from [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]]. After being released by the police, he is adopted by Sam. When Stephen's brother, [[Silas Clay|Silas]], shows up in town, he sues Sam for custody of Rafe, and wins. However, he lets Rafe stay with Sam. Eventually, the two bond, and Rafe moves in with his uncle. Rafe has developed a crush on Molly, but she is dating [[TJ Ashford]]. Rafe tries to break them apart with help from [[#Taylor DuBois|Taylor DuBois]], who has a crush on TJ. The plan fails, and Rafe intentionally tries to sabotage Molly and TJ. When Molly finds out, she cuts Rafe out of her life. Upset and depressed, Rafe starts spiraling downwards, using cocaine and stealing money from Sam to get drugs. Molly finds out about Rafe's drug use. By then, it's also revealed that Rafe caused an accident to run [[Patrick Drake]]'s family off the road, killing his [[#Gabriel Santiago|infant son]]. Rafe tries to skip town, but Molly catches up to him, and they drive off in Silas' car. Rafe tells Molly he caused the accident, but was not on drugs. He was ordered to run Patrick off the road. Before he can tell Molly who ordered him, the car crashes. Rafe is rushed to the hospital with a serious head injury. Despite surgery, Rafe is left brain-dead, and put on life support. His family said good-bye to him, then turned off the machines.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Oscar Nero===\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Oscar Nero\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = [[Rio Mangini]] (2017) <br>[[Garren Stitt]] (2017\u201319)\n| first          = June 23, 2017\n| last           = {{End date|2019|05|02|mf=yes}}{{efn|Stitt last appeared on May 2, 2019, however, made a previously announced appearance in a pre-taped messaged as Oscar for Josslyn on May 21, 2019.

Maxie tried to pass her off as the daughter of [[Dante Falconeri|Dante]] and [[Lulu Spencer|Lulu Falconeri]], whom she had agreed to be a surrogate for until she miscarried. Maxie gives birth via C-section; Dante and Lulu name the baby Constanza \"Connie\" Louise Falconeri, after Dante's late cousin, [[Kate Howard|Connie Falconeri]], and ask Maxie and Spinelli to be her godparents. At the christening, [[Brad Cooper (General Hospital)|Brad Cooper]] arrives and tells Dante and Lulu that Connie is Maxie and Spinelli's biological daughter. After a custody battle, Spinelli is awarded full custody of baby Connie, while Maxie is not allowed to have any contact with her daughter for six months. In mid-December, Spinelli and his girlfriend, [[Ellie Trout]] move with Connie to Portland. Despite the court order, Spinelli takes the baby to say goodbye to Maxie and they rename her Georgie, after Maxie's late sister and Spinelli's good friend, [[Georgie Jones]]. Maxie was eventually granted visitation by the judge, and spends the holidays with Georgie. Spinelli and Georgie temporarily moved back to Port Charles when Spinelli was hoping to get a second chance with Maxie. However, he later reconciled with Ellie, and took Georgie back to Portland with Ellie.

During this time, on Halloween 2003, she sleeps with [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Zander Smith|Zander Smith]] for the second time and ends up pregnant. Due to Zander's dangerous lifestyle, Elizabeth and Ric (who had since reconciled) decide to raise the child together without Zander involved. Zander agrees to let Elizabeth and Ric raise his child. Elizabeth ends up divorcing Ric when she realizes that he won't let go of his obsession with Sonny. Soon after, Zander dies in a police shootout (more specifically suicide by cop).

In July 2015, it was revealed that he was actually alive after being kidnapped by [[Helena Cassadine]]. He is rescued by Lucky, Luke, and [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura]], and returns home, where he is now raised by [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Drew Cain|Drew]] (believed to be Jason) and Elizabeth. When Drew and Elizabeth's engagement ends, Jake is upset, and tries to get Drew to come back home. Elizabeth's house starts getting vandalized, and Drew eventually realizes Jake was the one behind the vandalism in order to try to get his parents back together. Sam tries to help Jake when she figures this out, but Jake panics and runs away. Sam follows him, but she slips and falls down the stairs. Scared that he hurt Sam, Jake runs away on his bike and gets hit by a car. Jake survives, though, and is taken to a children's hospital, where he recovers from his injuries. Jake was unwittingly programmed by Helena. The programming came to fruition at the 2017 Nurses Ball. He received a magic kit from Helena's operatives thinking it was from Spencer. Inside was a dangerous chemical weapon created by the WSB known as the Chimera. He was allowed to do his magic routine after the Nurse's ball was over where he almost opened the chimera which would have exposed and killed all that attended. He was stopped by Drew, Elizabeth and [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] (who was the person who sold the Chimera to Helena).   \n{{clear}}\n\n===James West===\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = James West\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = {{Plain list |\n* Sally Brown (2018)<ref name=\"BABY\">{{cite news|author1=SOD|authorlink=Soap Opera Digest|title=GH BABY NEWS|url=https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gh-baby-news/|accessdate=June 14, 2018|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|agency=Odyssey Magazine Publishing Group Inc.|publisher=[[American Media, Inc.]]|date=May 23, 2018|location=United States}}</ref><ref name=\"GH C&GMay 2018\">{{cite web|author1=Soaps SheKnows|authorlink1=Soaps.com|title=General Hospital Comings & Goings|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/comings-and-goings|website=[[Soaps.com]]|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=June 13, 2018|location=United States|date=May 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Marciano twins (2018\u201319)<ref name=\"Twins\"/>\n* Kyler and Caleb Ends (2019\u2013)<ref name=\"Ends\"/>\n}}\n| first          = {{Start date|2018|05|21}}\n| last           = \n| years          = 2018\u2013\n| creator        = {{Plain list |\n* [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]]\n}}\n| introducer     = [[Frank Valentini]]  \n| classification = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| residence      = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family         = [[Scorpio/Jones family|Scorpio/Jones]]\n| father         = [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]]\n| mother         = [[Maxie Jones]]\n| halfsisters    = [[#Georgie Spinelli|Georgie Spinelli]]\n| grandfathers   = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Cesar Faison]]\n* [[Frisco Jones]]\n* [[Mac Scorpio]] (step)\n}}\n| grandmothers   = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Liesl Obrecht]]\n* [[Madeline Reeves]] (adoptive)\n* [[Felicia Jones]]\n}}\n| uncles         = [[Peter August]]\n| aunts          = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Britt Westbourne]]\n* [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Nina Reeves|Nina Reeves]] (adoptive)\n* [[Georgie Jones]]\n}}\n| relatives      =\n}}\n'''James Malcolm West''' is the son of [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]] and [[Maxie Jones]], born onscreen May 21, 2018.\n\n====Casting====\nSally Brown was cast as James Malcolm West.<ref name=\"BABY\"/><ref name=\"GH C&GMay 2018\"/> The Marciano twins replaced Sally Brown.<ref name=\"Twins\">{{cite tweet|user=Star_Kidz|author=Star Kidz|authorlink=|number=1045105215614197761|date=September 26, 2018|title=#GH casting news - The Marciano Twins are playing the role of James|link=https://twitter.com/Star_Kidz/status/1045105215614197761|accessdate=April 10, 2019}}</ref> On August 30, 2019, Kyler and Caleb Ends debuted as a recast.<ref name=\"Ends\">{{cite web|first=Candace|last=Young|title=''General Hospital'' casting Kyler and Caleb Ends as recast James West|url=https://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/comings-and-goings/550110/general-hospital-casting-caleb-kyler-ends-recast-james-west/|website=[[Soaps.com]]|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=September 26, 2019|location=United States|date=September 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Storylines====\nJames is delivered with the help of his uncle, [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Peter August|Peter August]].<ref name=GH052118>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Frank Valentini]] ([[Executive producer]]); [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); [[Larry Carpenter]] ([[Television director|Director]]); Scott Sickles ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= May 21, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14041|language= English}}</ref> Maxie's water breaks in Peter's car after leaving the Nurses' Ball.

J.'s heart. Luckily, Maxie recovers and does not need the transplant.\n\nIn February 2009, as part of the ABC Daytime \"Go Red\" campaign for women with heart disease, the storyline was reprised. Maxie fell asleep after attending the \"Go Red\" fashion show in New York City; while asleep she dreamed of an alternate universe, where she died and B. J. lived. When she woke up, Maxie was glad to be alive. On October 6, 2011, Maxie celebrated B. J.'s birthday with a red heart balloon and a small stone saying \"Barbara Jean Jones: Will not be forgotten.\" B.

He bonds with [[Molly Lansing]] when she buys him lunch. Soon after, he witnesses Alison being murdered by Caleb. [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]] finds Rafe next to his mother's body, and Rafe is arrested. Rafe insists he's innocent, and points the finger at John. Caleb shows up and frees Rafe, but Rafe manages to escape and hides out in Molly's house. He's discovered soon after, though, and goes back to jail. When Caleb kidnaps Molly's sister, [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], and nephew, [[#Danny Morgan|Danny]], John and Rafe break out of prison with [[Lucy Coe]] to rescue them. While John and Lucy rescue Sam, Rafe watches over Danny, protecting him from [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]]. After being released by the police, he is adopted by Sam. When Stephen's brother, [[Silas Clay|Silas]], shows up in town, he sues Sam for custody of Rafe, and wins. However, he lets Rafe stay with Sam. Eventually, the two bond, and Rafe moves in with his uncle. Rafe has developed a crush on Molly, but she is dating [[TJ Ashford]]. Rafe tries to break them apart with help from [[#Taylor DuBois|Taylor DuBois]], who has a crush on TJ. The plan fails, and Rafe intentionally tries to sabotage Molly and TJ. When Molly finds out, she cuts Rafe out of her life. Upset and depressed, Rafe starts spiraling downwards, using cocaine and stealing money from Sam to get drugs. Molly finds out about Rafe's drug use. By then, it's also revealed that Rafe caused an accident to run [[Patrick Drake]]'s family off the road, killing his [[#Gabriel Santiago|infant son]]. Rafe tries to skip town, but Molly catches up to him, and they drive off in Silas' car. Rafe tells Molly he caused the accident, but was not on drugs. He was ordered to run Patrick off the road. Before he can tell Molly who ordered him, the car crashes. Rafe is rushed to the hospital with a serious head injury. Despite surgery, Rafe is left brain-dead, and put on life support.

Poddar had made it known to his psychologist, during a session, that he wanted to kill Tarasoff, and his psychologist informed the campus police, following the session, of the danger that Poddar posed to himself and others and suggested that hospitalization might be necessary. The psychologist also wrote a letter requesting assistance to the chief of campus police. Upon investigation by the police, during which Poddar was briefly detained for questioning, he was released because his mental state seemed to be stable and rational. Shortly thereafter, the director of the department of psychiatry at Cowell Hospital asked for the police to return the letter and ordered that Poddar's therapy notes should be destroyed. No one ever warned Tatiana Tarasoff. Poddar killed Tatiana Tarasoff on October 27, 1969, and her parents filed suit against several of the organizations and individuals who had been involved. The case was initially dismissed by a lower court, but her parents appealed to the California Supreme Court, which upheld the appeal in 1974 and reaffirmed the ruling in 1976. The case was settled out of court when Tarasoff's parents received a substantial sum of money.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nExplicit in the court's decision was the principle that the confidentiality of the therapeutic relationship is subordinate to the safety of society and its members.<ref name=\"Ever\" /> Despite the value and importance of protecting the client and their feelings, and thus the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|physician-client relationship]], the court decided that the clinician's [[duty]] to society as a citizen of that society places certain limitations on the clinician's loyalty to a client's secrets, divulged in the context of the therapeutic relationship.\n\nSome have decried the court's decision as a limitation of the foundation for the therapeutic relationship and progress, the client's expectation of confidentiality. [[Max Siegel (psychologist)|Max Siegel]], a former president of the American Psychological Association, defended the therapist's right to confidentiality as sacrosanct, under any circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=M |date=April 1979 |title=Privacy, ethics, and confidentiality |journal=[[Professional Psychology]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=249\u2013258 |pmid=11661846 }}</ref> Furthermore, he suggested that had Poddar's psychologist maintained confidentiality, instead of alerting the police, Poddar might have remained in counseling and Tarasoff's death might have been averted through Poddar's psychological treatment.  Limitations to confidentiality are a critical concern for clinicians, because a relationship of trust between the therapist and client is the prerequisite context for therapeutic growth.<ref name=\"Ever\" /> Without the client's expectation that the therapist will honor the client's confidences divulged in the therapeutic dialogue, the client will not have the freedom to unveil the most troublesome and private issues that are matters of the utmost concern and need for intervention. Some argue that if clients cannot depend on confidentiality in all matters that are related in therapy, potentially dangerous clients, who may be most in need of psychological services, will avoid therapy, thus missing the opportunity for intervention.<ref name=\"Trib\" /> If a trend of restrictions on confidentiality develops in legislation, some{{Who|date=June 2016}} argue that the ability of therapists and counselors to effectively practice and facilitate clients' growth may be significantly impaired.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOther cases similar to the issues addressed in the Tarasoff case have been brought to the attention of the courts, such as the ''[[Jablonski by Pahls v. United States]]''. The conclusion of that case extended the responsibility entailed in the duty to warn with the judgment that the clinician may be liable for failure to review previous records, which may contain history of previous violent behavior, a predictor of potential future violence.\n\nRecent consideration of applying the duty to warn has raised questions regarding therapists' responsibility to breach confidentiality in order to report clients' nonviolent behaviors which may pose danger to others, as in the case of clients with [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=\"Trib\" /> Clients with HIV/AIDS who are sexually promiscuous or share needles may pose risks to their companions, who may be unaware of the client's health condition. Although the possibility of infection that may result is a factor of concern, the duty to warn currently does not prescribe breaking confidentiality in these cases.  In such cases, there may be uncertainty regarding potential victims and, perhaps, ignorance about the occurrence of behaviors that would pose the danger of transmission. Furthermore, many states prohibit the disclosure of information about HIV/AIDS.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe application of duty-to-warn laws places clinicians in the uneasy situation of breaching the client's confidentiality or of placing others in potential danger of the client. In either case, the therapist's decision may make place himself at risk, professionally and legally, especially since the clinician has no certain method for determining a client's potential for violent behavior. The application of the principle may be difficult in particular situations; however, if the clinician has reasonable cause to think that danger is imminent, the clinician is required to break confidentiality for the safety of others.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Criminal activity==\n\n===Website users===\nIn ''[[Jane Doe No. 14 v.

Poddar had made it known to his psychologist, during a session, that he wanted to kill Tarasoff, and his psychologist informed the campus police, following the session, of the danger that Poddar posed to himself and others and suggested that hospitalization might be necessary. The psychologist also wrote a letter requesting assistance to the chief of campus police. Upon investigation by the police, during which Poddar was briefly detained for questioning, he was released because his mental state seemed to be stable and rational. Shortly thereafter, the director of the department of psychiatry at Cowell Hospital asked for the police to return the letter and ordered that Poddar's therapy notes should be destroyed. No one ever warned Tatiana Tarasoff. Poddar killed Tatiana Tarasoff on October 27, 1969, and her parents filed suit against several of the organizations and individuals who had been involved. The case was initially dismissed by a lower court, but her parents appealed to the California Supreme Court, which upheld the appeal in 1974 and reaffirmed the ruling in 1976. The case was settled out of court when Tarasoff's parents received a substantial sum of money.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nExplicit in the court's decision was the principle that the confidentiality of the therapeutic relationship is subordinate to the safety of society and its members.<ref name=\"Ever\" /> Despite the value and importance of protecting the client and their feelings, and thus the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|physician-client relationship]], the court decided that the clinician's [[duty]] to society as a citizen of that society places certain limitations on the clinician's loyalty to a client's secrets, divulged in the context of the therapeutic relationship.\n\nSome have decried the court's decision as a limitation of the foundation for the therapeutic relationship and progress, the client's expectation of confidentiality. [[Max Siegel (psychologist)|Max Siegel]], a former president of the American Psychological Association, defended the therapist's right to confidentiality as sacrosanct, under any circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=M |date=April 1979 |title=Privacy, ethics, and confidentiality |journal=[[Professional Psychology]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=249\u2013258 |pmid=11661846 }}</ref> Furthermore, he suggested that had Poddar's psychologist maintained confidentiality, instead of alerting the police, Poddar might have remained in counseling and Tarasoff's death might have been averted through Poddar's psychological treatment.  Limitations to confidentiality are a critical concern for clinicians, because a relationship of trust between the therapist and client is the prerequisite context for therapeutic growth.<ref name=\"Ever\" /> Without the client's expectation that the therapist will honor the client's confidences divulged in the therapeutic dialogue, the client will not have the freedom to unveil the most troublesome and private issues that are matters of the utmost concern and need for intervention. Some argue that if clients cannot depend on confidentiality in all matters that are related in therapy, potentially dangerous clients, who may be most in need of psychological services, will avoid therapy, thus missing the opportunity for intervention.<ref name=\"Trib\" /> If a trend of restrictions on confidentiality develops in legislation, some{{Who|date=June 2016}} argue that the ability of therapists and counselors to effectively practice and facilitate clients' growth may be significantly impaired.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOther cases similar to the issues addressed in the Tarasoff case have been brought to the attention of the courts, such as the ''[[Jablonski by Pahls v. United States]]''. The conclusion of that case extended the responsibility entailed in the duty to warn with the judgment that the clinician may be liable for failure to review previous records, which may contain history of previous violent behavior, a predictor of potential future violence.\n\nRecent consideration of applying the duty to warn has raised questions regarding therapists' responsibility to breach confidentiality in order to report clients' nonviolent behaviors which may pose danger to others, as in the case of clients with [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=\"Trib\" /> Clients with HIV/AIDS who are sexually promiscuous or share needles may pose risks to their companions, who may be unaware of the client's health condition. Although the possibility of infection that may result is a factor of concern, the duty to warn currently does not prescribe breaking confidentiality in these cases.  In such cases, there may be uncertainty regarding potential victims and, perhaps, ignorance about the occurrence of behaviors that would pose the danger of transmission. Furthermore, many states prohibit the disclosure of information about HIV/AIDS.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe application of duty-to-warn laws places clinicians in the uneasy situation of breaching the client's confidentiality or of placing others in potential danger of the client. In either case, the therapist's decision may make place himself at risk, professionally and legally, especially since the clinician has no certain method for determining a client's potential for violent behavior. The application of the principle may be difficult in particular situations; however, if the clinician has reasonable cause to think that danger is imminent, the clinician is required to break confidentiality for the safety of others.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Criminal activity==\n\n===Website users===\nIn ''[[Jane Doe No. 14 v.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country.

This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve.

The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the east gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester.

[[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around South and North Gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of North Gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite East Gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.
