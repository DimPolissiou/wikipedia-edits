After brother Louis emigrated to the United States and earned enough money, he sent for Gaston and Arthur to join him. Once there, Gaston worked as an automotive mechanic and joined his brothers in auto racing.\n\nIn 1916, the year after older brother Louis left the Chevrolet car company, Gaston Chevrolet became a partner with Louis and Arthur in the new [[Frontenac Motor Corporation]].\n\n==Indianapolis 500==\nDriving a Frontenac race car, Chevrolet competed in the 1919 [[Indianapolis 500]], finishing in tenth place while brother Louis finished seventh.\n\nChevrolet broke the dominance of [[Europe]]an built cars in the [[1920 Indianapolis 500]], winning the race in a redesigned Monroe-Frontenac. In the process, he became the first driver in the history of the {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} race to go the distance without making a tire change. Gaston was unable to defend his win because of his death later that year. Chevrolet was the last Frenchman to win the Indianapolis 500 until [[Simon Pagenaud]] won the [[2019 Indianapolis 500]], 99 years after the 1920 race.\n\n==1920 National Championship and death==\nFollowing his May 31, 1920 victory at Indianapolis, Chevrolet raced in several more events.
