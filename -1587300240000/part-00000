They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L. Chenery]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Collier's\">''A Cavalcade of Collier's'', edited by McArdle (''Collier's'' last editor), 1959 pp. xii-xiii.</ref><ref>''Magazines in the Twentieth Century'', Peterson, 1956 p. 188; ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1974 p. 38.</ref> Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-[[Roaring Twenties]], including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923\u201327). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L. Chenery]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Collier's\">''A Cavalcade of Collier's'', edited by McArdle (''Collier's'' last editor), 1959 pp. xii-xiii.</ref><ref>''Magazines in the Twentieth Century'', Peterson, 1956 p. 188; ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1974 p. 38.</ref> Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-[[Roaring Twenties]], including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923\u201327). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

One evening, he receives an email from the fictional St. Juliana Hospital, a local institution, offering him a temporary job opportunity. He contently accepts, scheduling to meet with the president the following day.\n\nThat afternoon, [[semi-formal]] and with a portfolio, Ryuji commutes to the hospital. After an acquaintance with Ren Nanase, a nurse who escorts him to the president, he is frightened to discover his potential employer is a woman he had brutally raped in the past, Narumi Jinguji. In spite of the excruciating atmosphere, however, Narumi explains her wish to develop a department in the hospital that caters to the sexual interests of patients; in need of his expertise to oversee the operation. Overwhelmed with lewd excitement, Ryuji agrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/night_shift_nurses/index.htm|title=Anime Profile: Night Shift Nurses|publisher=absoluteanime.com|author=Ken Innes IV|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref>\n\n'''Yakin By\u014dto 2''':\nA young elite doctor Souichiro Kuwabara couldn't forget his feelings towards Ren Nanase, whom he had fallen in love with back in his training days. He's been switching occupations at different hospitals one after another, to go look for her, and finally he meets her again at the Sei-Katorea General Hospital. However, her attitude was remote and sadly enough his love couldn't be fulfilled. To make things worse and more complicated, he finds a stack of photographs depicting Ren being molested. Ren had been turned into a lewd woman by Hirasaka when she was still working at St. Julianna. He was very disappointed after what he had witnessed to the point where he ends up losing his mind and going insane-(both mentally and sexually).\n\n'''Yakin By\u014dto 3''':\nYotsuya Jiro, an aspiring novelist was lying in front of a hospital. He was seriously injured, and when he though he was about to die, a pink haired nurse named Yuu Yagami, helped him. He was sent into an emergency ward, and he met a beautiful woman, Reika Mikage. She is a director of the hospital, and she asked him to become a test subject. Because he didn't have any relatives, he accepted it. Then, Yuu was supposed to take care of him. Since that day, his fate had changed a lot.\n\n'''Yakin By\u014dto Zero''':\nThis is the back story of how the genius doctor Ryuuji Hirasaka acquired his perverted pastime as a med school student. He and Narumi Jinguuji are rivals at the top of their class. One day, Narumi tells him that if he can seduce the woman she designates in the 2 weeks before graduation, she'll admit her defeat and do anything he tells her. The girls she suggests are just as beautiful and desirable as herself. Sensing his perverted perceptions transforming into a talent at her tantalizing suggestion, he readily agrees.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ryuji Hirasaka|\u6bd4\u826f\u5742 \u7adc\u4e8c|Hirasaka Ry\u016bji}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Sabro Gohno]]|[[Bjorkin Stiles]], [[Michael Sanderson]]}}\n:Ryuji Hirasaka is the aforementioned [[antihero]] of the series. A knowledgeable practitioner, his life takes a sharp turn when he is invited to direct and corrupt a team of nurses at his new place of work. An unconvicted sex offender, Ryuji is vicious, controlling and intimidating, often [[cold reading]] those under him to learn about their vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. He sports a mullet and is bespectacled. He is murdered by Ren at the end of episode 5. In ''Night Shift Nurses Kranke'' he has a better ending: he marries Ren and the couple decide to move to the countryside to continue their experiments.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narumi Jinguji|\u795e\u5bae\u5bfa \u6210\u7f8e|Jinguji Narumi}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Kaoru Hoshioki]]|Irie, [[Marcia Belle]], Likki Dee Split}}\n:Narumi Jinguji is the thirty-two-year-old<ref name=charbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.mink.co.jp/product/other/yakin1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb|publisher=mink.co.jp|accessdate=2010-11-20|language=Japanese}}</ref> head practitioner of the St. Juliana Hospital, specializing in gynaecology. Voluptuous and enticing, she arranges to meet with Ryuji one afternoon to offer him the chance to sexually discipline a select group of her nursing staff for the purpose of developing a prostitution ring. As a previous rape victim of her own employee, Narumi exhibits bursts of psychological imbalance and unrest. She is noted for her long green hair. Like Ryuji, she too wears glasses. She commits suicide after attempting to kill Ryuji near the end of episode 5. In ''Night Shift Nurses Kranke'', she is shown attending Ryuji and Ren's wedding.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ren Nanase|\u4e03\u702c \u604b|Nanase Ren}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Yuu Mikage]]|[[Lynna Dunham]], [[Kendall Harrison]]}}\n:Bright and friendly, Ren Nanase is a twenty-two-year-old<ref name=\"charbio\"/> nurse at the St. Juliana Hospital who is arguably the most iconic character of the series. She is the first nurse Ryuji meets and the first who genuinely welcomes him as a friend and superior. When her love for an inpatient boxer, Naoya Ohkawa, is discovered, Ryuji learns of her match fixing and uses it as blackmail. Like the nurses to come, in spite of the abhorrent treatment she receives, Ren develops Stockholm syndrome and becomes emotionally attached to her abuser. Ren is distinguishable by her incredibly long hair, of which is usually tied into a ponytail. It is later revealed that she is pregnant. She is the one who kills Ryuji after he gained back his consciousness. After being arrested she admits that she loves him. In Night Shift Nurses Kranke, she marries Ryuji, lives with him in the countryside, and becomes a \"good\" wife.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Remi Shinjyo|\u65b0\u57ce \u793c\u7f8e|Shinj\u014d Remi}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Nana Aikawa]]|Nursey, Lotus, [[Jessica Thorne]]}}\n:Remi Shinjyo is a twenty-seven-year-old<ref name=\"charbio\"/> senior nurse of the hospital maternity ward. As a headstrong superior, Remi is outwardly proud, fastidious and authoritative, especially to Ryuji. Although it is not mentioned until later, Remi is responsible for an act of [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]] that resulted in the death of a patient. Ryuji takes advantage of Remi's malpractice and subjects her to inhumane experiments. Like Ren, Remi falls for Ryuji and shows huge interest of wanting to be experimented by Ryuji again. Amongst all the nurses, she is one of the few nurses in the series that is not a virgin.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ako Fujisawa|\u85e4\u6ca2 \u4e9c\u5b50|Fujisawa Ako}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Saya Tohno]]|[[Alexis J.

The daughter of a wealthy family, she is falsely accused of stealing drugs from her department and this is used as the basis for her series of abuse.

As her department suggests, Hikaru absolutely loves children and like them, is energetic. She is the fourth and final nurse to be subjected to Ryuji and by far endures the most inhumane practices in the first phase of the series. It is later revealed that most of the group has to endure the same thing as her. Hikaru is noted for her pigtails and [[loose sock]]s. She has an adoptive sister, Ai, hospitalized for heart problems. She later admits to have fallen for the doctor. In ''Night Shift Nurses Kranke'', the doctor later does his experiments on both her and her sister.

One evening, he receives an email from the fictional St. Juliana Hospital, a local institution, offering him a temporary job opportunity. He contently accepts, scheduling to meet with the president the following day.\n\nThat afternoon, [[semi-formal]] and with a portfolio, Ryuji commutes to the hospital. After an acquaintance with Ren Nanase, a nurse who escorts him to the president, he is frightened to discover his potential employer is a woman he had brutally raped in the past, Narumi Jinguji. In spite of the excruciating atmosphere, however, Narumi explains her wish to develop a department in the hospital that caters to the sexual interests of patients; in need of his expertise to oversee the operation. Overwhelmed with lewd excitement, Ryuji agrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/night_shift_nurses/index.htm|title=Anime Profile: Night Shift Nurses|publisher=absoluteanime.com|author=Ken Innes IV|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref>\n\n'''Yakin By\u014dto 2''':\nA young elite doctor Souichiro Kuwabara couldn't forget his feelings towards Ren Nanase, whom he had fallen in love with back in his training days. He's been switching occupations at different hospitals one after another, to go look for her, and finally he meets her again at the Sei-Katorea General Hospital. However, her attitude was remote and sadly enough his love couldn't be fulfilled. To make things worse and more complicated, he finds a stack of photographs depicting Ren being molested. Ren had been turned into a lewd woman by Hirasaka when she was still working at St. Julianna. He was very disappointed after what he had witnessed to the point where he ends up losing his mind and going insane-(both mentally and sexually).\n\n'''Yakin By\u014dto 3''':\nYotsuya Jiro, an aspiring novelist was lying in front of a hospital. He was seriously injured, and when he though he was about to die, a pink haired nurse named Yuu Yagami, helped him. He was sent into an emergency ward, and he met a beautiful woman, Reika Mikage. She is a director of the hospital, and she asked him to become a test subject. Because he didn't have any relatives, he accepted it. Then, Yuu was supposed to take care of him. Since that day, his fate had changed a lot.\n\n'''Yakin By\u014dto Zero''':\nThis is the back story of how the genius doctor Ryuuji Hirasaka acquired his perverted pastime as a med school student. He and Narumi Jinguuji are rivals at the top of their class. One day, Narumi tells him that if he can seduce the woman she designates in the 2 weeks before graduation, she'll admit her defeat and do anything he tells her. The girls she suggests are just as beautiful and desirable as herself. Sensing his perverted perceptions transforming into a talent at her tantalizing suggestion, he readily agrees.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ryuji Hirasaka|\u6bd4\u826f\u5742 \u7adc\u4e8c|Hirasaka Ry\u016bji}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Sabro Gohno]]|[[Bjorkin Stiles]], [[Michael Sanderson]]}}\n:Ryuji Hirasaka is the aforementioned [[antihero]] of the series. A knowledgeable practitioner, his life takes a sharp turn when he is invited to direct and corrupt a team of nurses at his new place of work. An unconvicted sex offender, Ryuji is vicious, controlling and intimidating, often [[cold reading]] those under him to learn about their vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. He sports a mullet and is bespectacled. He is murdered by Ren at the end of episode 5. In ''Night Shift Nurses Kranke'' he has a better ending: he gets married to Ren and the couple decide to move to the countryside to continue their experiments.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narumi Jinguji|\u795e\u5bae\u5bfa \u6210\u7f8e|Jinguji Narumi}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Kaoru Hoshioki]]|Irie, [[Marcia Belle]], Likki Dee Split}}\n:Narumi Jinguji is the thirty-two-year-old<ref name=charbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.mink.co.jp/product/other/yakin1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb|publisher=mink.co.jp|accessdate=2010-11-20|language=Japanese}}</ref> head practitioner of the St. Juliana Hospital, specializing in gynaecology. Voluptuous and enticing, she arranges to meet with Ryuji one afternoon to offer him the chance to sexually discipline a select group of her nursing staff for the purpose of developing a prostitution ring. As a previous rape victim of her own employee, Narumi exhibits bursts of psychological imbalance and unrest. She is noted for her long green hair. Like Ryuji, she too wears glasses. She commits suicide after attempting to kill Ryuji near the end of episode 5. In ''Night Shift Nurses Kranke'', she is shown attending Ryuji and Ren's wedding.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ren Nanase|\u4e03\u702c \u604b|Nanase Ren}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Yuu Mikage]]|[[Lynna Dunham]], [[Kendall Harrison]]}}\n:Bright and friendly, Ren Nanase is a twenty-two-year-old<ref name=\"charbio\"/> nurse at the St. Juliana Hospital who is arguably the most iconic character of the series. She is the first nurse Ryuji meets and the first who genuinely welcomes him as a friend and superior. When her love for an inpatient boxer, Naoya Ohkawa, is discovered, Ryuji learns of her match fixing and uses it as blackmail. Like the nurses to come, in spite of the abhorrent treatment she receives, Ren develops Stockholm syndrome and becomes emotionally attached to her abuser. Ren is distinguishable by her incredibly long hair, of which is usually tied into a ponytail. It is later revealed that she is pregnant. She is the one who kills Ryuji after he gained back his consciousness. After being arrested she admits that she loves him. In Night Shift Nurses Kranke, she gets married to Ryuji, lives with him in the countryside, and becomes a \"good\" wife.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Remi Shinjyo|\u65b0\u57ce \u793c\u7f8e|Shinj\u014d Remi}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Nana Aikawa]]|Nursey, Lotus, [[Jessica Thorne]]}}\n:Remi Shinjyo is a twenty-seven-year-old<ref name=\"charbio\"/> senior nurse of the hospital maternity ward. As a headstrong superior, Remi is outwardly proud, fastidious and authoritative, especially to Ryuji. Although it is not mentioned until later, Remi is responsible for an act of [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]] that resulted in the death of a patient. Ryuji takes advantage of Remi's malpractice and subjects her to inhumane experiments. Like Ren, Remi falls for Ryuji and shows huge interest of wanting to be experimented by Ryuji again. Amongst all the nurses, she is one of the few nurses in the series that is not a virgin.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ako Fujisawa|\u85e4\u6ca2 \u4e9c\u5b50|Fujisawa Ako}}\n<!--DO NOT WIKILINK THE NAMES OF THE VOICE ACTORS/-TRESSES UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->:{{Voiced by|[[Saya Tohno]]|[[Alexis J.

As her department suggests, Hikaru absolutely loves children and like them, is energetic. She is the fourth and final nurse to be subjected to Ryuji and by far endures the most inhumane practices in the first phase of the series. It is later revealed that most of the group has to endure the same thing as her. Hikaru is noted for her pigtails and [[loose sock]]s. She has an adoptive sister, Ai, hospitalized for heart problems. She later admits to have fallen for the doctor. In ''Night Shift Nurses Kranke'', the doctor later does his experiments on both her and her sister. During Ryuji and Ren's wedding, she is the one who catches the bouquet.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ai Kodama|\u5150\u7389 \u3042\u3044|Kodama Ai}}\n:Ai Kodama is Hikaru's [[Adoption|adopted]] younger sister and a female patient at St. Juliana Hospital who suffers from a serious heart condition.
