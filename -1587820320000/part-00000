It is the fourth major installment of the ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' series and seventh overall, and a sequel to the [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|2015 reboot of the series]]. It was developed by [[EA DICE]], in collaboration with [[Criterion Games]] and [[Motive Studios]], and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was released worldwide on November 17, 2017 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nUpon release, ''Battlefront II'' received mixed reviews from critics. The game was also subject to [[List of video games notable for negative reception|widespread criticism]] regarding the status of its [[loot box]]es, which could give players [[Pay to win|substantial gameplay advantages]] if purchased with real money. A response from EA's community team on [[Reddit]] on the topic became the single most down-voted comment in the site's history<ref name=\"Salinis\">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/13/ea-star-wars-game-is-so-unpopular-the-developer-is-getting-threats.html | title = EA's new Star Wars game is so unpopular a developer is apparently getting death threats | first = Sara | last = Salinis | date = November 13, 2017 | accessdate = November 13, 2017 | publisher = [[CNBC]] }}</ref> \u2013 and in response, EA decided to temporarily remove [[microtransaction]]s from the game until a later date.

The game offers a variety of unique game modes, most of which have the player take control of four main ground classes (Assault, Heavy, Officer and Specialist), aligned to either the [[Galactic Republic]] (represented by [[clone trooper]]s), the Separatists ([[battle droids]]), the Rebel Alliance (Rebel troopers), the Empire ([[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]]), the Resistance (Resistance troopers), or the First Order (First Order stormtroopers), and compete in large or small scale battles against other players (or, in some cases, enemies controlled by an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]).\n\nIn space battles, the players take control of space ships rather than ground troopers or vehicles, but the play style is more or less the same, also being class-based. The are a total of three base classes for the space battles:\n\n*'''Fighter''' - represented by the [[ARC-170]] Starfighter and, on Naboo only, the [[Naboo starfighter|N-1]] Starfighter for the Republic; the [[Vulture droid|Vulture Droid]] for the Separatists; the [[X-wing fighter|T-65B X-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE fighter|TIE/ln Fighter]] for the Empire; the T-70 X-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/fo Fighter for the First Order.\n*'''Interceptor''' - the [[V-Wing Starfighter|V-Wing]] for the Republic; the [[Droid tri-fighter|Droid Tri-Fighter]] for the Separatists; the [[A-wing|RZ-1 A-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE interceptor|TIE/IN Interceptor]] for the Empire; the RZ-2 A-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/sf Fighter for the First Order\n*'''Bomber''' - the [[Y-wing|BTL-B Y-Wing]] for the Republic; the ''Hyena''-class bomber for the Separatists; the BTL-A4 Y-Wing for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[TIE Bomber|TIE/sa Bomber]] for the Empire\n\nThere are also six additional \"reinforcement\" classes, that are unlocked during every match by acquiring battlepoints (earned from defeating enemies or completing specific objectives during each match). For the ground troopers, there are three reinforcement classes:\n\n*'''Enforcer''' - the [[Wookiee]] Warrior and [[Clone commando|Clone Commando]] for the Republic; the [[Super Battle Droid|B2 Super Battle Droid]] and the [[Droideka (Star Wars)|Droideka]] for the Separatists; the Wookie Warrior for the Rebel Allaince; the [[Deathtrooper|Death Trooper]] for the Empire; the Ovissian Gunner for the Resistance; and the First Order Flametrooper.\n*'''Aerial''' - the Jet Trooper for the Republic; B2-RP Rocket Droid for the Separatists; the Rebel Rocket-Jumper; the Imperial Rocket Trooper; the Resistance Rocket-Jumper; and the First Order Jet Trooper.\n*'''Infiltrator''' - the [[Advanced Recon Commando]] / ARC Trooper for the Republic; the Commando Droid for the Separatists; the [[Ewok]] Hunter for the Rebel Alliance; the ISB Agent for the Empire; the Caphex Spy for the Resistance; and the Sith Trooper for the First Order.\n\nThe other three reinforcements are vehicles:\n\n*'''Speeder''' - the [[BARC Speeder]] for the Republic; the [[Speeder bike|STAP]] for the Separatists; the T-47 Airspeeder / [[Snowspeeder]], X-34 [[Landspeeder]] and 74-Z [[Speeder bike|Speeder Bike]] for the Rebel Alliance; the 74-Z Speeder Bike for the Empire; a stolen LIUV / First Order Snowspeeder and the V-4X-D Ski Speeder for the Resistance; and the LIUV for the First Order.\n*'''Artillery''' - the [[LAAT]] Gunship and the [[AT-TE]] for the Republic; the [[MTT (Star Wars)|MTT]] for the Separatists; the [[U-wing|U-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[At at|AT-AT]] for the Empire.\n*'''Armor''' - the [[AT-RT]] and the [[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank|TX-130]] for the Republic; the [[Armored Assault Tank|AAT]] for the Separatists; the AT-RT for the Rebel Alliance; the [[AT-ST]] for the Empire; a stolen First Order AT-ST for the Resistance; and the First Order AT-ST.\n\n=== Heroes ===\n''Battlefront II'' allows the players to take control of several heroes and villains based on iconic characters from across all the ''Star Wars'' movies. At launch, the hero roster included [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]), [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), [[Chewbacca]], [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), [[Yoda]] ([[Tom Kane]]), and [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]), while the villain roster included [[Darth Vader]] ([[Matt Sloan (voice actor)|Matt Sloan]]), [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Sam Witwer]]), [[Boba Fett]] ([[Temuera Morrison]]), [[Bossk (Star Wars)|Bossk]] ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]), [[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]), [[Darth Maul]] (Sam Witwer), and [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]/[[Roger Craig Smith]]).\n\nThere are also several hero and villain ships, which at launch included Boba Fett's ''[[Slave I]]'', Darth Maul's ''[[Sith Infiltrator|Scimitar]]'', Darth Vader's [[TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced x1]], Han Solo and Chewbacca's ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Iden Versio's [[TIE fighter|TIE/in Fighter]], Kylo Ren's TIE Silencer, Luke Skywalker's T-65B [[X-wing fighter|X-Wing]], [[Poe Dameron]]'s T-70 X-Wing, Rey and Chewbacca's ''Millennium Falcon'', and Yoda's [[Jedi interceptor|Actis-class Light Interceptor]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kae-JjbLsgA|title=Star Wars Battlefront II: Full Length Reveal Trailer|date=April 15, 2017|last=EA Star Wars|accessdate=April 16, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNew heroes and hero ships from across all eras were added later on, including [[Tallie Lintra]]'s RZ-2 A-Wing, Lando Calrissian and [[L3-37]]'s ''Millennium Falcon'' (from ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''), [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[James Arnold Taylor]]), Anakin Skywalker ([[Matt Lanter]]), [[General Grievous]] (Matthew Wood), [[Count Dooku]] ([[Corey Burton]]), [[BB-8]] and [[BB-9E]].\n\n=== Progression System ===\nThe game features a progression system based on \"Star Cards\", which are unlocked as the player levels up with a specific class or hero and grant them specific benefits. Players level up by defeating enemies or completing objectives during each match. Each class or hero can have a maximum of three Star Cards equipped, and each Star Card can be leveled up to level 4, each level further increasing its benefits. There are also milestones, which grant the player rewards for completing specific tasks, or for simply leveling up with a class or a hero.\n\nFor the four base trooper classes, there are up to four unlockable weapons, which are unlocked by completing specific milestones and each have their particular advantages, such as improved range, damage or fire rate. Each weapon also comes with modifications, which improve specific stats and are also unlocked by completing milestones.\n\n=== Multiplayer modes ===\nThere are a total of twelve online multiplayer game modes, some of which are available to play only for a limited time, with the largest supporting up to 40 simultaneous players with 24 additional AI-controlled players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/26/star-wars-battlefront-2-multiplayer-maps-and-modes-revealed|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: Multiplayer Maps and Modes Revealed|last=Osborn|first=Alex|date=September 26, 2017|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n*'''Galactic Assault''': This game mode is centered around unique set pieces set across the thirteen planets and locations featuring all three ''Star Wars'' eras involving a team of 20 attackers against 20 defenders, with the attackers having to complete a specific objective in order to progress, whereas the defenders have to stop them.\n*'''Supremacy''': This mode pits two teams of twenty players, with an additional 12 AI bots per team, against each other as they fight to capture and hold a majority of Command Posts which increase reinforcement count in order to attack the enemy team's capital ship and destroy it from within by capturing and destroying objectives. It is a new mode that was introduced in March 2019. The mode is currently available in the \"Age of the Republic\" and the \" Age of the Resistance\" eras, and will soon be available in as the \"Age of the Rebellion\".\n*'''Heroes vs. Villains''': This mode involves all the heroes and villains in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'', where four light side heroes fight four dark side villains.

This comes with an improvement in Battlefront's AI as the enemy bots can play as heroes and some reinforcements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/20/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2-update-new-modes-dlc-rise-of-skywalker/|title=Star Wars Battlefront II adding co-op, new maps and modes \u2013 TheSixthAxis|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n*'''Hero Showdown''': This mode involves teams of two heroes and two villains facing off in round-based duels with no respawn after defeat until the next round begins.

To win, the player's team must control the battlefront by securing the most command posts, thereby accruing points. Unlike the similar multiplayer mode \u2018Supremacy\u2019, the match ends when a team accrues the maximum number of points.\n*'''Custom Arcade:''' A smaller scale mode where players take on AI in a choice of Team Battles, Starfighter Battles, Onslaught or Starfighter Onslaught. Team Battles are where the player faces a small team of AI Troopers, while Starfighter Battles is where the player takes on a team of AI ships. Onslaught is where you pick a hero or villain, and you must wipe out the enemy team of AI Troopers in the time limit you choose, while Starfighter Onslaught is the same but with ships.\n*'''Battle Scenarios:''' A set of classic encounters across all eras of ''Star Wars'', which also grant the player rewards for the multiplayer experience.\n\nUnlike 2015's [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|''Battlefront'']], the game also offers a single-player campaign. Its protagonist is Iden Versio, leader of an Imperial Special Forces group known as Inferno Squad, who participates in multiple events in the 30 years leading up to [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|''The Force Awakens'']]. There are segments in the campaign where the player is able to control other characters such as Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. Players can also play in the Arcade mode \u2013 an offline single player or local co-op where players can choose which side to play on and which battle to play in. Battles vary from team battles to onslaughts. Alternatively, players can choose to do a custom match, where they can change some of the settings and locations.\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\nInstead of the paid Season Pass [[downloadable content]] (DLC) seen in the game's 2015 predecessor, ''Battlefront II'' is expanded via free DLC provided to all players with a free EA account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-dlc-plans-hinted-in-origi/1100-6450714/|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2's DLC Plans Hinted in Origin Store Page|last=Strawhun|first=Aiden|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mash\" /> The DLC uses a seasonal structure similar to ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege|Rainbow Six Siege]]'', according to Gavankar.

The next set of content was announced on June 9, 2018, during EA Play and was released throughout both 2018 and 2019. It featured content from the prequel trilogy of ''Star Wars'', centering on the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists known as the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], and added the planets Geonosis and Felucia as ground maps, new games modes \"Capital Supremacy\" (inspired by Conquest from the original ''Battlefront'' games), \"Instant Action\" and \"Co-op\" (which were eventually added to all eras), new reinforcements for the Enforcer class (the Clone Commando and the Droideka) and vehicles for the Speeder (the BARC Speeder and the STAP), Armor (the TX-130), and Artillery (the AT-TE, available only on the Geonosis Galactic Assault map) classes, the Infiltrator reinforcement class (initially available only for the Republic and Separatists and represented by the ARC Trooper and the Commando Droid, respectively, but it was eventually added to all three eras), skins for both clone troopers and battle droids, and new Republic heroes Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and Separatists villains General Grievous and Count Dooku.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/09/e3-2018-star-wars-battlefront-2-clone-wars-content-revealed|title=E3 2018: Star Wars Battlefront 2 Clone Wars Content Revealed|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Andrew|date=June 9, 2018|website=IGN|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-clone-wars-voice-actors/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars Voice Actors Returning for Battlefront II Content|last1=Fiduccia|first1=Christopher|date=October 18, 2018|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, a \"Celebration Edition\" of the game was released, which included all cosmetics (skins, emotes, voice lines and victory poses ) for both troopers and heroes released up until then.

Starting with February 2020, new content for the original trilogy era was also released, including new reinforcements for the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire (the Ewok Hunter and the ISB Agent) and new weapons for all four base classes (the E-11D for the Assault, T-21 for Heavy, DL-18 for Officer and Cycler Rifle for Specialist, all of them returning from 2015's ''Battlefront''). A Scarif ground map, inspired by the movie ''[[Rogue One]]'', was also teased and is set to be released in \"mid-April\".<ref name=\"thesixthaxis.com\">https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/23/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-of-scarif-update-delay-april-coronavirus-covid19/</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\nThe single-player story mode campaign in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'' takes place in the [[Star Wars galaxy|''Star Wars'' galaxy]], beginning around the time of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', but is mostly set between it and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''. The player assumes the role of [[Iden Versio]], the commander of an Imperial Special Forces [[commando]] unit called Inferno Squad, which consists of fellow members Del Meeko and Gideon Hask and is supervised by Iden's father, Admiral Garrick Versio. The campaign begins with the Battle of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], where [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] plots to lure an unsuspecting [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] fleet into a trap using himself and the [[Death Star|Death Star II]] as bait, seeking to crush the [[Galactic Civil War|Rebellion]] against his [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] once and for all. Inferno Squad is crucial to the success of this plan, but the Empire underestimates the strength of the Rebellion, as its fleet gathers at [[Sullust]].\n\n===Plot===\n[[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]) is being interrogated for the codes to unlock an Imperial transmission aboard a Rebel [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]. She activates her [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]], which sneaks to her cell and frees her. Iden had allowed herself to be captured in order to erase the Imperial transmission, which would reveal the Emperor's plan at Endor. She successfully erases it, then escapes the ship by launching herself into space where she is intercepted by the ''Corvus'', the flagship of Inferno Squad. Iden confirms the mission's success to Gideon Hask ([[Paul Blackthorne]]) and Del Meeko ([[TJ Ramini]]), other members of her squad.\n\nLater on Endor, Iden, Hask, and Del secure the perimeter around the ruined shield generator, and watch with shock and horror as the Death Star II explodes. Vice Admiral [[Rae Sloane|Sloane]] orders a full retreat, and Inferno Squad recovers [[TIE fighter]]s to escape the moon, which is being overrun by Rebel forces. The ''Corvus'' is attacked during their escape, but Inferno fends off the Rebel bombers. Iden then meets with her father, Admiral Garrick Versio ([[Anthony Skordi]]), on his [[Star Destroyer]], the ''Eviscerator''. Admiral Versio confirms to Iden that the Emperor has died, before a messenger droid displays a hologram of the late Emperor issuing his last command: to begin Operation: Cinder. Admiral Versio sends Iden to an Imperial shipyard over Fondor to protect Moff Raythe and his Star Destroyer, the ''Dauntless'', which hosts experimental satellites vital to the success of Operation: Cinder. The ''Dauntless'' comes under attack from a Rebel Star Cruiser, but Iden is able to board it with Hask and disable its ion cannons. Afterwards, they are ordered to attack the Imperial shipyard in order to free the Star Destroyer from the locked clamps, allowing it to open fire on the Rebel cruiser and destroy it.\n\nDel is sent to Pillio and ordered to destroy one of the Emperor's hidden bases. He encounters [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), who helps him disarm the base's defenses and fend off the local wildlife, before eventually entering the base and discovering that it contains the Emperor's spoils of conquest. Del and Luke part amicably, and the former begins to question the Empire's goals and motives. Following this, Iden and Inferno Squad are sent to the Imperial-controlled world of Vardos (and Iden's homeworld), in order to retrieve Protectorate Gleb. As the satellites for Operation Cinder begin destroying the planet with terrible storms, Iden and Meeko go against their orders and try to evacuate the civilians in addition to Gleb, causing Hask to betray them. Disillusioned by the Empire's attack on Vardos, Iden and Meeko escape off world, now traitors to the Empire. They seek out the Rebel Alliance and are taken to General [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), who gives them the choice to help stop Operation: Cinder, or to escape and make new lives for themselves. Choosing to help, they aid [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]) in protecting [[Naboo]], destroying the satellites for Operation: Cinder and reactivating the planet's defenses. After Naboo is liberated, Inferno Squad joins the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]].\n\nSeveral months later, Inferno Squad, now consisting of Iden, Del and Shriv Suurgav (Dan Donohue), are sent by Leia to [[Takodana]] to find [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), who was extracting an Imperial defector carrying critical data in hopes of liberating [[Kashyyyk]] and freeing the [[Wookiee]]s. The data also reveals that Admiral Versio is commanding Imperial operations on [[Bespin]] and Sullust. Iden and Del infiltrate Bespin with the intent of capturing Admiral Versio, but are led into a trap by Hask, who escapes along with the Admiral. Iden and Del soon manage to escape from Bespin as well, destroying a Star Destroyer fuelling station in the process. Meanwhile, Lando and Shriv investigate the hidden Imperial weapons cache on Sullust, only to find a weapons factory, which they destroy.\n\nThese operations cripple the Imperial fleet, which makes a last stand at [[Jakku]]. During the battle, Iden shoots down Hask and boards the ''Eviscerator'', intending to rescue her father. Admiral Versio decides to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], feeling obligated to die with the Empire he fought to protect, and urges Iden to escape and live a new life, commending her for seeing the weakness of the Empire. Iden takes an escape pod and reunites with Del at the end of the battle. The two embrace and kiss, as the battle marks the end of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThree decades later, Del is captured on Pillio by Protectorate Gleb, who hands him over to [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]. Ren uses the Force to interrogate Del about the location of the map leading to Luke Skywalker. After succeeding, he leaves Del in the custody of Hask, who survived getting shot down at Jakku years prior. Hask expresses disgust at Del choosing to father a daughter with Iden instead of becoming a soldier and kills him, but not before Del warns him not to confront Iden. Hask then warns Gleb that the Republic cannot find out about \"Project Resurrection\" and orders her to leave the ''Corvus'' on Pillio as bait to lure Iden out of hiding.\n\n===Resurrection===\nShriv Suurgav, now an agent for the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], discovers the abandoned ''Corvus'' and informs Iden and her daughter, Zay (Brittany Volcy). Shriv also reveals that Del had been helping the Resistance investigate rumors of mass disappearances that may be connected to Project Resurrection before disappearing himself. They head to Athulla, where Del was last seen, to investigate. However, they are ambushed by a Jinata Security fleet. Iden and Zay destroy the fleet and capture the flagship. The surviving Jinata Security crew admit that they had been kidnapping children on the behalf of the First Order, and that Project Resurrection had been moved to Vardos.\n\nThe group travels to Vardos, where Iden has Zay stay behind on the ''Corvus'' while she and Shriv investigate the surface. After seeing a bright streak of red light appear in the sky, Iden and Shriv discover Gleb's dead body and are then captured by Hask, who taunts them by telling them that he killed Gleb and Del and that the First Order has already destroyed the Senate and the Hosnian system (the capital of the New Republic), revealing that the red streak of light seen earlier was actually the deadly blast of [[Starkiller Base]] (as seen in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens#Plot|The Force Awakens]]''). He then orders his Star Destroyer, the ''Retribution'', to destroy the ''Corvus'' along with Zay. Jinata Security personnel, angry at the First Order for betraying them, attack Hask's men, giving Iden and Shriv an opportunity to escape. They rescue Zay, who managed to eject in an escape pod before the ''Corvus'' was destroyed.\n\nIden fights her desire to get revenge on Hask, then resolves to board the ''Retribution'' to investigate what the First Order had been up to. After getting aboard by flying stolen TIE Fighters into its engine, Iden, Shriv and Zay search the ''Retribution'' for any useful data from the ship to aid the Resistance, fending off the ship's personnel along the way. They hack a computer terminal and discover that Project Resurrection is an operation by the First Order to kidnap children from across the galaxy and indoctrinate them into [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]]. In addition, they discover that the First Order has built up a massive fleet large enough to retake the galaxy. Finally, they find the plans for a First Order Dreadnought and steal them. Shriv then goes to secure an escape craft while Iden and Zay plant explosive charges on the ''Retribution'''s hyperspace generators. Hask ambushes them but is killed by Iden. The destruction of the hyperspace generators pulls the ''Retribution'' out of hyperspace near Starkiller Base just as the Resistance destroys it. Iden reveals that she had been mortally wounded during the battle with Hask and gives the Dreadnought plans to Zay, ordering her to escape without her before dying.\n\nZay and Shriv link up with the Resistance and transmit the Dreadnought plans to General Leia. She then orders them to head to the Outer Rim to gather more allies.\n\n==Post-launch content==\nIt was confirmed during EA Play 2017 that there would not be a season pass; rather, all downloadable content will be free for all players and will be included in events called Seasons.<ref name=\"EAPlayLive\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Bta5UNTHw|title=E3 2017: EA Press Conference and EA Play \u2013 IGN LIVE|accessdate=June 11, 2017|author=IGN|date=June 10, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Last Jedi'' Season ===\nThe first Season expansion, ''The Last Jedi'' Season, was released on December 5 and is centered around [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], the eighth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga which was released on December 15, 2017.

game]] based on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film franchise. It is the fourth major installment of the ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' series and seventh overall, and a sequel to the [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|2015 reboot of the series]]. It was developed by [[EA DICE]], in collaboration with [[Criterion Games]] and [[Motive Studios]], and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was released worldwide on November 17, 2017 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nUpon release, ''Battlefront II'' received mixed reviews from critics. The game was also subject to [[List of video games notable for negative reception|widespread criticism]] regarding the status of its [[loot box]]es, which could give players [[Pay to win|substantial gameplay advantages]] if purchased with real money.

The available maps at launch included [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]], [[Kashyyyk]], [[Naboo]] (for the prequel trilogy), the [[Death Star|Death Star II]], [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], [[Yavin IV]], [[Hoth]], the [[Mos Eisley|Mos Eisley Spaceport]] on [[Tatooine]] (for the original trilogy), [[Jakku]], [[Takodana]] and [[Starkiller Base]] (for the sequel trilogy), as well as a smaller-scale Cloud City map on [[Bespin]] and space maps over Kamino, [[Ryloth]] (for the prequel trilogy), Fondor, Endor (for the original trilogy) and the Unknown Regions (for the sequel trilogy).

The game offers a variety of unique game modes, most of which have the player take control of four main ground classes (Assault, Heavy, Officer and Specialist), aligned to either the [[Galactic Republic]] (represented by [[clone trooper]]s), the Separatists ([[battle droids]]), the Rebel Alliance (Rebel troopers), the Empire ([[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]]), the Resistance (Resistance troopers), or the First Order (First Order stormtroopers), and compete in large or small scale battles against other players (or, in some cases, enemies controlled by an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]).\n\nIn space battles, the players take control of space ships rather than ground troopers or vehicles, but the play style is more or less the same, also being class-based. The are a total of three base classes for the space battles:\n\n*'''Fighter''' - represented by the [[ARC-170]] Starfighter and, on Naboo only, the [[Naboo starfighter|N-1]] Starfighter for the Republic; the [[Vulture droid|Vulture Droid]] for the Separatists; the [[X-wing fighter|T-65B X-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE fighter|TIE/ln Fighter]] for the Empire; the T-70 X-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/fo Fighter for the First Order.\n*'''Interceptor''' - the [[V-Wing Starfighter|V-Wing]] for the Republic; the [[Droid tri-fighter|Droid Tri-Fighter]] for the Separatists; the [[A-wing|RZ-1 A-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE interceptor|TIE/IN Interceptor]] for the Empire; the RZ-2 A-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/sf Fighter for the First Order\n*'''Bomber''' - the [[Y-wing|BTL-B Y-Wing]] for the Republic; the ''Hyena''-class bomber for the Separatists; the BTL-A4 Y-Wing for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[TIE Bomber|TIE/sa Bomber]] for the Empire\n\nThere are also six additional \"reinforcement\" classes, that are unlocked during every match by acquiring battlepoints (earned from defeating enemies or completing specific objectives during each match). For the ground troopers, there are three reinforcement classes:\n\n*'''Enforcer''' - the [[Wookiee]] Warrior and [[Clone commando|Clone Commando]] for the Republic; the [[Super Battle Droid|B2 Super Battle Droid]] and the [[Droideka (Star Wars)|Droideka]] for the Separatists; the Wookie Warrior for the Rebel Allaince; the [[Deathtrooper|Death Trooper]] for the Empire; the Ovissian Gunner for the Resistance; and the First Order Flametrooper.\n*'''Aerial''' - the Jet Trooper for the Republic; B2-RP Rocket Droid for the Separatists; the Rebel Rocket-Jumper; the Imperial Rocket Trooper; the Resistance Rocket-Jumper; and the First Order Jet Trooper.\n*'''Infiltrator''' - the [[Advanced Recon Commando]] / ARC Trooper for the Republic; the Commando Droid for the Separatists; the [[Ewok]] Hunter for the Rebel Alliance; the ISB Agent for the Empire; the Caphex Spy for the Resistance; and the Sith Trooper for the First Order.\n\nThe other three reinforcements are vehicles:\n\n*'''Speeder''' - the [[BARC Speeder]] for the Republic; the [[Speeder bike|STAP]] for the Separatists; the T-47 Airspeeder / [[Snowspeeder]], X-34 [[Landspeeder]] and 74-Z [[Speeder bike|Speeder Bike]] for the Rebel Alliance; the 74-Z Speeder Bike for the Empire; a stolen LIUV / First Order Snowspeeder and the V-4X-D Ski Speeder for the Resistance; and the LIUV for the First Order.\n*'''Artillery''' - the [[LAAT]] Gunship and the [[AT-TE]] for the Republic; the [[MTT (Star Wars)|MTT]] for the Separatists; the [[U-wing|U-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[At at|AT-AT]] for the Empire.\n*'''Armor''' - the [[AT-RT]] and the [[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank|TX-130]] for the Republic; the [[Armored Assault Tank|AAT]] for the Separatists; the AT-RT for the Rebel Alliance; the [[AT-ST]] for the Empire; a stolen First Order AT-ST for the Resistance; and the First Order AT-ST.\n\n=== Heroes ===\n''Battlefront II'' allows the players to take control of several heroes and villains based on iconic characters from across all the ''Star Wars'' movies. At launch, the hero roster included [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]), [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), [[Chewbacca]], [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), [[Yoda]] ([[Tom Kane]]), and [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]), while the villain roster included [[Darth Vader]] ([[Matt Sloan (voice actor)|Matt Sloan]]), [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Sam Witwer]]), [[Boba Fett]] ([[Temuera Morrison]]), [[Bossk (Star Wars)|Bossk]] ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]), [[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]), [[Darth Maul]] (Sam Witwer), and [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]/[[Roger Craig Smith]]).\n\nThere are also several hero and villain ships, which at launch included Boba Fett's ''[[Slave I]]'', Darth Maul's ''[[Sith Infiltrator|Scimitar]]'', Darth Vader's [[TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced x1]], Han Solo and Chewbacca's ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Iden Versio's [[TIE fighter|TIE/in Fighter]], Kylo Ren's TIE Silencer, Luke Skywalker's T-65B [[X-wing fighter|X-Wing]], [[Poe Dameron]]'s T-70 X-Wing, Rey and Chewbacca's ''Millennium Falcon'', and Yoda's [[Jedi interceptor|Actis-class Light Interceptor]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kae-JjbLsgA|title=Star Wars Battlefront II: Full Length Reveal Trailer|date=April 15, 2017|last=EA Star Wars|accessdate=April 16, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNew heroes and hero ships from across all eras were added later on, including [[Tallie Lintra]]'s RZ-2 A-Wing, Lando Calrissian and [[L3-37]]'s ''Millennium Falcon'' (from ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''), [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[James Arnold Taylor]]), Anakin Skywalker ([[Matt Lanter]]), [[General Grievous]] (Matthew Wood), [[Count Dooku]] ([[Corey Burton]]), [[BB-8]] and [[BB-9E]].\n\n=== Progression System ===\nThe game features a progression system based on \"Star Cards\", which are unlocked as the player levels up with a specific class or hero and grant them specific benefits. Players level up by defeating enemies or completing objectives during each match. Each class or hero can have a maximum of three Star Cards equipped, and each Star Card can be leveled up to level 4, each level further increasing its benefits. There are also milestones, which grant the player rewards for completing specific tasks, or for simply leveling up with a class or a hero.\n\nFor the four base trooper classes, there are up to four unlockable weapons, which are unlocked by completing specific milestones and each have their particular advantages, such as improved range, damage or fire rate. Each weapon also comes with modifications, which improve specific stats and are also unlocked by completing milestones.\n\n=== Multiplayer modes ===\nThere are a total of twelve online multiplayer game modes, some of which are available to play only for a limited time, with the largest supporting up to 40 simultaneous players with 24 additional AI-controlled players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/26/star-wars-battlefront-2-multiplayer-maps-and-modes-revealed|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: Multiplayer Maps and Modes Revealed|last=Osborn|first=Alex|date=September 26, 2017|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n*'''Galactic Assault''': This game mode is centered around unique set pieces set across the thirteen planets and locations featuring all three ''Star Wars'' eras involving a team of 20 attackers against 20 defenders, with the attackers having to complete a specific objective in order to progress, whereas the defenders have to stop them.\n*'''Supremacy''': This mode pits two teams of twenty players, with an additional 12 AI bots per team, against each other as they fight to capture and hold a majority of Command Posts which increase reinforcement count in order to attack the enemy team's capital ship and destroy it from within by capturing and destroying objectives. It is a new mode that was introduced in March 2019. The mode is currently available in the \"Age of the Republic\" and the \" Age of the Resistance\" eras, and will soon be available in as the \"Age of the Rebellion\".\n*'''Heroes vs. Villains''': This mode involves all the heroes and villains in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'', where four light side heroes fight four dark side villains. A deathmatch mode which involves one team of four hero's fighting against a team of four villains, with the first team to 35 kills wins. In the original game mode, one of the four heroes and one of the four villains are selected to be the target to attack. The first team to defeat the enemy team's chosen targets 10 times wins, however the target system was removed in May 2019 in favor of a new mode.\n*'''Co-op''': This game mode is a Player vs. Entity mode, pitting a team of four players and AI bots against another team of AI bots, the aim being to capture one of between one and three command posts on each of the three or four stages (depending on the map). The players can either attack or defend. This comes with an improvement in Battlefront's AI as the enemy bots can play as heroes and some reinforcements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/20/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2-update-new-modes-dlc-rise-of-skywalker/|title=Star Wars Battlefront II adding co-op, new maps and modes \u2013 TheSixthAxis|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n*'''Hero Showdown''': This mode involves teams of two heroes and two villains facing off in round-based duels with no respawn after defeat until the next round begins.

The first team to win three rounds wins. The mode was introduced to the game in July 2018.\n*'''Strike''': Strike has players battling in close quarter scenarios involving a team of eight attackers aiming to either capture a unique objective from a team of eight defenders \u2013 essentially one team [[capture the flag]] \u2013 or arm and destroy two objectives.\n*'''Blast''': Blast is a standard [[team deathmatch]] between two teams of eight players in which teams try to reach 100 total combined eliminations before the enemy team can.\n*'''Ewok Hunt''': This mode, introduced as part of the game's April update, has two Ewoks hunt down a group of eighteen stormtroopers; each stormtrooper defeated spawns as another Ewok.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/ewok-hunt-is-battlefront-2s-best-mode/|title=Ewok Hunt is Battlefront 2's best mode|last=Petitte|first=Omri|date=June 10, 2018|work=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref> It was on rotation with Jetpack Cargo originally as a limited time mode but was later made permanent.\n*'''Extraction''': This game mode, which was released on June 12, 2018, has an attacking team escort cargo through several checkpoints to their final destination while the defending team tries to stop them.

To win, the player's team must control the battlefront by securing the most command posts, thereby accruing points. Unlike the similar multiplayer mode \u2018Supremacy\u2019, the match ends when a team accrues the maximum number of points.\n*'''Custom Arcade:''' A smaller scale mode where players take on AI in a choice of Team Battles, Starfighter Battles, Onslaught or Starfighter Onslaught. Team Battles are where the player faces a small team of AI Troopers, while Starfighter Battles is where the player takes on a team of AI ships. Onslaught is where you pick a hero or villain, and you must wipe out the enemy team of AI Troopers in the time limit you choose, while Starfighter Onslaught is the same but with ships.\n*'''Battle Scenarios:''' A set of classic encounters across all eras of ''Star Wars'', which also grant the player rewards for the multiplayer experience.\n\nUnlike 2015's [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|''Battlefront'']], the game also offers a single-player campaign. Its protagonist is Iden Versio, leader of an Imperial Special Forces group known as Inferno Squad, who participates in multiple events in the 30 years leading up to [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|''The Force Awakens'']]. There are segments in the campaign where the player is able to control other characters such as Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. Players can also play in the Arcade mode \u2013 an offline single player or local co-op where players can choose which side to play on and which battle to play in. Battles vary from team battles to onslaughts. Alternatively, players can choose to do a custom match, where they can change some of the settings and locations.\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\nInstead of the paid Season Pass [[downloadable content]] (DLC) seen in the game's 2015 predecessor, ''Battlefront II'' is expanded via free DLC provided to all players with a free EA account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-dlc-plans-hinted-in-origi/1100-6450714/|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2's DLC Plans Hinted in Origin Store Page|last=Strawhun|first=Aiden|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mash\" /> The DLC uses a seasonal structure similar to ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege|Rainbow Six Siege]]'', according to Gavankar.

Furthermore, a fourth season was released, based on the movie ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'', and added the planet Ajan Kloss as a new ground map, new reinforcements for the Resistance and the First Order (the Ovissian Gunner, the Caphex Spy, a new First Order Jet Trooper, and the Sith Trooper), and later, in January 2020, BB-8 as a new hero and BB-9E as a villain. Starting with February 2020, new content for the original trilogy era was also released, including new reinforcements for the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire (the Ewok Hunter and the ISB Agent) and new weapons for all four base classes (the E-11D for the Assault, T-21 for Heavy, DL-18 for Officer and Cycler Rifle for Specialist, all of them returning from 2015's ''Battlefront''). A Scarif ground map, inspired by the movie ''[[Rogue One]]'', was also teased and is set to be released in \"mid-April\".<ref name=\"thesixthaxis.com\">https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/23/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-of-scarif-update-delay-april-coronavirus-covid19/</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\nThe single-player story mode campaign in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'' takes place in the [[Star Wars galaxy|''Star Wars'' galaxy]], beginning around the time of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', but is mostly set between it and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''. The player assumes the role of [[Iden Versio]], the commander of an Imperial Special Forces [[commando]] unit called Inferno Squad, which consists of fellow members Del Meeko and Gideon Hask and is supervised by Iden's father, Admiral Garrick Versio. The campaign begins with the Battle of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], where [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] plots to lure an unsuspecting [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] fleet into a trap using himself and the [[Death Star|Death Star II]] as bait, seeking to crush the [[Galactic Civil War|Rebellion]] against his [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] once and for all. Inferno Squad is crucial to the success of this plan, but the Empire underestimates the strength of the Rebellion, as its fleet gathers at [[Sullust]].\n\n===Plot===\n[[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]) is being interrogated for the codes to unlock an Imperial transmission aboard a Rebel [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]. She activates her [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]], which sneaks to her cell and frees her. Iden had allowed herself to be captured in order to erase the Imperial transmission, which would reveal the Emperor's plan at Endor. She successfully erases it, then escapes the ship by launching herself into space where she is intercepted by the ''Corvus'', the flagship of Inferno Squad. Iden confirms the mission's success to Gideon Hask ([[Paul Blackthorne]]) and Del Meeko ([[TJ Ramini]]), other members of her squad.\n\nLater on Endor, Iden, Hask, and Del secure the perimeter around the ruined shield generator, and watch with shock and horror as the Death Star II explodes. Vice Admiral [[Rae Sloane|Sloane]] orders a full retreat, and Inferno Squad recovers [[TIE fighter]]s to escape the moon, which is being overrun by Rebel forces. The ''Corvus'' is attacked during their escape, but Inferno fends off the Rebel bombers. Iden then meets with her father, Admiral Garrick Versio ([[Anthony Skordi]]), on his [[Star Destroyer]], the ''Eviscerator''. Admiral Versio confirms to Iden that the Emperor has died, before a messenger droid displays a hologram of the late Emperor issuing his last command: to begin Operation: Cinder. Admiral Versio sends Iden to an Imperial shipyard over Fondor to protect Moff Raythe and his Star Destroyer, the ''Dauntless'', which hosts experimental satellites vital to the success of Operation: Cinder. The ''Dauntless'' comes under attack from a Rebel Star Cruiser, but Iden is able to board it with Hask and disable its ion cannons. Afterwards, they are ordered to attack the Imperial shipyard in order to free the Star Destroyer from the locked clamps, allowing it to open fire on the Rebel cruiser and destroy it.\n\nDel is sent to Pillio and ordered to destroy one of the Emperor's hidden bases. He encounters [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), who helps him disarm the base's defenses and fend off the local wildlife, before eventually entering the base and discovering that it contains the Emperor's spoils of conquest. Del and Luke part amicably, and the former begins to question the Empire's goals and motives. Following this, Iden and Inferno Squad are sent to the Imperial-controlled world of Vardos (and Iden's homeworld), in order to retrieve Protectorate Gleb. As the satellites for Operation Cinder begin destroying the planet with terrible storms, Iden and Meeko go against their orders and try to evacuate the civilians in addition to Gleb, causing Hask to betray them. Disillusioned by the Empire's attack on Vardos, Iden and Meeko escape off world, now traitors to the Empire. They seek out the Rebel Alliance and are taken to General [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), who gives them the choice to help stop Operation: Cinder, or to escape and make new lives for themselves. Choosing to help, they aid [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]) in protecting [[Naboo]], destroying the satellites for Operation: Cinder and reactivating the planet's defenses. After Naboo is liberated, Inferno Squad joins the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]].\n\nSeveral months later, Inferno Squad, now consisting of Iden, Del and Shriv Suurgav (Dan Donohue), are sent by Leia to [[Takodana]] to find [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), who was extracting an Imperial defector carrying critical data in hopes of liberating [[Kashyyyk]] and freeing the [[Wookiee]]s. The data also reveals that Admiral Versio is commanding Imperial operations on [[Bespin]] and Sullust. Iden and Del infiltrate Bespin with the intent of capturing Admiral Versio, but are led into a trap by Hask, who escapes along with the Admiral. Iden and Del soon manage to escape from Bespin as well, destroying a Star Destroyer fuelling station in the process. Meanwhile, Lando and Shriv investigate the hidden Imperial weapons cache on Sullust, only to find a weapons factory, which they destroy.\n\nThese operations cripple the Imperial fleet, which makes a last stand at [[Jakku]]. During the battle, Iden shoots down Hask and boards the ''Eviscerator'', intending to rescue her father. Admiral Versio decides to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], feeling obligated to die with the Empire he fought to protect, and urges Iden to escape and live a new life, commending her for seeing the weakness of the Empire. Iden takes an escape pod and reunites with Del at the end of the battle. The two embrace and kiss, as the battle marks the end of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThree decades later, Del is captured on Pillio by Protectorate Gleb, who hands him over to [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]. Ren uses the Force to interrogate Del about the location of the map leading to Luke Skywalker. After succeeding, he leaves Del in the custody of Hask, who survived getting shot down at Jakku years prior. Hask expresses disgust at Del choosing to father a daughter with Iden instead of becoming a soldier and kills him, but not before Del warns him not to confront Iden. Hask then warns Gleb that the Republic cannot find out about \"Project Resurrection\" and orders her to leave the ''Corvus'' on Pillio as bait to lure Iden out of hiding.\n\n===Resurrection===\nShriv Suurgav, now an agent for the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], discovers the abandoned ''Corvus'' and informs Iden and her daughter, Zay (Brittany Volcy). Shriv also reveals that Del had been helping the Resistance investigate rumors of mass disappearances that may be connected to Project Resurrection before disappearing himself. They head to Athulla, where Del was last seen, to investigate. However, they are ambushed by a Jinata Security fleet. Iden and Zay destroy the fleet and capture the flagship. The surviving Jinata Security crew admit that they had been kidnapping children on the behalf of the First Order, and that Project Resurrection had been moved to Vardos.\n\nThe group travels to Vardos, where Iden has Zay stay behind on the ''Corvus'' while she and Shriv investigate the surface. After seeing a bright streak of red light appear in the sky, Iden and Shriv discover Gleb's dead body and are then captured by Hask, who taunts them by telling them that he killed Gleb and Del and that the First Order has already destroyed the Senate and the Hosnian system (the capital of the New Republic), revealing that the red streak of light seen earlier was actually the deadly blast of [[Starkiller Base]] (as seen in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens#Plot|The Force Awakens]]''). He then orders his Star Destroyer, the ''Retribution'', to destroy the ''Corvus'' along with Zay. Jinata Security personnel, angry at the First Order for betraying them, attack Hask's men, giving Iden and Shriv an opportunity to escape. They rescue Zay, who managed to eject in an escape pod before the ''Corvus'' was destroyed.\n\nIden fights her desire to get revenge on Hask, then resolves to board the ''Retribution'' to investigate what the First Order had been up to. After getting aboard by flying stolen TIE Fighters into its engine, Iden, Shriv and Zay search the ''Retribution'' for any useful data from the ship to aid the Resistance, fending off the ship's personnel along the way. They hack a computer terminal and discover that Project Resurrection is an operation by the First Order to kidnap children from across the galaxy and indoctrinate them into [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]]. In addition, they discover that the First Order has built up a massive fleet large enough to retake the galaxy. Finally, they find the plans for a First Order Dreadnought and steal them. Shriv then goes to secure an escape craft while Iden and Zay plant explosive charges on the ''Retribution'''s hyperspace generators. Hask ambushes them but is killed by Iden. The destruction of the hyperspace generators pulls the ''Retribution'' out of hyperspace near Starkiller Base just as the Resistance destroys it. Iden reveals that she had been mortally wounded during the battle with Hask and gives the Dreadnought plans to Zay, ordering her to escape without her before dying.\n\nZay and Shriv link up with the Resistance and transmit the Dreadnought plans to General Leia. She then orders them to head to the Outer Rim to gather more allies.\n\n==Post-launch content==\nIt was confirmed during EA Play 2017 that there would not be a season pass; rather, all downloadable content will be free for all players and will be included in events called Seasons.<ref name=\"EAPlayLive\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Bta5UNTHw|title=E3 2017: EA Press Conference and EA Play \u2013 IGN LIVE|accessdate=June 11, 2017|author=IGN|date=June 10, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Last Jedi'' Season ===\nThe first Season expansion, ''The Last Jedi'' Season, was released on December 5 and is centered around [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], the eighth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga which was released on December 15, 2017.

On [[Earth]], clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its [[dew point]], or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of [[water vapor]]) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.\n\nThey are seen in the Earth's [[homosphere]] (which includes the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], and [[mesosphere]]). Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the [[cloud physics]] branch of [[meteorology]].\n\nThe two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the atmosphere are Latin and common. Cloud types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have [[Latin]] names due to the universal adoption of [[Luke Howard]]'s [[nomenclature]]. Formally proposed in 1802, it became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical ''forms'' that appear in any or all of three altitude ''levels'' (formerly known as [[Etage|''\u00e9tages'']]). These physical types, in approximate ascending order of convective activity, include ''stratiform'' sheets, ''cirriform'' wisps and patches, ''stratocumuliform'' layers (mainly structured as rolls, ripples, and patches), ''cumuliform'' heaps, and very large ''cumulonimbiform'' heaps that often show complex structures. The physical forms are divided by altitude levels into 10 basic genus-types.\n\nThe Latin names for applicable ''high-level'' genera in the troposphere carry a ''cirro''- prefix, and an ''alto''- prefix is added to the names of the ''mid-level'' genus-types. Clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as ''low-'' or ''mid-level'' according to the altitude range at which each initially forms. However they are also more informally classified as ''multi-level'' or ''vertical'', which along with low level clouds, do not carry any altitude related prefixes. Most of the genera can be subdivided into ''species'' and further subdivided into ''varieties''. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names.\n\nSeveral cloud types that form higher up in the stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types, which may have the appearance of stratiform sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other [[planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the [[Solar System]] and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[sulfuric acid]], as well as water.\n\nThe tabular overview that follows is very broad in scope. It draws from several methods of cloud classification, both formal and informal, used in different levels of the Earth's homosphere by a number of cited authorities. Despite some differences in methodologies and terminologies, the classification schemes seen in this article can be harmonized by using an informal cross-classification of physical forms and altitude levels to derive the 10 tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure which can affect both forms and levels. This table should not be seen as a strict or singular classification, but as an illustration of how various major cloud types are related to each other and defined through a full range of altitude levels from Earth's surface to the \"edge of space\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Forms and levels !!

Around the beginning of the 13th century, the word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds, because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud. Over time, the metaphoric usage of the word supplanted the Old English ''weolcan'', which had been the literal term for clouds in general.<ref name=Harper>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cloud |title=Cloud |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2012 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cloud |title=Cloud |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n\nAncient cloud studies were not made in isolation, but were observed in combination with other [[weather]] elements and even other natural sciences. Around 340 BC, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word ''meteoros'', meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word came the modern term [[meteorology]], the study of clouds and weather. ''Meteorologica'' was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way, especially the [[hydrological cycle]].<ref name=\"Meteorologica\">{{cite journal |last=Frisinger |first=H.

Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language, and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting. Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of [[France]] because it used unusual French names for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds, and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803.<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=International Cloud Atlas, preface to the 1939 edition |volume=I |year=1975 |url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ IX\u2013XIII] |isbn=978-92-63-10407-6 |accessdate=6 December 2014 }}</ref> As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, German dramatist and poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard. An elaboration of Howard's system was eventually formally adopted by the International Meteorological Conference in 1891.<ref name=\"Preface\"/> This system covered only the tropospheric cloud types, but the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th century eventually led to the creation of separate classification schemes using common names for these very high clouds, which were still broadly silar to some cloud forms identiified in the troposphhere.<ref name=\"Polar-stratospheric\"/>\n\n== Formation in the homosphere: How air becomes saturated ==\n{{main|Cloud physics}}\n[[File:Cumulus humilis clouds in Ukraine.jpg|thumb|[[Cumulus Clouds]] in May]]\n\nTerrestrial clouds can be found throughout most of the homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.

Despite this hierarchy, a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus, especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level.

''Virga'' is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.<ref name=\"features\"/>\n\nWhen the precipitation reaches the ground without completely evaporating, it is designated as the feature ''praecipitatio''.<ref name=\"Dunlop77-78\">{{harvnb|Dunlop|2003|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, ''upward-growing'' cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while ''downward growing'' nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, has the capacity to produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.<ref name=\"clouds - species and varieties\"/><ref name=\"Aerographer2012\"/><ref name=\"features\"/>\n\n====Cloud-based supplementary features====\n''Incus'' is the most type-specific supplementary feature, seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus.

It is also sometimes called ''mammatus'', an earlier version of the term used before a standardization of Latin nomenclature brought about by the World Meteorological Organization during the 20th century.

Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A ''murus'' feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes.

It is formed by the warm, humid [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or [[scud (cloud)|scud]] clouds and does not rotate.<ref name=ICA2017/>\n\n==== Mother clouds ====\n[[File:Port of Piraeus Panoramic View.JPG|left|thumb|Cumulus partly spreading into stratocumulus cumulogenitus over the port of [[Piraeus]] in Greece ]]\n\nClouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a ''mother cloud''. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus, it is termed a ''genitus'' cloud. One example of this is ''stratocumulus cumulogenitus'', a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it is considered to be a ''mutatus'' cloud.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Mother clouds, International Cloud Atlas|year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/principles-of-cloud-classification-mother-clouds.html|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Sunset and Clouds.jpg|thumb|Cumulonimbus mother cloud dissipating into stratocumulus cumulonimbogenitus at dusk]]\n\n====Other genitus and mutatus clouds====\n\nThe genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term ''flammagenitus'' (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level \"pyrocumulus\" or \"fumulus\" clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus ''homogenitus'' (Latin for 'man-made'). [[Contrail]]s formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling cirrus which are designated cirrus ''homogenitus''.  If a cirrus homogenitus cloud changes fully to any of the high-level genera, they are termed cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus ''homomutatus''. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. ''Silvagenitus'' (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest canopy.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\"/>\n\n==== Stratocumulus fields ====\nStratocumulus clouds can be organized into \"fields\" that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics. In general, these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level.

As a result, the [[cloud base]] can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much [[light]] is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance. However, a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity.<ref name=\"Luminance\"/>\n\nAs a tropospheric cloud matures, the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as [[rain]]. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]/[[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.<ref name=\"Bette Hileman\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v073n007.p033| title = Clouds absorb more solar radiation than researchers previously thought| journal = Chemical & Engineering News| volume = 73| issue = 7| pages = 33| year = 1995| last1 = Hileman | first1 = B. }}</ref>\n\nStriking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude, with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident light.<ref name=\"Coloration\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Coloration, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/appearance-of-clouds-colour.html |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> During daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky, tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath. Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their [[Natural environment|environment]] or background. Red, orange, and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise/sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. When the sun is just below the horizon, low-level clouds are gray, middle clouds appear rose-colored, and high clouds are white or off-white. Clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky, or whitish when illuminated by the moon. They may also reflect the colors of large fires, city lights, or auroras that might be present.<ref name=\"Coloration\"/>\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color.

Supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this.

First and foremost, they are the source of precipitation, thereby greatly influencing the distribution and amount of precipitation. Because of their differential buoyancy relative to surrounding cloud-free air, clouds can be associated with vertical motions of the air that may be convective, frontal, or cyclonic. The motion is upward if the clouds are less dense because condensation of water vapor releases heat, warming the air and thereby decreasing its density. This can lead to downward motion because lifting of the air results in cooling that increases its density. All of these effects are subtly dependent on the vertical temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere and result in major redistribution of heat that affect the Earth's climate.<ref name=\"cloud-heating\"/>\n\nThe complexity and diversity of clouds in the troposphere is a major reason for difficulty in quantifying the effects of clouds on climate and climate change. On the one hand, white cloud tops promote cooling of Earth's surface by reflecting shortwave radiation (visible and near infrared) from the sun, diminishing the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed at the surface, enhancing the Earth's [[albedo]]. Most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed, warming the surface, which emits radiation upward at longer, infrared, wavelengths. At these wavelengths, however, water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber. The water reacts by radiating, also in the infrared, both upward and downward, and the downward longwave radiation results in increased warming at the surface. This is analogous to the [[greenhouse effect]] of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[water vapor]].<ref name=\"cloud-heating\">{{cite web|url=http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/role.html|title=Cloud Climatology|website=International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHigh-level genus-types particularly show this duality with both short-wave [[albedo]] cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects.

In a warmer climate more water would enter the atmosphere by evaporation at the surface; as clouds are formed from water vapor, cloudiness would be expected to increase. But in a warmer climate, higher temperatures would tend to evaporate clouds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/|title=A World Without Clouds|first=Natalie|last=Wolchover|website=Quanta Magazine}}</ref> Both of these statements are considered accurate, and both phenomena, known as cloud feedbacks, are found in climate model calculations. Broadly speaking, if clouds, especially low clouds, increase in a warmer climate, the resultant cooling effect leads to a negative feedback in climate response to increased greenhouse gases. But if low clouds decrease, or if high clouds increase, the feedback is positive. Differing amounts of these feedbacks are the principal reason for differences in [[Climate sensitivity|climate sensitivities]] of current global climate models.

(liquid)|droplets]], [[ice crystals|frozen crystals]], or other [[particulates|particles]] suspended in the [[atmosphere]] of a [[planet]]ary body or similar space.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weather Terms

On [[Earth]], clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its [[dew point]], or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of [[water vapor]]) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.\n\nThey are seen in the Earth's [[homosphere]] (which includes the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], and [[mesosphere]]). Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the [[cloud physics]] branch of [[meteorology]].\n\nThe two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the atmosphere are Latin and common. Cloud types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have [[Latin]] names due to the universal adoption of [[Luke Howard]]'s [[nomenclature]]. Formally proposed in 1802, it became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical ''forms'' that appear in any or all of three altitude ''levels'' (formerly known as [[Etage|''\u00e9tages'']]). These physical types, in approximate ascending order of convective activity, include ''stratiform'' sheets, ''cirriform'' wisps and patches, ''stratocumuliform'' layers (mainly structured as rolls, ripples, and patches), ''cumuliform'' heaps, and very large ''cumulonimbiform'' heaps that often show complex structures. The physical forms are divided by altitude levels into 10 basic genus-types.\n\nThe Latin names for applicable ''high-level'' genera in the troposphere carry a ''cirro''- prefix, and an ''alto''- prefix is added to the names of the ''mid-level'' genus-types. Clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as ''low-'' or ''mid-level'' according to the altitude range at which each initially forms. However they are also more informally classified as ''multi-level'' or ''vertical'', which along with low level clouds, do not carry any altitude related prefixes. Most of the genera can be subdivided into ''species'' and further subdivided into ''varieties''. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names.\n\nSeveral cloud types that form higher up in the stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types, which may have the appearance of stratiform sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other [[planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the [[Solar System]] and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[sulfuric acid]], as well as water.\n\nThe tabular overview that follows is very broad in scope. It draws from several methods of cloud classification, both formal and informal, used in different levels of the Earth's homosphere by a number of cited authorities. Despite some differences in methodologies and terminologies, the classification schemes seen in this article can be harmonized by using an informal cross-classification of physical forms and altitude levels to derive the 10 tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure which can affect both forms and levels. This table should not be seen as a strict or singular classification, but as an illustration of how various major cloud types are related to each other and defined through a full range of altitude levels from Earth's surface to the \"edge of space\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Forms and levels !!

Around the beginning of the 13th century, the word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds, because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud. Over time, the metaphoric usage of the word supplanted the Old English ''weolcan'', which had been the literal term for clouds in general.<ref name=Harper>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cloud |title=Cloud |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2012 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cloud |title=Cloud |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n\nAncient cloud studies were not made in isolation, but were observed in combination with other [[weather]] elements and even other natural sciences. Around 340 BC, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word ''meteoros'', meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word came the modern term [[meteorology]], the study of clouds and weather. ''Meteorologica'' was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way, especially the [[hydrological cycle]].<ref name=\"Meteorologica\">{{cite journal |last=Frisinger |first=H.

Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language, and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting. Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of [[France]] because it used unusual French names for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds, and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803.<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=International Cloud Atlas, preface to the 1939 edition |volume=I |year=1975 |url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ IX\u2013XIII] |isbn=978-92-63-10407-6 |accessdate=6 December 2014 }}</ref> As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, German dramatist and poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard.

The variety ''undulatus'' (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus.

''Virga'' is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.<ref name=\"features\"/>\n\nWhen the precipitation reaches the ground without completely evaporating, it is designated as the feature ''praecipitatio''.<ref name=\"Dunlop77-78\">{{harvnb|Dunlop|2003|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, ''upward-growing'' cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while ''downward growing'' nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, has the capacity to produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.<ref name=\"clouds - species and varieties\"/><ref name=\"Aerographer2012\"/><ref name=\"features\"/>\n\n====Cloud-based supplementary features====\n''Incus'' is the most type-specific supplementary feature, seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus.

The supplementary feature ''cavum'' is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A ''murus'' feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A ''cauda'' feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.<ref name=ICA2017/>\n\n====Accessory clouds====\nSupplementary cloud formations detached from the main cloud are known as [[accessory cloud]]s.<ref name=\"clouds - species and varieties\"/><ref name=\"Aerographer2012\"/><ref name=\"features\"/> The heavier precipitating clouds, nimbostratus, towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the ''pannus'' feature, low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.<ref name=\"pannus\"/>\n\nA group of accessory clouds comprise formations that are associated mainly with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection.

It is formed by the warm, humid [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or [[scud (cloud)|scud]] clouds and does not rotate.<ref name=ICA2017/>\n\n==== Mother clouds ====\n[[File:Port of Piraeus Panoramic View.JPG|left|thumb|Cumulus partly spreading into stratocumulus cumulogenitus over the port of [[Piraeus]] in Greece ]]\n\nClouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a ''mother cloud''. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus, it is termed a ''genitus'' cloud. One example of this is ''stratocumulus cumulogenitus'', a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it is considered to be a ''mutatus'' cloud.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Mother clouds, International Cloud Atlas|year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/principles-of-cloud-classification-mother-clouds.html|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Sunset and Clouds.jpg|thumb|Cumulonimbus mother cloud dissipating into stratocumulus cumulonimbogenitus at dusk]]\n\n====Other genitus and mutatus clouds====\n\nThe genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term ''flammagenitus'' (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level \"pyrocumulus\" or \"fumulus\" clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus ''homogenitus'' (Latin for 'man-made'). [[Contrail]]s formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling cirrus which are designated cirrus ''homogenitus''.  If a cirrus homogenitus cloud changes fully to any of the high-level genera, they are termed cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus ''homomutatus''. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. ''Silvagenitus'' (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest canopy.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\"/>\n\n==== Stratocumulus fields ====\nStratocumulus clouds can be organized into \"fields\" that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics. In general, these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level.

As a result, the [[cloud base]] can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much [[light]] is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance. However, a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity.<ref name=\"Luminance\"/>\n\nAs a tropospheric cloud matures, the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as [[rain]]. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]/[[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.<ref name=\"Bette Hileman\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v073n007.p033| title = Clouds absorb more solar radiation than researchers previously thought| journal = Chemical & Engineering News| volume = 73| issue = 7| pages = 33| year = 1995| last1 = Hileman | first1 = B. }}</ref>\n\nStriking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude, with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident light.<ref name=\"Coloration\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Coloration, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/appearance-of-clouds-colour.html |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> During daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky, tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath. Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their [[Natural environment|environment]] or background. Red, orange, and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise/sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. When the sun is just below the horizon, low-level clouds are gray, middle clouds appear rose-colored, and high clouds are white or off-white. Clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky, or whitish when illuminated by the moon. They may also reflect the colors of large fires, city lights, or auroras that might be present.<ref name=\"Coloration\"/>\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color. A green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively low in the sky and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud. Supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this. In addition, the stronger the updraft is, the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds.<ref name=\"Curiosities\">{{cite web |editor=University of Wisconsen-Madison-News |title= Curiosities-Green sky before tornado |year=2007 |url= http://www.news.wisc.edu/14039|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nYellowish clouds may be seen in the troposphere in the late spring through early fall months during [[Wildfire|forest fire]] season.

First and foremost, they are the source of precipitation, thereby greatly influencing the distribution and amount of precipitation. Because of their differential buoyancy relative to surrounding cloud-free air, clouds can be associated with vertical motions of the air that may be convective, frontal, or cyclonic. The motion is upward if the clouds are less dense because condensation of water vapor releases heat, warming the air and thereby decreasing its density. This can lead to downward motion because lifting of the air results in cooling that increases its density. All of these effects are subtly dependent on the vertical temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere and result in major redistribution of heat that affect the Earth's climate.<ref name=\"cloud-heating\"/>\n\nThe complexity and diversity of clouds in the troposphere is a major reason for difficulty in quantifying the effects of clouds on climate and climate change. On the one hand, white cloud tops promote cooling of Earth's surface by reflecting shortwave radiation (visible and near infrared) from the sun, diminishing the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed at the surface, enhancing the Earth's [[albedo]]. Most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed, warming the surface, which emits radiation upward at longer, infrared, wavelengths. At these wavelengths, however, water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber. The water reacts by radiating, also in the infrared, both upward and downward, and the downward longwave radiation results in increased warming at the surface. This is analogous to the [[greenhouse effect]] of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[water vapor]].<ref name=\"cloud-heating\">{{cite web|url=http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/role.html|title=Cloud Climatology|website=International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHigh-level genus-types particularly show this duality with both short-wave [[albedo]] cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects. On the whole, ''ice-crystal'' clouds in the upper troposphere (cirrus) tend to favor net warming.<ref name=\"Clouds and the greenhouse effect\"/><ref name=\"Nucleation\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2002.1141|pmid=12662454| title = Nucleation of ice and its management in ecosystems| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume = 361| issue = 1804| pages = 557\u201374 | year = 2003| last1 = Franks | first1 = F.|bibcode=2003RSPTA.361..557F}}</ref> However, the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level and low clouds, especially when they form in extensive sheets.<ref name=\"Clouds and the greenhouse effect\"/> Measurements by NASA indicate that on the whole, the effects of low and mid-level clouds that tend to promote cooling outweigh the warming effects of high layers and the variable outcomes associated with vertically developed clouds.<ref name=\"Clouds and the greenhouse effect\">[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 124</ref>\n\nAs difficult as it is to evaluate the influences of current clouds on current climate, it is even more problematic to predict changes in cloud patterns and properties in a future, warmer climate, and the resultant cloud influences on future climate. In a warmer climate more water would enter the atmosphere by evaporation at the surface; as clouds are formed from water vapor, cloudiness would be expected to increase. But in a warmer climate, higher temperatures would tend to evaporate clouds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/|title=A World Without Clouds|first=Natalie|last=Wolchover|website=Quanta Magazine}}</ref> Both of these statements are considered accurate, and both phenomena, known as cloud feedbacks, are found in climate model calculations. Broadly speaking, if clouds, especially low clouds, increase in a warmer climate, the resultant cooling effect leads to a negative feedback in climate response to increased greenhouse gases. But if low clouds decrease, or if high clouds increase, the feedback is positive. Differing amounts of these feedbacks are the principal reason for differences in [[Climate sensitivity|climate sensitivities]] of current global climate models. As a consequence, much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate. Leading global models produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005GL023851| title = Marine boundary layer clouds at the heart of tropical cloud feedback uncertainties in climate models| journal = Geophysical Research Letters| volume = 32| issue = 20| pages = L20806| year = 2005| last1 = Bony | first1 = S. |bibcode = 2005GeoRL..3220806B }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/2008JCLI1995.1| title = Aquaplanets, Climate Sensitivity, and Low Clouds| journal = Journal of Climate| volume = 21| issue = 19| pages = 4974\u20134991| year = 2008| last1 = Medeiros | first1 = B. | last2 = Stevens | first2 = B. | last3 = Held | first3 = I.

{"title_page": "Hong Shin-seon", "text_new": "{{short description|South Korean poet}}\n'''Hong Shin-seon''' (1944\u2013present) is a Korean poet. His writing career dates back to the 1960s, when he was active as a modernist poet. During the 1970\u201380s, his poetry engaged critically with the politics of the time. From the 1990s, Hong\u2019s focus shifted to Buddhist thought, and the serial poem ''Maeumgyung'' (\ub9c8\uc74c\uacbd The Book of the Mind), which was written over a period over twenty years, is considered his major work.\n\n== Life ==\nHong was born in 1944 in Hwaseong, Gyunggi Province. From a young age he studied Chinese literary classics under the guidance of his great-uncle, and grew up reading classical texts such as ''Samgukji\u00a0'' (\uc0bc\uad6d\uc9c0 Records of the Three Kingdoms).<ref>[https://www.aladin.co.kr/author/wauthor_overview.aspx?AuthorSearch=@52211 Author profile on aladin.co.kr].</ref> As a middle-school student, he read Kim Naesung\u2019s popular detective story ''Main'' (\ub9c8\uc778 Fiend) and began to dream of becoming a novelist. Throughout his years at high school he read the literary journals ''Jayumunhak'' and ''Hakwon'' and wrote his own stories. Hong has spoken about how this period improved and influenced his writing by building up his vocabulary and training him in descriptive technique. \n\nOnce at university, Hong\u2019s interest shifted from prose fiction to poetry. After three years of writing and honing his craft, he officially debuted as a poet while in his senior year when his poem \u201cThe Greek\u2019s Pipe\u201d was selected for publication in the journal ''Shinmunhak'' in 1965. The poem was influenced by the Greek myths he had been reading throughout college. In 1968, Hong set up the literary coterie magazine ''Hanguksi'' with Oh Kyuwon and others. In 1970 he married one of his fellow coterie members, the poet Ro Hyang-Rim. In the 1980s he left Seoul and settled in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province. There his world expanded from the narrower confines of literary circles, and he came into closer contact with the diverse lives around him. This brought about a big shift in his poetry. In 2003 he founded the literary magazine ''Munhak Seon'' (or Zen, \uc120\u79aa), and remains its publisher and editor.<ref>\u201c[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon\u201d, ''Yeolinsihak'', March 2010 Issue.</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Writing ==\n\n==== People-oriented poetry ====\nAlthough he himself had engaged in numerous debates and discussions about literature and politics with fellow coterie members and writers since his debut in 1965, Hong Shin-seon recalls how after moving to Andong in the 1980s and coming into daily contact with ordinary lives, he came to realize the speciousness of the very reality or ideologies that he and his friends had so often talked about. Hong felt that the people he encountered in Andong were \u201ca key-hole, a password, and a symbol\u201d in that they would allow him to \u201cobserve contemporary life\u201d. ''Uri iut saramdeul'' (\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc774\uc6c3 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4 Our Neighbors, 1984), an earlier collection from this period, features people from broad walks of life, from tearoom servers and people in migrant communities to brokers.<ref>\u201c[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon\u201d, ''Yeolinsihak'', March 2010 Issue.</ref> Searching for the right form and way to depict the lives of people in an honest, truthful manner, Hong eventually came to turn to a sort of narrative poetry, or storied poetry.<ref>Yi Deokhun, [http://m.chosun.com/svc/article.html?sname=news&contid=2004030770264#wrap_id \u201cPutting one\u2019s soul into the writing of poetry is a process rife with adventure\u201d], ''Chosun Ilbo'', 2004.03.07.</ref> This collection marks Hong\u2019s transition from brooding critical and intellectual poet to a poet interested in the lives of his neighbors.<ref>Publisher\u2019s [http://moonji.com/book/4545/ book synopsis].</ref>\n\nThis is still very much apparent in his next collection, ''Dasi gohyangeseo'' (\ub2e4\uc2dc \uace0\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c Home Again, 1990), even if the backdrop is now the poet\u2019s own hometown of Hwaseong rather than Andong. The poems collected here are especially notable for their embodiment of giving voice and form to agricultural/farming communities that have been hollowed out by industrialization and the loss of traditional forms of life and teeter on the brink of ruin.<ref>\u201c[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon\u201d, ''Yeolinsihak'', March 2010 Issue.</ref> Hong\u2019s attention to marginalized or excluded \u2018neighbors\u2019 continue in ''Salmui ongi'' (\uc0b6\uc758 \uc639\uc774 Gnarl of Life, 2014).<ref>Cho Minseo, [http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2014052611154264549 \u201c''Salmui ongi'' asks unending questions about life and death\u201d], ''The Asia Business Daily'', 2014.05.26.</ref>\n\n==== ''Maeumgyung'' Series ====\nHong Shin-seon published the first installment of his serial poem \u201cMaeungyung\u201d in 1991 and the last installment, collected in ''Uyeoneul jeom jjikda'' (\uc6b0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc810 \ucc0d\ub2e4 Marking Out Coincidence), in 2009.<ref>Lee Gowoon, [https://www.hankyung.com/life/article/2009060828571 \u201cHong Shin-seon\u2019s new collection ''Uyeoneul jeom jjikda'' offers deep contemplations on life and death\u201d], ''The Korea Economic Daily'', 2009.06.08.</ref> This series of poems ponder life and death from the perspective of Buddhist thought. Hong says the impulse for this work came from the strong aversion he felt toward the general prevalence of poetry purporting to represent reality, as well as from the considerable shock he experienced at the demise of the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc, which prompted him to seek out work that was more reflective and that interrogated one\u2019s inner life.<ref>\u201c[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon\u201d, ''Yeolinsihak'', March 2010 Issue.</ref> As for his growing interest in Buddhism, he points to Kim Daljin\u2019s poetry and the Buddhist seon poems<ref>Seon poems refer to poetry that reflects Seon Buddhist thought (\uc120\uc0ac\uc0c1 \u79aa\u601d\u60f3) and the process by which one attains or strives for awakening.</ref> translated by Kim as a direct influence on him.<ref>Park Roksam, [https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20100526022006#csidx1533ae4900baa&#x20;&#x20;9cb95b7e18f3bc3a87 \u201cThe 21<sup>st</sup> Kim Daljin Literature Prize: 'I will eradicate rather than\u00a0 compromise my poetry'\u201d], ''Seoul Shinmun'', 2010.05.26.</ref> Hong\u2019s serial poem captures his own dawning realization that life can be viewed much more clearly when one confronts rather than turns away from the solitude and futility of existence.<ref>Baek Wonki, [http://www.buddhismjournal.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=5234 \u201cThe Poetics of Hong Shin-seon\u2019s ''Maeungyung''\u201d], ''Buddhism Journal'', 2011.10.15.</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Complete works ===\n''Hong Shin-seon Siseonjip'' (\ud64d\uc2e0\uc120 \uc2dc\uc804\uc9d1 The Complete Works of Hong Shin-seon), Sanmaek, 2004. \n\n''Hong Shin-seon Siseonjip 2.

His writing career dates back to the 1960s, when he was active as a modernist poet. During the 1970\u201380s, his poetry engaged critically with the politics of the time. From the 1990s, Hong\u2019s focus shifted to Buddhist thought, and the serial poem ''Maeumgyung'' (\ub9c8\uc74c\uacbd The Book of the Mind), which was written over a period over twenty years, is considered his major work.\n\n== Life ==\nHong was born in 1944 in Hwaseong, Gyunggi Province. From a young age he studied Chinese literary classics under the guidance of his great-uncle, and grew up reading classical texts such as ''Samgukji\u00a0'' (\uc0bc\uad6d\uc9c0 Records of the Three Kingdoms).<ref>[https://www.aladin.co.kr/author/wauthor_overview.aspx?AuthorSearch=@52211 Author profile on aladin.co.kr].</ref> As a middle-school student, he read Kim Naesung\u2019s popular detective story ''Main'' (\ub9c8\uc778 Fiend) and began to dream of becoming a novelist. Throughout his years at high school he read the literary journals ''Jayumunhak'' and ''Hakwon'' and wrote his own stories. Hong has spoken about how this period improved and influenced his writing by building up his vocabulary and training him in descriptive technique. \n\nOnce at university, Hong\u2019s interest shifted from prose fiction to poetry. After three years of writing and honing his craft, he officially debuted as a poet while in his senior year when his poem \u201cThe Greek\u2019s Pipe\u201d was selected for publication in the journal ''Shinmunhak'' in 1965. The poem was influenced by the Greek myths he had been reading throughout college. In 1968, Hong set up the literary coterie magazine ''Hanguksi'' with Oh Kyuwon and others. In 1970 he married one of his fellow coterie members, the poet Ro Hyang-Rim. In the 1980s he left Seoul and settled in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province. There his world expanded from the narrower confines of literary circles, and he came into closer contact with the diverse lives around him. This brought about a big shift in his poetry. In 2003 he founded the literary magazine ''Munhak Seon'' (or Zen, \uc120\u79aa), and remains its publisher and editor.<ref>\u201c[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon\u201d, ''Yeolinsihak'', March 2010 Issue.</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Writing ==\n\n==== People-oriented poetry ====\nAlthough he himself had engaged in numerous debates and discussions about literature and politics with fellow coterie members and writers since his debut in 1965, Hong Shin-seon recalls how after moving to Andong in the 1980s and coming into daily contact with ordinary lives, he came to realize the speciousness of the very reality or ideologies that he and his friends had so often talked about. Hong felt that the people he encountered in Andong were \u201ca key-hole, a password, and a symbol\u201d in that they would allow him to \u201cobserve contemporary life\u201d. ''Uri iut saramdeul'' (\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc774\uc6c3 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4 Our Neighbors, 1984), an earlier collection from this period, features people from broad walks of life, from tearoom servers and people in migrant communities to brokers.<ref>\u201c[Special Feature] In Search of the Poet Hong Shin-seon\u201d, ''Yeolinsihak'', March 2010 Issue.</ref> Searching for the right form and way to depict the lives of people in an honest, truthful manner, Hong eventually came to turn to a sort of narrative poetry, or storied poetry.<ref>Yi Deokhun, [http://m.chosun.com/svc/article.html?sname=news&contid=2004030770264#wrap_id \u201cPutting one\u2019s soul into the writing of poetry is a process rife with adventure\u201d], ''Chosun Ilbo'', 2004.03.07.</ref> This collection marks Hong\u2019s transition from brooding critical and intellectual poet to a poet interested in the lives of his neighbors.<ref>Publisher\u2019s [http://moonji.com/book/4545/ book synopsis].</ref>\n\nThis is still very much apparent in his next collection, ''Dasi gohyangeseo'' (\ub2e4\uc2dc \uace0\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c Home Again, 1990), even if the backdrop is now the poet\u2019s own hometown of Hwaseong rather than Andong.

Pupils are prepared for the ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' ({{IPA-fr|bakal\u0254\u0281e\u02c8a|}}) (baccalaureate, colloquially known as ''le bac''), which can lead to higher education studies or directly to professional life. There are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'': the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'', and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel''.\n\n==School year==\n\nThe school year starts in early September and ends in early July. Metropolitan [[French school holidays]] are scheduled by the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]] by dividing the country into three zones (A, B, and C) to prevent overcrowding by family holidaymakers of [[tourist]] destinations, such as the [[Mediterranean]] coast and ski resorts. [[Lyon]], for example, is in zone A, [[Marseille]] is in zone B and [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]] are in zone C.\n\nIn contrast to the practice in most other education systems, the school years in France are numbered on a decreasing scale. Thus, pupils begin their secondary education in the ''sixi\u00e8me'' (6th class) and transfer to a ''lyc\u00e9e'' in the ''seconde'' (2nd class). The final year is the ''terminale''.\n\nIn French, the word ''\u00e9tudiant(e)'' is usually reserved for [[university]]-level students, and ''coll\u00e8ge'' and ''lyc\u00e9e'' students are referred to as ''\u00e9l\u00e8ves'' (''pupils'' or ''students'' in English).\n\nThe curriculum (''le programme officiel'') is standardized for all French public institutions. Changes to the programme are made every year by the French Ministry of Education and are published in the Ministry's ''Bulletin Officiel de l'\u00c9ducation Nationale'' (''BO''), the official reference bulletin for educators.\n\n==Coll\u00e8ge==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=300\n|- \n| colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=orange| '''''Coll\u00e8ge'''''\n|- \n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Along with 3-4 weekly hours of [[physical education]], a typical school week consists of some 26 hours of schooling. [[French language]] and [[French language|literature]] occupy the most time, 4-5 hours per week, followed by 4 hours per week of [[mathematics]]; other subjects occupy 1-3.5 hours per week.\n\nThe curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French Ministry of National Education]] and applies to all ''coll\u00e8ges'' in France and also for [[Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger|AEFE-dependent]] institutions. ''Acad\u00e9mies'' and individual schools have little margin for curriculum customisation. Teachers compose [[Syllabus|syllabi]] per precise government educational regulations and choose [[textbook]]s accordingly, and every major French publishing house has a textbook branch.\n\n=== Process and purpose ===\nUsually a different \"professeur\" or teacher teaches each subject; most teachers teach several different age groups. ''Coll\u00e8ge'' pupils stay in the same class throughout the school year and in every subject (except for optional courses such as foreign languages, where students from several classes mix), so each year-group is divided into as many classes as necessary. The strong belief in teaching in mixed-ability classes means that [[Tracking (education)| streaming]] occurs only rarely.\n\nClass sizes vary from school to school, but usually range from 20 to 35 pupils. Each class has a ''professeur principal'' (main teacher or class tutor) who acts as the link between the teaching staff, administration and pupils.<ref>{{cite book|title= The French Education System|author= H. D. Lewis|pages= 58|year= 1985|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-7099-1683-3}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the ''coll\u00e8ge'' has the task of preparing students for the advanced subjects of the ''lyc\u00e9e''. At the end of the ''troisi\u00e8me'' class, students sit for [[National diploma (France) | ''le dipl\u00f4me national du brevet'']], an end-of-''coll\u00e8ge'' [[Test (assessment)| examination]]. The ''brevet'' is not required for entrance to the ''lyc\u00e9e'', and passing it does not guarantee that a pupil will progress to the higher-level school.\n\nDuring the last ''conseil de classe'' of the year, held in June, teachers and administrators decide whether or not a pupil can progress to the next grade. In deciding, they evaluate the student's [[skills]], participation, and [[behaviour]]. One of three outcomes is possible:\n \n# The student progresses to the next grade.\n# His or her ''redoublement'' (repeating the year) can be required.\n# He or she can, in specific cases, be offered to skip a grade and be promoted two grades.\n \nA student asked to repeat a grade can [[appeal]] said decision. The decision of the appeals council is final.\n\n== Lyc\u00e9e ==\n\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e'' is the second, and last, stage of [[secondary education]] in the [[French educational system]]. The City of Paris refers to a lyc\u00e9e in English as a \"[[sixth form college]]\".<ref name=\"Parisschools\"/> A pupil attending a lyc\u00e9e is a ''lyc\u00e9en'' (masculine) or a ''lyc\u00e9enne'' (feminine).\n\nUntil 1959, the term lyc\u00e9e designated a secondary school with a full curriculum (7 years, the present college + lyc\u00e9e) directly under the supervision of the State, then from 1959 to 1963 any secondary school with a full curriculum.<ref>Jean-Michel Chapoulie.

There are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' and which are completely different: the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate).\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=300\n|- \n| colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=orange| '''''Lyc\u00e9e'''''\n|- \n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

General and technological education courses are provided in \"standard\" ''lyc\u00e9es'', while vocational courses are provided in separate professional ''lyc\u00e9es''.\n\nIn practice, competent pupils at a vocational ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' can also apply to take short-term, post\u2013baccalaur\u00e9at studies leading to the ''Brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur'' (BTS), a vocational qualification. That option is available also to pupils at a ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and lyc\u00e9e technologique===\n====General streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'')====\nIn France, the ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' is the usual stepping stone to [[university]] degrees. \n\nBefore 2021, the students of the general baccalaureate choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in the penultimate ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). During the ''seconde'', students mostly take the same courses, despite having different academic skills and interests, so it is usually thought to be an easier year than either the ''premi\u00e8re'' or the ''terminale''.\n\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' examination is different for all three ''s\u00e9ries'', and subjects are weighted according to the course taken.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Streams'''||'''S'''<br /> ''scientifique''<br /> (sciences) ||'''ES'''<br />''\u00e9conomique et social''<br /> (economics and social sciences) ||'''L'''<br />''litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (literature)\n|-\n|'''Description'''|| The science stream (''bac S - bac scientifique'') requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[biology]] & [[geology]] and, if available, [[Engineering|engineering sciences]] and [[computer science]]. || The ''bac ES'' (''bac \u00e9conomique et social'') requires a high level in [[economics]] and [[Social science|social]] courses of studies; also in [[mathematics]], [[history]] & [[geography]]. || The ''bac L'' (''bac litt\u00e9raire'') weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[Foreign language|foreign languages]] and [[The arts|arts]] heavily. Students in ''premi\u00e8re litt\u00e9raire'' (1\u00e8reL or 1L) have no maths and only a small amount of sciences unless they choose the 'maths' option. Students in ''Terminale Litt\u00e9raire'' (TleL or TL) have no maths, physics and chemistry or biology unless they chose the 'maths' option in 1L.\n|}\n\nAccording to the official statistics, for the 2003\u20132004 school year, 33 per cent of all students chose ''s\u00e9rie S''; 19 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie ES''; and 11 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie L''.<ref>[ftp://trf.education.gouv.fr/pub/edutel/dpd/rers2004/chap4_12.pdf official statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAll students take [[philosophy]] courses in ''terminale'', while [[French language]] classes end in the ''premi\u00e8re'', excepting the ''s\u00e9rie L'', where they become [[French literature]] classes, where pupils are to study two books during the year, from French writers, or foreign books translated into French (e.g. ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' during the school year 2007\u20132008, or ''[[The Leopard]]'' from Italian author [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]).\n\nThere also is a required option for further specialisation in all ''s\u00e9ries'', although it is restricted to the chosen course. For example, a student in ''s\u00e9rie S'' can choose to specialise in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], \"[[:fr:Sciences de la vie et de la terre|''SVT'']]{{-\"}} ([[biology]] and [[geology]]) or \"[[engineering]] sciences\" but not in [[philosophy]].\n\nA student in ''s\u00e9rie L'' can choose to specialise in one of his or her foreign languages (English being the most popular), a third foreign language or a dead language such as Latin, or one of the following arts: music, theatre, circus, \"plastiques\". Specialisation adds a separate, weekly two-hour class in the chosen discipline; also, it increases the weight of the chosen subject at the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. The [[syllabus]] in the specialisation class is unrelated to the material learned in the common class. Specialisation plays no role in the choice of a post\u2013secondary career or subject at [[university]], except for a few courses aimed for students from a given ''s\u00e9rie'' that can also accept students from other ''s\u00e9ries'' if they have taken a given specialisation.\n\nIn 2021, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. On this date, students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties : [[The arts|arts]], [[ecology]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[humanities]], [[Language|languages]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[Economics|economic]] and [[Social science|social sciences]], [[Engineering|engineering sciences]], [[biology]] & [[geology]]. These specialties are added to a part common to all : [[French language|french]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[Language|languages]], [[Science|sciences]], [[sport]]. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final [[Oral tradition|oral]] test.\n\n==== Technical streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'') ====\nAfter the ''seconde'', students can also go on the ''lyc\u00e9e technologique'' to obtain the ''baccalaureat technologique.'' It includes eight other streams, called ''s\u00e9ries technologiques'':\n\n* ''sciences et technologies de la gestion'' (Management Sciences and Technologies, ''STG'') (replaced ''sciences et technologies tertiaires'' (Service Sciences and Technologies, ''STT'') for the June 2007 Bac Exam)\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'industrie et du d\u00e9veloppement durable'' (Industrial Science and Technologies and sustainable development, ''STI2D'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de laboratoire'' (Laboratory Science and Technologies, ''STL'')\n* ''sciences m\u00e9dico-sociales'' (Health and Social Sciences, ''SMS''): The name was changed in 2007 and became: ''Sciences et technologies de la sant\u00e9 et du social'' (Sciences and Technologies in Health and Social, ''ST2S'')\n* ''sciences et technologies du produit agroalimentaire'' (Food Science and Technologies, ''STPA'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'agronomie et de l'environnement'' (Agronomy and Environment Science and Technologies, ''STAE'')\n* ''techniques de la musique et de la danse'' (Music and Dance Techniques, ''TMD'')\n* ''h\u00f4tellerie'' (Hotel and restaurants management)\n\nThe STPA and STAE stream are available only in ''lyc\u00e9es agricoles'', speciality schools for [[agricultural sciences]].\n\nThe teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e professionnel===\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' leads to the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel''. The courses are designed for students who do not plan to continue into higher education. The vocational training is for craftspeople and involves internships in commercial enterprises. The courses are suitable for students who are more interested in a hands-on educational approach than in academic schooling. There are nearly 100 specialties like : Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooked; Road freight transport driver; Butcher etc.\n\n== Carte scolaire ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Lycee Rennes DSC08932.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A lyc\u00e9e in [[Rennes]], from the 19th century.]]\nFrench parents are not free to choose the state school that their children will attend; unless the children have special learning needs, they will attend the school allocated to them by the ''carte scolaire'' (school map). Reasons for attending a state school that is not their nearest include studying an option unavailable in the school to which they were originally assigned (e.g. a rare foreign language).\n\nFor many reasons, many parents consider the allocated school inadequate, particularly if they do not like the idea of their children mixing with some of the other pupils at the school. That is especially the case in poor neighbourhoods with large foreign [[immigrant]] populations. In any city, there are \"better\" lyc\u00e9es and coll\u00e8ges, which parents would prefer their children attend (usually dating from the 19th century, in the city centre). The two main methods used in such circumstances to get children into a school other than their assigned school are:\n\n* paying for partly subsidised private schooling;\n* having the child choose an unusual option (e.g. Ancient Greek) available only in the preferred school.\n\nA similar trick is used if some classes in a school are seen as \"better\" than others. For organisational reasons, students taking certain options are grouped into special classes, which may be academically attractive. They typically include classes taking German as a first foreign language, or Latin or Ancient Greek as options.\n\n==Outside France==\n{{main article|Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|Education}}\n* [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]]\n* [[Grandes \u00e9coles]]\n* [[Education in France]]\n* [[Agency for French Education Abroad]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/index.php French Ministry of Education (in French)]\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/default.htm ''Bulletin Officiel'' (in French)]\n* [http://www.cndp.fr/secondaire/ ''Centre national de documentation p\u00e9dagogique'' website (in French)]\n* [http://about-france.com/primary-secondary-schools.htm The school system and education in France (in English)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secondary Education In France}}\n[[Category:Education in France]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in France| ]]\n[[Category:Secondary education by country|France]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A level of French education}}\n{{Redirect|Lyc\u00e9e}}\n{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Vesoul Lyc\u00e9e des Haberges.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Lyc\u00e9e in [[Vesoul]]]]\n\nIn [[France]], '''secondary education ''' is in two stages:\n\n* '''''Coll\u00e8ges''''' ({{IPA-fr|k\u0254\u02c8l\u025b\u0292}}) cater for the first four years of [[secondary education]] from the ages of 11 to 15.\n* '''''Lyc\u00e9es''''' ({{IPA-fr|li\u02c8se|}}) provide a three-year course of further secondary education for children between the ages of 15 and 18.

There is no entrance [[Test (assessment)|examination]] into ''coll\u00e8ge'', but administrators have established a comprehensive academic examination of students starting in ''sixi\u00e8me''. The purpose of the examination is evaluating pupils' level on being graduated from primary school. \n{{clear}}\n\n===Curriculum===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=450\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Along with 3-4 weekly hours of [[physical education]], a typical school week consists of some 26 hours of schooling. [[French language]] and [[French language|literature]] occupy the most time, 4-5 hours per week, followed by 4 hours per week of [[mathematics]]; other subjects occupy 1-3.5 hours per week.\n\nThe curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French Ministry of National Education]] and applies to all ''coll\u00e8ges'' in France and also for [[Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger|AEFE-dependent]] institutions. ''Acad\u00e9mies'' and individual schools have little margin for curriculum customisation. Teachers compose [[Syllabus|syllabi]] per precise government educational regulations and choose [[textbook]]s accordingly, and every major French publishing house has a textbook branch.\n\n=== Process and purpose ===\nUsually a different \"professeur\" or teacher teaches each subject; most teachers teach several different age groups. ''Coll\u00e8ge'' pupils stay in the same class throughout the school year and in every subject (except for optional courses such as foreign languages, where students from several classes mix), so each year-group is divided into as many classes as necessary. The strong belief in teaching in mixed-ability classes means that [[Tracking (education)| streaming]] occurs only rarely.\n\nClass sizes vary from school to school, but usually range from 20 to 35 pupils. Each class has a ''professeur principal'' (main teacher or class tutor) who acts as the link between the teaching staff, administration and pupils.<ref>{{cite book|title= The French Education System|author= H. D. Lewis|pages= 58|year= 1985|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-7099-1683-3}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the ''coll\u00e8ge'' has the task of preparing students for the advanced subjects of the ''lyc\u00e9e''. At the end of the ''troisi\u00e8me'' class, students sit for [[National diploma (France) | ''le dipl\u00f4me national du brevet'']], an end-of-''coll\u00e8ge'' [[Test (assessment)| examination]]. The ''brevet'' is not required for entrance to the ''lyc\u00e9e'', and passing it does not guarantee that a pupil will progress to the higher-level school.\n\nDuring the last ''conseil de classe'' of the year, held in June, teachers and administrators decide whether or not a pupil can progress to the next grade. In deciding, they evaluate the student's [[skills]], participation, and [[behaviour]]. One of three outcomes is possible:\n \n# The student progresses to the next grade.\n# His or her ''redoublement'' (repeating the year) can be required.\n# He or she can, in specific cases, be offered to skip a grade and be promoted two grades.\n \nA student asked to repeat a grade can [[appeal]] said decision. The decision of the appeals council is final.\n\n== Lyc\u00e9e ==\n\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e'' is the second, and last, stage of [[secondary education]] in the [[French educational system]]. The City of Paris refers to a lyc\u00e9e in English as a \"[[sixth form college]]\".<ref name=\"Parisschools\"/> A pupil attending a lyc\u00e9e is a ''lyc\u00e9en'' (masculine) or a ''lyc\u00e9enne'' (feminine).\n\nUntil 1959, the term lyc\u00e9e designated a secondary school with a full curriculum (7 years, the present college + lyc\u00e9e) directly under the supervision of the State, then from 1959 to 1963 any secondary school with a full curriculum.<ref>Jean-Michel Chapoulie.

There are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' and which are completely different: the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate).\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=300\n|- \n| colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=orange| '''''Lyc\u00e9e'''''\n|- \n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

General and technological education courses are provided in \"standard\" ''lyc\u00e9es'', while vocational courses are provided in separate professional ''lyc\u00e9es''.\n\nIn practice, competent pupils at a vocational ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' can also apply to take short-term, post\u2013baccalaur\u00e9at studies leading to the ''Brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur'' (BTS), a vocational qualification. That option is available also to pupils at a ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and lyc\u00e9e technologique===\n====General streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'')====\nIn France, the ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' is the usual stepping stone to [[university]] degrees. \n\nBefore 2021, the students of the general baccalaureate choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in the penultimate ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). During the ''seconde'', students mostly take the same courses, despite having different academic skills and interests, so it is usually thought to be an easier year than either the ''premi\u00e8re'' or the ''terminale''.\n\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' examination is different for all three ''s\u00e9ries'', and subjects are weighted according to the course taken.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Streams'''||'''S'''<br /> ''scientifique''<br /> (sciences) ||'''ES'''<br />''\u00e9conomique et social''<br /> (economics and social sciences) ||'''L'''<br />''litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (literature)\n|-\n|'''Description'''|| The science stream (''bac S - bac scientifique'') requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[biology]] & [[geology]] and, if available, [[Engineering|engineering sciences]] and [[computer science]]. || The ''bac ES'' (''bac \u00e9conomique et social'') requires a high level in [[economics]] and [[Social science|social]] courses of studies; also in [[mathematics]], [[history]] & [[geography]]. || The ''bac L'' (''bac litt\u00e9raire'') weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[Foreign language|foreign languages]] and [[The arts|arts]] heavily. Students in ''premi\u00e8re litt\u00e9raire'' (1\u00e8reL or 1L) have no maths and only a small amount of sciences unless they choose the 'maths' option. Students in ''Terminale Litt\u00e9raire'' (TleL or TL) have no maths, physics and chemistry or biology unless they chose the 'maths' option in 1L.\n|}\n\nAccording to the official statistics, for the 2003\u20132004 school year, 33 per cent of all students chose ''s\u00e9rie S''; 19 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie ES''; and 11 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie L''.<ref>[ftp://trf.education.gouv.fr/pub/edutel/dpd/rers2004/chap4_12.pdf official statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAll students take [[philosophy]] courses in ''terminale'', while [[French language]] classes end in the ''premi\u00e8re'', excepting the ''s\u00e9rie L'', where they become [[French literature]] classes, where pupils are to study two books during the year, from French writers, or foreign books translated into French (e.g. ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' during the school year 2007\u20132008, or ''[[The Leopard]]'' from Italian author [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]).\n\nThere also is a required option for further specialisation in all ''s\u00e9ries'', although it is restricted to the chosen course. For example, a student in ''s\u00e9rie S'' can choose to specialise in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], \"[[:fr:Sciences de la vie et de la terre|''SVT'']]{{-\"}} ([[biology]] and [[geology]]) or \"[[engineering]] sciences\" but not in [[philosophy]].\n\nA student in ''s\u00e9rie L'' can choose to specialise in one of his or her foreign languages (English being the most popular), a third foreign language or a dead language such as Latin, or one of the following arts: music, theatre, circus, \"plastiques\". Specialisation adds a separate, weekly two-hour class in the chosen discipline; also, it increases the weight of the chosen subject at the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. The [[syllabus]] in the specialisation class is unrelated to the material learned in the common class. Specialisation plays no role in the choice of a post\u2013secondary career or subject at [[university]], except for a few courses aimed for students from a given ''s\u00e9rie'' that can also accept students from other ''s\u00e9ries'' if they have taken a given specialisation.\n\nIn 2021, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. On this date, students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties : [[The arts|arts]], [[ecology]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[humanities]], [[Language|languages]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[Economics|economic]] and [[Social science|social sciences]], [[Engineering|engineering sciences]], [[biology]] & [[geology]]. These specialties are added to a part common to all : [[French language|french]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[Language|languages]], [[Science|sciences]], [[sport]]. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final [[Oral tradition|oral]] test.\n\n==== Technical streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'') ====\nAfter the ''seconde'', students can also go on the ''lyc\u00e9e technologique'' to obtain the ''baccalaureat technologique.'' It includes eight other streams, called ''s\u00e9ries technologiques'':\n\n* ''sciences et technologies de la gestion'' (Management Sciences and Technologies, ''STG'') (replaced ''sciences et technologies tertiaires'' (Service Sciences and Technologies, ''STT'') for the June 2007 Bac Exam)\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'industrie et du d\u00e9veloppement durable'' (Industrial Science and Technologies and sustainable development, ''STI2D'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de laboratoire'' (Laboratory Science and Technologies, ''STL'')\n* ''sciences m\u00e9dico-sociales'' (Health and Social Sciences, ''SMS''): The name was changed in 2007 and became: ''Sciences et technologies de la sant\u00e9 et du social'' (Sciences and Technologies in Health and Social, ''ST2S'')\n* ''sciences et technologies du produit agroalimentaire'' (Food Science and Technologies, ''STPA'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'agronomie et de l'environnement'' (Agronomy and Environment Science and Technologies, ''STAE'')\n* ''techniques de la musique et de la danse'' (Music and Dance Techniques, ''TMD'')\n* ''h\u00f4tellerie'' (Hotel and restaurants management)\n\nThe STPA and STAE stream are available only in ''lyc\u00e9es agricoles'', speciality schools for [[agricultural sciences]].\n\nThe teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e professionnel===\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' leads to the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel''. The courses are designed for students who do not plan to continue into higher education. The vocational training is for craftspeople and involves internships in commercial enterprises. The courses are suitable for students who are more interested in a hands-on educational approach than in academic schooling. There are nearly 100 specialties like : Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooked; Road freight transport driver; Butcher etc.\n\n== Carte scolaire ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Lycee Rennes DSC08932.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A lyc\u00e9e in [[Rennes]], from the 19th century.]]\nFrench parents are not free to choose the state school that their children will attend; unless the children have special learning needs, they will attend the school allocated to them by the ''carte scolaire'' (school map). Reasons for attending a state school that is not their nearest include studying an option unavailable in the school to which they were originally assigned (e.g. a rare foreign language).\n\nFor many reasons, many parents consider the allocated school inadequate, particularly if they do not like the idea of their children mixing with some of the other pupils at the school. That is especially the case in poor neighbourhoods with large foreign [[immigrant]] populations. In any city, there are \"better\" lyc\u00e9es and coll\u00e8ges, which parents would prefer their children attend (usually dating from the 19th century, in the city centre). The two main methods used in such circumstances to get children into a school other than their assigned school are:\n\n* paying for partly subsidised private schooling;\n* having the child choose an unusual option (e.g. Ancient Greek) available only in the preferred school.\n\nA similar trick is used if some classes in a school are seen as \"better\" than others. For organisational reasons, students taking certain options are grouped into special classes, which may be academically attractive. They typically include classes taking German as a first foreign language, or Latin or Ancient Greek as options.\n\n==Outside France==\n{{main article|Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|Education}}\n* [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]]\n* [[Grandes \u00e9coles]]\n* [[Education in France]]\n* [[Agency for French Education Abroad]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/index.php French Ministry of Education (in French)]\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/default.htm ''Bulletin Officiel'' (in French)]\n* [http://www.cndp.fr/secondaire/ ''Centre national de documentation p\u00e9dagogique'' website (in French)]\n* [http://about-france.com/primary-secondary-schools.htm The school system and education in France (in English)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secondary Education In France}}\n[[Category:Education in France]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in France| ]]\n[[Category:Secondary education by country|France]]\n", "name_user": "Largoplazo", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education_in_France"}

Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the [[risk-benefit ratio]] is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:\n\n:* People with a history of moderate or severe depression\n:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period\n:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions\n:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.\n\nThe guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of [[relapse]], and that [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] are better tolerated than [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=December 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archivedate=15 November 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference.
