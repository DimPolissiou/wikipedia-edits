Er maj grandeh de tol mundo erah un uen presidenteh.\n\nFranco was born in [[Ferrol, Spain]] as the son of an upper-class family with strong traditional ties and several generations of high-ranking officers in the [[Spanish Navy]]. But due to the navy being crippled by the [[Spanish-American War]] Franco instead joined the [[Spanish Army]] as a cadet in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]] in 1907, graduating in 1910. He would then go on to serve in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics. In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33, the youngest General in all Europe,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918\u20131926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018</ref> and two years later he became director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} \n\nAs a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and a [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]]. For a time he was even left without posting, but his career improved after the right-wing [[Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]]. In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|uprising]] in [[Asturias]], sharpening the antagonism between [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the country. In 1935 he became [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]], but when the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] Franco was once again marginalized, being relieved of his position and relegated to the [[Canary Islands]]. When [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]], leader of the opposition, was murdered that summer it triggered [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which had been plotted since the election in February. Franco had initially kept his distance from the plot, but joined in the last minute with complete resolution. The coup failed and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. \n\nFranco took control of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], which was air-lifted to Spain. With the death of the other leading generals, Franco became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader and was appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936\u20131975)|Head of State]] in the autumn of 1936. By a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] in 1937 Franco merged all [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist parties]] into a [[one-party state|single party]], the [[FET y de las JONS]]. In 1939 the Nationalists had won the war, which had claimed almost half a million lives. The victory extended [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] over all of Spain, and it was followed by a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents and dissenters]]. Between 30,000 and 50,000 people died by this repression,{{refn|<ref name=Paynedeath/><ref name=ARMH/><ref name=Casanova>Maestre, F.

He nurtured a [[cult of personality]] and the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' became the only channel of participation in Spanish public life. During [[World War II]] he espoused [[neutral country|neutrality]] as [[Spain during World War II|Spain's official wartime policy]], but supported the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&nbsp;\u2014 whose members [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had supported him during the Civil War&nbsp;\u2014 in various ways. After the war, Spain was shunned and [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade. \n\nBy the 1950s the nature of Franco's regime changed from being openly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and severely repressive to an authoritarian system with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].<ref>[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Franco became one of the world's foremost anti-Communist figures and his regime was assisted by [[First World|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Rubottom, R 1984\"/> Spain had suffered chronic economic depression in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but by abandoning [[autarky]] and pursuing economic liberalization Franco presided over the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\". Economic authority was delegated to the [[Technocracy|technocrats]] of the [[Opus Dei and politics#Opus Dei members in Franco's government|Opus Dei]], leading to tremendous economic growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/timreuter/2014/05/19/before-chinas-transformation-there-was-the-spanish-miracle/#f5da6133b3e1 | title= Before China's Transformation, There Was The 'Spanish Miracle'| work=Forbes Magazine | accessdate=22 August 2017 | date=19 May 2014 | first=Tim | last=Reuter}}</ref>\n\nThe Francoist dictatorship continued to soften over time and [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] became Franco's ''[[\u00e9minence grise]]'', controlling the day-to-day operations of the government: this increased when Franco began showing symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]] in the 1960s. The introduction of the [[Organic Law of the State|Organic Law in 1966]] limited and clearly defined Franco's powers and officially created the office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, beset with old age, sickness, and wishing to partially relinquish the burden of governing Spain, Franco resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Carrero Blanco. However, Franco remained as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82 and was buried in the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]]. Through the power to appoint a king, granted to him by the 1947 [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State]], he restored the monarchy before his death, appointing [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as his successor and [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]. Juan Carlos led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\n\nFranco remains a controversial figure in Spanish history and the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved very adaptable, which could introduce social and economic reform, and the only consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[National Catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Freemasonry]], and [[anti-Communism]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]\nFranco was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\">[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1</ref> He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo;<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\"/> Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth.\n\nFranco was born into a seafaring family.

Her father, Landislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in el Ferrol.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 3</ref> The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] (Ferrol, 1891\u20131977) and [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]], and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 \u2013 Madrid, 1989), and Mar\u00eda de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 \u2013 Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ram\u00f3n was an internationally renown pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8-9}} Mar\u00eda del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jar\u00e1iz y Jer\u00e9z and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}}\n\nFranco's father was an officer of the naval supply system who reached the rank of ''Intendente General'' (equivalent to Vice Admiral). He was an unconventional man, a well read free-thinker, agnostic and somewhat of a libertine. Franco's mother, by contrast, was loving, pious and self-sacrificing, obedient to her husband and never speaking ill of him despite suffering at his hand. When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid after receiving a reassignment there and he would ultimately abandon his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5-8}}\n\n== Military career ==\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was quite short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12\u201315}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one tesitcle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, \"hombre de un s\u00f3lo test\u00edculo\" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAt that time, abdominal wounds in Africa were normally fatal. His improbable survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (in Islam, the beneficent force from God ). He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]]</ref>\n\nWith that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco \u2013 la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of April 12, 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by War Minister [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted, however.\n\nThe elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora|Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84-85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. However the entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left.  The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=88}} A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the ''Alianza Obrera''.

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}</ref> Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments. Soviet officers were in effective charge of military operations on the Madrid front. Kennan believes that this operation was originally conducted in good faith with no other purpose than saving the Republic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Russia and the West under Lenin and Stalin|last=Kennan|first=George|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=309}}</ref> Effort was made to encourage the Spanish Communist Party to seize power<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=381}}</ref> but the holding of Alc\u00e1zar was an important morale and propaganda success for the Nationalists, because it is clear that Hitler's primary aim was not a Franco victory but to prolong the war by the active intervention of the Soviet Government as well as Italy, Britain, and France in the Civil War.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=393}}</ref>\n\nHitler told his Generals on 5 November 1937: \"A 100 per cent victory for Franco was not desirable either\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=German Documents Volume 1, Document 19|last=|first=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, by February 1937 the Soviet Union's military help started to taper off, to be replaced by limited economic aid. A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}</ref> Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks in order to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash. Therefore, in the nationalist zone, \"political life ceased.\"<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 258</ref> Initially, only military command mattered; this was divided into regional commands ([[Emilio Mola]] in the North, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] in [[Seville]] commanding [[Andalusia]], Franco with an independent command and [[Miguel Cabanellas]] in [[Zaragoza]] commanding [[Aragon]]). The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state. Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and also he had cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 420\u2013422.</ref>\n\nOn 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[Generalissimo|General\u00edsimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]).<ref name=Thomas424>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 424.</ref> When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later (which some believe was an assassination) (2 June 1937), no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 689\u2013690.</ref>\n\n=== Military command ===\n[[File:J mmue 202444 1 00001.jpg|thumb|Franco and other rebel commanders during the Civil War, {{circa|1936\u20131939}}]]\nFranco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war. Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193</ref> After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\nThe Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios.

Historian James S. Corum states:\n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S. Corum, \"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936\u20131939,\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68\u201390 quotation at p. 75.</ref>\nHistorian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H.

Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172</ref> In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\"<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234</ref> The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\n\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, [[Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and in a vow, promised that he would never again take up his sword unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.\n\nAlthough Germany had recognised the Franco Government, Franco's policy towards Germany was extremely cautious until spectacular German victories at the beginning of the Second World War. An early indication that Franco was going to keep his distance from Germany soon proved true'''.'''<ref name=\":0\" /> A rumoured state visit by Franco to Germany did not take place and a further rumour of a visit by Goering to Spain, after he had enjoyed a cruise in the Western Mediterranean, again did not materialise.

The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.<ref>[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.</ref> According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power.

Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\n\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar (27 October 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20170129082010/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20071027/flamenco-for-foreigners/ \"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\"] Associated Press.</ref> were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered \"Spanish\" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and [[abortion]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s a woman could not have a bank account without a [[co-sign]] by her father or husband.<ref>Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd. London. {{ISBN|0802716741}}. p. 211.</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n=== The Spanish colonial empire and decolonisation ===\n{{Further|Spanish Empire}}\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under pressure from the [[United Nations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95\u2013116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref> Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year it ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5808497fa94e6896ad350d122c578ef431528b7e}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince Juan Carlos in 1969]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.\n\nHowever, when Juan Carlos asked Franco if he could sit in on cabinet meetings, Franco would not permit him saying; \"You would do things differently.\"<ref>Conversation between David Brightly (Ambassador to Spain 1994\u20131998) and John Holroyd-Doveton</ref> Due to the spread of democracy excluding the Soviet block in Europe since the Second World War, Juan Carlos could or would not have been a dictator in the way Franco had been.\n\nBy 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The [[assassination]] of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a [[coma]] and was put on [[life support]]. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2014 the same date as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the founder of the [[Falange]]. Historian [[Ricardo de la Cierva]] claimed that he had been told around 6 pm on 19 November that Franco had already died.<ref>{{cite book |last=de la Cierva |first=Ricardo|authorlink=Ricardo de la Cierva|title=Agonia y Muerte de Franco|language=Spanish|trans-title=Agony and Death of Franco|publisher=Eudema Universidad|date=1996 |pages=|chapter=|isbn=9788477542179}}</ref> Juan Carlos was proclaimed King two days later.\n\nFranco's body was interred at [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]], a colossal memorial built by the forced labour of [[political prisoner]]s in order to honour the casualties of both sides of the Spanish Civil War.<ref>https://www.elindependiente.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/informe_expertos_valle_caidos.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1957/226/A00834-00835.pdf</ref> The site was designated by the interim Government, assured by Prince [[Juan Carlos]] and Prime Minister [[Carlos Arias Navarro]], as the burial place for Franco.

1939 to 1975. During his rule Franco assumed the title ''[[Caudillo]]''.

But due to the navy being crippled by the [[Spanish-American War]] Franco instead joined the [[Spanish Army]] as a cadet in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]] in 1907, graduating in 1910. He would then go on to serve in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics. In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33, the youngest General in all Europe,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918\u20131926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018</ref> and two years later he became director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} \n\nAs a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and a [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]]. For a time he was even left without posting, but his career improved after the right-wing [[Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]]. In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|uprising]] in [[Asturias]], sharpening the antagonism between [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the country. In 1935 he became [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]], but when the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] Franco was once again marginalized, being relieved of his position and relegated to the [[Canary Islands]]. When [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]], leader of the opposition, was murdered that summer it triggered [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which had been plotted since the election in February. Franco had initially kept his distance from the plot, but joined in the last minute with complete resolution. The coup failed and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. \n\nFranco took control of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], which was air-lifted to Spain. With the death of the other leading generals, Franco became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader and was appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936\u20131975)|Head of State]] in the autumn of 1936. By a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] in 1937 Franco merged all [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist parties]] into a [[one-party state|single party]], the [[FET y de las JONS]]. In 1939 the Nationalists had won the war, which had claimed almost half a million lives. The victory extended [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] over all of Spain, and it was followed by a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents and dissenters]]. Between 30,000 and 50,000 people died by this repression,{{refn|<ref name=Paynedeath/><ref name=ARMH/><ref name=Casanova>Maestre, F.

He nurtured a [[cult of personality]] and the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' became the only channel of participation in Spanish public life. During [[World War II]] he espoused [[neutral country|neutrality]] as [[Spain during World War II|Spain's official wartime policy]], but supported the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&nbsp;\u2014 whose members [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had supported him during the Civil War&nbsp;\u2014 in various ways. After the war, Spain was shunned and [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade. \n\nBy the 1950s the nature of Franco's regime changed from being openly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and severely repressive to an authoritarian system with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].<ref>[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Franco became one of the world's foremost anti-Communist figures and his regime was assisted by [[First World|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Rubottom, R 1984\"/> Spain had suffered chronic economic depression in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but by abandoning [[autarky]] and pursuing economic liberalization Franco presided over the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

The introduction of the [[Organic Law of the State|Organic Law in 1966]] limited and clearly defined Franco's powers and officially created the office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, beset with old age, sickness, and wishing to partially relinquish the burden of governing Spain, Franco resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Carrero Blanco. However, Franco remained as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82 and was buried in the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]]. Through the power to appoint a king, granted to him by the 1947 [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State]], he restored the monarchy before his death, appointing [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as his successor and [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]. Juan Carlos led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\n\nFranco remains a controversial figure in Spanish history and the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved very adaptable, which could introduce social and economic reform, and the only consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[National Catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Freemasonry]], and [[anti-Communism]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]\nFranco was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\">[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1</ref> He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo;<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\"/> Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth.\n\nFranco was born into a seafaring family.

May, ''Francisco Franco: The Jewish Connection'' is somewhat fanciful\".<ref name=\"ancest\"/> Furthermore, \"a significant portion of the Spanish and Portuguese populations have some remote Jewish ancestry; if this were true of Franco he would simply be in the position of millions of other Spaniards.\"<ref name=\"ancest\">[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 68</ref>}} After relocating to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the family was strongly involved in the [[Spanish Navy]], and over the span of two centuries produced naval officers for six uninterrupted generations, down to Franco's father Nicol\u00e1s Franco y Salgado Ara\u00fajo (22 November 1855 \u2013 22 February 1942).\n\nHis mother was Mar\u00eda del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (15 October 1865 \u2013 28 February 1934) from an upper middle-class [[Roman Catholic]] family. Her father, Landislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port.

The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ram\u00f3n was an internationally renown pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8-9}} Mar\u00eda del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jar\u00e1iz y Jer\u00e9z and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}}\n\nFranco's father was an officer of the naval supply system who reached the rank of ''Intendente General'' (equivalent to Vice Admiral). He was an unconventional man, a well read free-thinker, agnostic and somewhat of a libertine. Franco's mother, by contrast, was loving, pious and self-sacrificing, obedient to her husband and never speaking ill of him despite suffering at his hand. When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid after receiving a reassignment there and he would ultimately abandon his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5-8}}\n\n== Military career ==\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was quite short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12\u201315}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one tesitcle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, \"hombre de un s\u00f3lo test\u00edculo\" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAt that time, abdominal wounds in Africa were normally fatal. His improbable survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (in Islam, the beneficent force from God ). He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]]</ref>\n\nWith that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco \u2013 la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of April 12, 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by War Minister [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted, however.\n\nThe elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora|Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84-85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. However the entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left.  The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=88}} A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the ''Alianza Obrera''.

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}</ref> Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments. Soviet officers were in effective charge of military operations on the Madrid front.

A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}</ref> Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks in order to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash. Therefore, in the nationalist zone, \"political life ceased.\"<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 258</ref> Initially, only military command mattered; this was divided into regional commands ([[Emilio Mola]] in the North, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] in [[Seville]] commanding [[Andalusia]], Franco with an independent command and [[Miguel Cabanellas]] in [[Zaragoza]] commanding [[Aragon]]). The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state. Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and also he had cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 420\u2013422.</ref>\n\nOn 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[Generalissimo|General\u00edsimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]).<ref name=Thomas424>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 424.</ref> When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later (which some believe was an assassination) (2 June 1937), no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 689\u2013690.</ref>\n\n=== Military command ===\n[[File:J mmue 202444 1 00001.jpg|thumb|Franco and other rebel commanders during the Civil War, {{circa|1936\u20131939}}]]\nFranco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war. Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193</ref> After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\nThe Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, pp.193-195</ref>\n* the reckless policies of the Popular Front government in the weeks prior to the war, where it ignored potential dangers and alienated the opposition, encouraging more people to join the rebellion,\n* the superior military cohesion amongst the Nationalists,\n* the Franco's own leadership, which helped unify the various Nationalist factions, as well as his diplomatic skill, which helped the Nationalists secure military aid from Italy and Germany and keep democracies such as Britain and France out of the war,\n* the Nationalists' effective use of a smaller navy; the Nationalists acquired the most powerful ships in the Spanish fleet and maintained an effective officer corp, while the Republican sailors often liquidated their officers. They used their ships aggressively to hunt down the opposition, whilst the Republicans had a largely passive naval strategy,\n* the greater foreign aid during the war, as well as more efficient use of foreign aid and effective augmentation of Nationalist forces with captured arms and soldiers from the Republicans,\n* the more efficient mobilisation of economic assets,\n* the successful integration of a substantial portion of Republican prisoners-of war-into the Nationalist army (proportionately one the greatest out of any army in any 20th-century European civil war),<ref>Matthews, James. \"\u2018Our Red Soldiers\u2019: The Nationalist Army's Management of its Left-Wing Conscripts in the Spanish Civil War 1936\u20139.\" Journal of Contemporary History 45, no. 2 (2010): 344-363.</ref><ref>Michael Seidman,[http://www.christiebooks.com/ChristieBooksWP/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seidman-Victimized-TLS-7-Sep-12.pdf ''Victimized''], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 07.09.12</ref>\n* the Republican disunity and infighting at multiple levels,\n* the destructive consequences of the revolution in the Republican zone; mobilisation was impeded, the Republican image was harmed abroad in democracies and the war against religion crystallised massive and unremitting Catholic support for the Nationalists,\n* the Nationalists ability to build a larger air force and more effective use of their air force, particularly in supporting ground operations and bombing; the Nationalists also generally enjoyed air superiority from mid-1937 onwards.\n\n=== Political command ===\nThe Nazis were disappointed with Franco's resistance to installing fascism. Historian James S. Corum states:\n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S. Corum, \"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936\u20131939,\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68\u201390 quotation at p. 75.</ref>\nHistorian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H.

Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172</ref> In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\"<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234</ref> The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\n\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, [[Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and in a vow, promised that he would never again take up his sword unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.\n\nAlthough Germany had recognised the Franco Government, Franco's policy towards Germany was extremely cautious until spectacular German victories at the beginning of the Second World War. An early indication that Franco was going to keep his distance from Germany soon proved true'''.'''<ref name=\":0\" /> A rumoured state visit by Franco to Germany did not take place and a further rumour of a visit by Goering to Spain, after he had enjoyed a cruise in the Western Mediterranean, again did not materialise.

Some historians argue that Franco made demands he knew Hitler would not accede to in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that Franco, as the leader of a destroyed and bankrupt country in chaos following a brutal three-year civil war, simply had little to offer the Axis and that the Spanish armed forces were not ready for a major war.

For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.<ref>[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.</ref> According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power.

It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\n\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], who promoted economic modernisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034 |title=The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest |work=A Country Study: Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with U.S. President [[Dwight D.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity.

Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and [[abortion]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s a woman could not have a bank account without a [[co-sign]] by her father or husband.<ref>Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd. London. {{ISBN|0802716741}}. p. 211.</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n=== The Spanish colonial empire and decolonisation ===\n{{Further|Spanish Empire}}\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under pressure from the [[United Nations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95\u2013116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref> Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year it ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5808497fa94e6896ad350d122c578ef431528b7e}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince Juan Carlos in 1969]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.\n\nHowever, when Juan Carlos asked Franco if he could sit in on cabinet meetings, Franco would not permit him saying; \"You would do things differently.\"<ref>Conversation between David Brightly (Ambassador to Spain 1994\u20131998) and John Holroyd-Doveton</ref> Due to the spread of democracy excluding the Soviet block in Europe since the Second World War, Juan Carlos could or would not have been a dictator in the way Franco had been.\n\nBy 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The [[assassination]] of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a [[coma]] and was put on [[life support]]. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2014 the same date as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the founder of the [[Falange]].

Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the [[IMAX Corporation]] (founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation, Limited), and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ieee.ca/millennium/imax/imax_birth.html |title=The Birth of IMAX |publisher=Ieee.ca |date= |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref> Unlike conventional film projectors, the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock.\n\n==History==\n[[File:IMAX comparison.svg|thumb|A comparison between 35&nbsp;mm and 15/70&nbsp;mm negative areas.]]\nThe IMAX film standard uses [[70&nbsp;mm film]] run through the projector horizontally. This technique produces an area that is nine times larger than the [[35 mm movie film|35 mm format]], and three times larger than 70&nbsp;mm film which was run conventionally through the projector in a vertical orientation.<ref name=\"gizmodo.com\">[https://gizmodo.com/how-regular-movies-become-imax-films-5250780 How Regular Movies Become \"IMAX\" Films], by Mark Wilson (Gizmodo.com, published May 29, 2009)</ref>\n\nThe desire to increase the visual impact of film has a long history. In 1929, [[Fox Film|Fox]] introduced [[70&nbsp;mm Grandeur film|Fox Grandeur]], the first 70&nbsp;mm film format, but it quickly fell from use.<ref>[[70 mm Grandeur film]]</ref> In the 1950s, the potential of [[35 mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] to provide wider projected images was explored in the processes of [[CinemaScope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] (1954), following multi-[[Movie projector|projector]] systems such as [[Cinerama]] (1952). While impressive, Cinerama was difficult to install and maintain, requiring careful alignment and synchronization of the multiple projectors. During [[Expo 67]] in Montreal, the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'' and Ferguson's ''Man and the Polar Regions'' both used complex multi-projector, multi-screen systems. Each encountered technical difficulties that led them to found a company called \"Multiscreen\", with a goal of developing a simpler approach.\n\n===Multiscreen Corporation===\nThe single-projector/single-camera system they eventually settled upon was designed and built by Shaw based upon a novel \"Rol shop worker from Brisbane, Australia.<ref>see {{US patent|3494524}}</ref>  Film projectors do not continuously flow the film in front of the bulb, but instead \"stutter\" the film travel so that each frame can be illuminated in a momentarily-paused still image. This requires a mechanical apparatus to buffer the jerky travel of the film strip. The older technology of running 70&nbsp;mm film vertically through the projector used only five sprocket perforations on the sides of each frame; however, the IMAX method used fifteen perforations per frame.<ref name=\"gizmodo.com\"/>  The previous mechanism was inadequate to handle this intermittent mechanical movement that was three times longer, and so Jones's invention was necessary for the novel IMAX projector method with its horizontal film feed. As it became clear that a single, large-screen image had more impact than multiple smaller ones and was a more viable product direction, Multiscreen changed its name to IMAX. Cofounder Graeme Ferguson explained how the name IMAX originated:\n\n<blockquote>\"... the incorporation date [of the company was] September 1967. ... [The name change] came a year or two later. We first called the company Multiscreen Corporation because that, in fact, was what people knew us as. ... After about a year, our attorney informed us that we could never copyright or trademark Multivision. It was too generic. It was a descriptive word. The words that you can copyright are words like Kleenex or Xerox or Coca-Cola. If the name is descriptive, you can't trademark it so you have to make up a word. So we were sitting at lunch one day in a Hungarian restaurant in Montreal and we worked out a name on a placemat on which we wrote all the possible names we could think of. We kept working with the idea of maximum image. We turned it around and came up with IMAX.\"<ref>[http://www.northernstars.ca/ferguson_graeme_article/ IMAX at 30: An Interview with Graeme Ferguson] by Wyndham Wise (originally published in Take One magazine, Issue #17, Fall 1997)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe name change actually happened more than two years later, because a key patent filed on January 16, 1970, was assigned under the original name Multiscreen Corporation, Limited.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US3944349A Shutter assembly (Patent#US3944349A)]</ref>  IMAX Chief Administration Officer Mary Ruby was quoted as saying, \"Although many people may think \"IMAX\" is an [[acronym]], it is, in fact, a made-up word.\"<ref>[https://www.managingip.com/Article/1257879/Latest-News-Magazine/The-full-picture.html?ArticleId=1257879 Managing IP, INTA Daily News article]</ref>\n\n===IMAX Corporation===\n[[File:IMAX film projector 2011 Bradford.jpg|thumb|upright|IMAX projector with horizontal film reel]]\n''[[Tiger Child]]'', the first IMAX film, was demonstrated at [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/imax/imax_chronology.html |title=IMAX'S Chronology of Techonological (sic) Events |accessdate=February 23, 2010 |publisher=IEEE Canada, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers}}</ref> The first permanent IMAX installation was built at the [[Cinesphere]] theatre at [[Ontario Place]] in Toronto.

It became the first IMAX Theatre to not be partnered with any other brand of movie theatres. About five million visitors viewed the screen, which covered the viewer's total visual field when looking directly forward. This created a sensation of motion in most viewers, and [[motion sickness]] in some.\n\nAnother IMAX 3D theatre was also built in Spokane; however, its screen-size is less than half. Due to protests, the City of Spokane officials decided to work with the IMAX Corporation to demolish the theatre, under the condition they renovate the former US Pavilion itself into IMAX's first permanent ''outdoor'' giant-screen theatre. The plan was to use material on the inside of the structure similar to that used when first constructed. However, it was expected to last only five years, due to weather conditions destroying previous materials.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/sep/30/imax-theater-in-riverfront-park-headed-for-demolit/ |title= Imax theater in Riverfront Park headed for demolition; fate of pavilion rides still in question |publisher= The Spokesmen-Review |date= Sep 30, 2016 |accessdate= May 24, 2017}}</ref> Concept art has been released in videos featured on Spokane's renovation site, and its budget revealed that seating is planned for more than 2,000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://riverfrontparknow.com/redevelopment/u-s-pavilion-shelters/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160216021903/http://riverfrontparknow.com/redevelopment/u-s-pavilion-shelters/ |url-status=dead |archive-date= February 16, 2016 |title= US Pavilion & Shelters |publisher= City of Spokane |accessdate= May 24, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://static.spokanecity.org/documents/parksrec/aboutus/planning/2014-riverfront-park-master-plan.pdf |title=2014 Riverfront Park Master Plan |publisher= City of Spokane |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent IMAX Dome installation, the Eugene Heikoff and Marilyn Jacobs Heikoff Dome Theatre at the [[Reuben H.

In a conventional 65mm camera, the film passes vertically through the camera, five perforations at a time, or 34 metres per minute. In comparison, in a conventional 35mm camera, 35mm film passes vertically through the camera, at four (smaller) perforations at a time, which translates to 27.4 metres per minute.<ref name=\"Slash Film\"/>\n\nIn the [[Todd-AO]] 70mm-format of widescreen cinema, the image area of a 65mm film-frame is {{convert|48.5|x|22.1|mm|in|abbr=on}}; in the IMAX-format of widescreen cinema, the film-frame dimensions are {{convert|69.6|x|48.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh {{convert|250|kg|lb}}. IMAX uses ESTAR-based print film<ref>Kodak's trade name for biaxially oriented PET film</ref> in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process does not change the size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX's pin registration system (''especially the camera mechanism'') does not tolerate either [[sprocket]]-hole or film-thickness variations.\n\n===Soundtrack - double-system===\nTo use more of the image area, IMAX film does not include an embedded soundtrack. Instead, the IMAX system specifies a separate six-channel {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} magnetic film, recorded and played back on a [[Sound follower|film follower]] locked to picture, just as [[Vitaphone]] had been (utilizing 16-inch 33 1/3 RPM [[Old-time radio#Electrical transcription discs|electrical transcription discs]]) in the early 20th century, and was the same technology used to provide the 7-channel soundtrack accompanying films photographed and exhibited in the [[Cinerama]] process in the mid-1950s. By the early 1990s, a separate [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]-based 6-track digital sound system was used, similarly locked to the projector by a [[SMPTE time code]] synchronization apparatus, the audio played off a series of proprietarily encoded [[CD-ROM]] discs. In the late 1990s, IMAX upgraded this system to use a [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] that carries a single uncompressed [[Audio file format|audio]] file that contains the six channels. These are converted directly to analogue rather than processed through a decoding method such as [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]].\n\nLike conventional theatres, IMAX theatres place speakers both directly behind the acoustically-transparent screen, and around the theatre to create a \"surround sound\" effect. IMAX also provides a \"top center\" speaker in addition to the centre speaker found in conventional theatres. This extra channel allows the sound mix engineers to take advantage of the screen's greater height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/big-enough-everest-inside-imax-sound/373444 |title=Big Enough for Everest: Inside IMAX Sound |publisher=DigitalContentProducer.com | date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Projectors===\n[[File:Xenon IMAX 1.jpg|thumb|The 15 kW [[Xenon arc lamp|Xenon short-arc lamp]] used in IMAX projectors]]\nTransporting the large film stock through the optical system presented challenges for both the camera and the projector. Conventional [[70&nbsp;mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] systems were not steady enough for the 586\u00d7 magnification. On the projector side, William Shaw adapted an Australian patent for film transport called the \"rolling loop\" by adding a [[compressed air]] \"puffer\" to accelerate the film, and put a [[cylindrical lens]] in the projector's \"aperture block\".\n\nThe projector uses a [[vacuum]] to pull the film into contact with this lens. Thus the \"[[Field flattener lens|field flattener]]\" flattens the image field. The lens is twice the height of the film and connects to a [[pneumatic]] [[piston]] so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running. This way, if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens, the projectionist can switch to a clean portion of the lens at the push of a button. The lens also has \"wiper bars\" made of a [[felt]] or brush-like material that wipes dust off the lens as it moves up or down.\n\nIMAX projectors are [[pin]]-stabilized; this means that four registration pins engage the [[perforation]]s at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment. Shaw added [[cam]]-controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame \"settled\" onto the registration pins. The projector's [[Movie projector#Shutter|shutter]] is open around 20% longer than in conventional equipment, and the light source is brighter. The [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon short-arc lamps]] are made with a thin envelope of [[fused quartz]] and contain [[xenon]] gas at a pressure of about 25 [[atmosphere (pressure)|atmospheres]] ({{convert|367|psi|abbr=on}}). Because of this, projectionists are required to wear protective [[Bulletproof vest|body armor]] when changing or handling the lamp in case it breaks (e.g., due to a drop to the floor) because of the danger from flying quartz shards propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within.

The standard IMAX projector was unsuitable for use inside a dome because it had a {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lamp house on top. IMAX Corporation redesigned its system, adding an [[elevator]] to lift the projector to the center of the dome from the projection booth below. Spectra Physics designed a suitable lamphouse that took smaller, {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} lamps and placed the bulb behind the lens instead of above the projector. In 1970,<ref>[http://www.elcan.com/About_ELCAN/History/ Elcan.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317234532/http://www.elcan.com/About_ELCAN/History/ |date=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> Ernst Leitz Canada, Ltd. (now [[ELCAN Optical Technologies]]) won a contract to develop and manufacture a [[fisheye lens]] projection system optimized to project an image onto a dome instead of a flat screen.\n\nThe dome system, which the San Diego Hall of Science called \"Omnimax\", uses films shot with a camera equipped with a [[fisheye lens]] that squeezes a highly-distorted [[anamorphic]] 180\u00b0 field of view onto the 65&nbsp;mm IMAX film. The lens is aligned below the center of the frame, and most of the bottom half of the circular field falls beyond the edge of the film. The part of the field that would fall below the edge of the dome is masked. When filming, the camera is aimed upward at an angle that matches the tilt of the dome. When projected through a matching fisheye lens onto a dome, the original panoramic view is recreated. Omnimax wraps 180\u00b0 horizontally, 100\u00b0 above the horizon and 22\u00b0 below the horizon for a viewer at the center of the dome. Omnimax premiered in 1973, showing ''[[Voyage to the Outer Planets]]'' (produced by Graphic Films) and ''[[Garden Isle]]'' (by Roger Tilton Films) on a double bill. IMAX has since renamed the system \"IMAX Dome\", but some theaters (primarily those opened before the 2000s) continue to call it \"Omnimax\".\n\nIMAX Dome theatres are used in theme parks and many North American museums, particularly those with a scientific focus, where the technical aspects of the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction. The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing of the equipment in operation, and it is often accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits. For some theaters, before the show begins, the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it.\n\nThe screen may be a permanent fixture, such as at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] ([[Henry Crown Space Center]]) in Chicago, Illinois; the [[Fort Worth Museum of Science and History]]; the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the [[St. Louis Science Center]]; [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston's Museum of Science]]; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond's]] [[Science Museum of Virginia]]; the Charlotte Observer IMAX Dome Theatre at [[Discovery Place]], Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama's [[McWane Science Center]]; [[US Space and Rocket Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama; the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal]] and [[Great Lakes Science Center]] in Cleveland, Ohio, and the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nAlternatively, the dome may be lowered and raised as needed, such as the former installation at the [[Canadian Museum of History]] (where it shared an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen, all replaced with a [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] CINE+ digital theatre system in 2016).<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/history-museum-theatre-upgrades-into-the-future |title=History Museum theatre upgrades into the future |last=Cox |first=Aidan |date=February 29, 2016 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> The entire dome could be raised to show flat screen features, and repositioned for immersive features.\n\nWhile the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films, on special occasions entertainment films are also shown, such as ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' at the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]]. The largest screens in North America are at [[Liberty Science Center]] in Jersey City, New Jersey, and the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Science World]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, both of which have dome screens {{convert|27|m|ft}} in size.\n\nDue to the age of the IMAX Dome format as well as its entirely analogue nature, some theatres may opt to replace their existing IMAX Dome systems with newer, more versatile digital systems. Examples of former IMAX Dome theatres that have had their IMAX equipment replaced with newer equipment include [[Tietomaa|Tietomaa Science Centre]] in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]] (which replaced its IMAX 8/70 equipment from 1988 with a Barco DP4K-32B [[4K resolution|4K]] projection system in 2013),<ref>https://www.ouka.fi/oulu/kulttuuri-ja-kirjastot/ajankohtaista/-/asset_publisher/2fVr/content/tietomaan-jattielokuvateatteri-digiaikaan</ref> the [[Omni-Theatre, Science Centre Singapore|Omni-Theatre at]] [[Science Centre Singapore]],<ref>https://www.es.com/news/clients/2015-07_Singapore.aspx</ref> the [[National Museum of Natural Science]]<ref>https://www.es.com/news/clients/2015-07_Taiwan.aspx</ref> in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]] (which both had their original IMAX Dome 1570 projection systems installed respectively in 1987 and 1985 replaced with [[Evans & Sutherland]] [[Digistar|Digistar 5]] [[8K resolution|8K]] digital systems in 2015), and the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at [[Liberty Science Center]] in [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], which replaced its IMAX Dome 1570 projection system from 1993 (when built was the largest IMAX Dome/OMNIMAX theatre in the world) with an Evans & Sutherland Digistar 6 \"True8K\" digital system in 2017.<ref>https://www.es.com/news/clients/2017-04_LibertyScienceCenter.aspx</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, the Hackworth IMAX dome in The Tech Museum (now [[The Tech Interactive]]) replaced its 70mm IMAX projector with a 4K IMAX Laser projector. It became the first digital IMAX Laser dome theater in the world. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== {{anchor|IMAX 3D}} 3D ===\n{{further|3D film}}\nTo create the illusion of depth, the IMAX [[Stereoscopy|3D]] process uses two separate camera lenses that represent the left and right eyes. The lenses are separated by a distance of {{convert|64|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the average distance between a human's eyes. Two separate rolls of film are used to capture the images they produce. The IMAX 3D camera weighs over {{convert|113|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. By projecting the two films superimposed on the screen and using one of several available methods to direct only the correct image to each eye, viewers see a 3D image on a 2D screen. One method is to use [[polarizer|polarizing filters]] to oppositely [[linear polarization|polarize]] the light used in projecting each image. The viewer wears glasses with polarizing filters oriented to match the projector filters, so that the filter over each eye blocks the light used to project the images intended for the other eye. In another method, the two projections rapidly alternate. While one image is being shown, the projection of its mate is blocked. Each [[film frame|frame]] is shown more than once to increase the rate and suppress flicker. The viewer wears [[Active shutter 3D system|shutter glasses]] with [[liquid crystal display|liquid crystal]]<!-- unfortunately, the \"liquid crystal\" article is dauntingly technical --> shutters that block or transmit light [[synchronization|in sync]] with the projectors, so each eye sees only the images meant for it.\n\nSeveral of the early films that had been produced in [[digital 3D]] for release in conventional theaters<!-- the AE spelling appears to predominate in this article --> were also presented in IMAX 3D, including ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

It uses two 2K-resolution projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). The digital installations have caused some controversy, as many theaters have branded their screens as IMAX after merely retrofitting standard auditoriums with IMAX digital projectors. The screen sizes in these auditoriums are much smaller than those in the purpose-built auditoriums of the original 15/70 IMAX format, and are limited to the 1.90:1 aspect ratio. Another disadvantage is the much lower resolution of digital IMAX.

The expense and logistical challenges of producing and presenting IMAX films have led to approximately 40 minute shorter running times than conventional films. Most are documentaries suited for institutional venues such as museums and [[science museum|science centers]]. IMAX cameras have been used while orbiting the Earth, climbing [[Mount Everest]], exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and visiting the [[Antarctic]]. A film about the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], titled ''[[Roving Mars]]'' (2006), used exclusive data{{clarify|date=December 2015}} from the rovers.<ref name=\"IMAX\"/>\n\nAn early attempt at presenting mainstream entertainment in IMAX format was ''[[Stones at the Max|The Rolling Stones: Live at the Max]]'' (1991), an 85-minute compilation of concert footage filmed in IMAX during the rock band's [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|1990 Steel Wheels tour]], edited to give the impression of a single concert. In the 1990s, more entertainment short films were created, notably ''[[T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]'' in 1998, and ''[[Haunted Castle (2001 film)|Haunted Castle]]'' in 2001 (both in 3D). In 1995, French director [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] directed ''[[Wings of Courage]]'', the first dramatic picture shot for IMAX. In 1998 and 1999, ''[[More (1998 film)|More]]'' and ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1999 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'' became the first short films produced using the IMAX format; both earned Academy Award nominations, with ''Old Man and the Sea'' becoming the only IMAX film to win an Oscar. In 2000, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] produced ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', the first full-length animated feature initially released exclusively in the IMAX format.\n\n=== Use in Hollywood productions ===\nBefore the end of the 1990s, theatrical features were deemed impossible to run in IMAX venues at the time, as there was a technical limitation on the size of the film reel where films had to run around two hours. Originally, IMAX and [[Pixar]] considered releasing ''[[Toy Story]]'' in IMAX 3D, but test results showed that the render resolution could not match the size of the IMAX image.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imax.com/community/blog/close-call/ |title=BLOG @ IMAX: Close Call |publisher=Imax.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030092740/http://www.imax.com/community/blog/close-call/ |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in the early 2000s wanted to re-release ''[[Shrek]]'' in IMAX 3D, but this too was canceled as a result of creative changes in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|author=Studio Briefing |url=http://culture.com/news/item/1423/as-expected-imax-reports-a-loss.phtml |title=As Expected, IMAX Reports A Loss |publisher=Culture.com |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> These failed attempts at re-releases did inspire IMAX to experiment and improve their ability in presenting computer animation in their theaters. Their compilation ''[[CyberWorld]]'' was the result, which contained new original animation and IMAX-presented versions of computer animated tests and music videos. ''Cyberworld'' even presented [[open matte|open-matte]] 3D versions of the bar sequence from ''[[Antz]]'' and the \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI|Homer3]]\" segment from ''[[The Simpsons]]''; both coincidentally were animated at [[Pacific Data Images]].\n\n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] became the first studio to release theatrical films in the IMAX process. Released on New Year's Day in 2000, ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' was the studio's first IMAX release and the first theatrical feature presented in IMAX theaters. It was originally planned as a standard theatrical release, but in agreeing with the company to release the film, the IMAX sound system incorporated a multi-channel and multi-layer stereo system for the orchestrated soundtrack, similar to the [[Fantasound]] system Walt Disney had envisioned for the [[Fantasia (1940 film)|original film]] in 1940. The company agreed to Disney's terms and conditions to gain the exclusive first showings of the film. These included a limited engagement of four months (from January 1 to April 30) and 50% of the box office receipts. Not all IMAX cinemas were prepared to accept Disney's terms to present the film; however, following the IMAX release, a standard 35mm run followed in June at regular theaters.\n\nAlthough ''Fantasia 2000'' had a lukewarm financial run, the critical praise for its use of the IMAX format convinced Disney to put more releases in the giant-screen format in the pipeline. In 2002, IMAX re-issues of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]'' were released in select theaters over the winter and Christmas seasons of that year. New [[digital master]]s were created from the original [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] production files and select scenes of animation were cleaned up to make use of the high resolution IMAX film negatives. ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' was also released in select IMAX theaters and was the first theatrical film released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously. But all of these releases had underwhelming box office returns and Disney canceled later big-screen re-releases, including ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.\n\nWith the unveiling of the DMR process (see below), [[Warner Brothers|Warner Bros. Pictures]] especially embraced the format beginning in 2003 with the two ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded|Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions|Revolutions]]''. Since ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|The Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004, Warner Bros. began releasing [[Harry Potter (film series)|the Harry Potter film franchise]] in IMAX to strong financial success. Also in 2004 the studio released [[Robert Zemeckis]]' motion-capture film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' in IMAX 3D. ''Polar Express'' became the most successful film released in IMAX theaters, producing at least a quarter of the film's gross of $302 million from fewer than 100 IMAX screens.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Success for Warner Bros. and IMAX followed in later years with ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'', ''[[Happy Feet]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. Progressively other studios became further interested in releasing films in IMAX through the DMR process and have earned success through it. In May 2009, [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' was released in IMAX venues for the initial two weeks of its theatrical run and opened to $8.3 million dollars.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003418.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title='Star Trek' beams up $76.5 million |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |work=Variety |date=May 10, 2009}}</ref> The IMAX opening weekends of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2]]'' have since grossed $15 million.\n\nThough they were not filmed with IMAX cameras, ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' were optimized for IMAX digital screens when they were released. Both movies were filmed in high-resolution cameras and the digital negative ratio was equal to that of the IMAX Digital frame. ''Skyfall'' increased the visual information of the entire film while ''Amazing Spider-Man'' optimized the finale battle with the Lizard. When [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' was restored and re-released in theaters there was also specially made an open-matte version for IMAX. In 2010 after years of successful IMAX DMR releases, Warner Bros. signed a deal to release up to 20 feature films in IMAX up to 2013, including educational documentaries that were in production.<ref>{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/money/2010/04/28/13751681.html |title=IMAX inks 20-film deal with Warner Bros. |work=Toronto Sun |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, [[Marvel Studios]] announced that its next two ''Avengers'' films \u2014 ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) \u2014 would be filmed entirely in IMAX, the first Hollywood feature films to do so, using a modified version of [[Arri]]'s Alexa 65 digital camera.

This special [[digital intermediate]] technology let IMAX venues show films shot on 35mm for conventional theaters. In 2002, ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' and an IMAX-format re-release of the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', were the first official applications of the DMR process. Because of projection limitations at the time, the studios had to edit ''Apollo 13'' and ''Attack of the Clones'' to have a shorter playing time. As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters, the later DMR releases did not have this limitation; current platters provide a run time of up to 175 minutes. Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process, which are visually and audibly superior to the same films projected in 35mm.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} But some filmmakers, such as producer [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], point out that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the 70&nbsp;mm 15 perf IMAX format, and that directors [[Ron Howard]] and [[George Lucas]] expected better.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2004/lfca/index.htm |title=Change Comes To LFCA. 2004 LFCA |publisher=In70mm.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> They note that the decline of [[Cinerama]] coincided roughly with its replacement by a simpler, cheaper, technically inferior version, and view DMR with alarm. IMAX originally reserved the phrase \"the IMAX experience\" for true 70&nbsp;mm productions, but now allows its use on DMR productions as well.\n\nAfter ''The Lion King'' in 2003, no Hollywood studio engaged in re-releasing and restoring classic films through the IMAX DMR process until 2012 although ongoing conversion of new releases continued and continued to grow in number. James Cameron's ''Titanic'' underwent both 3D conversion and DMR conversion to 3D in 2012 as did ''Men in Black 3''. In August 2012 IMAX and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced a one-week exclusive re-release of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' on September 7, 2012, to promote the release of the Blu-Ray collection. The film, before it underwent DMR, was already restored in a 4K digital intermediate with 7.1 surround sound from the original negative. The process for IMAX theaters, like with the complete restoration, was supervised by [[Steven Spielberg]] and sound designer [[Ben Burtt]]. \"I didn't know if the 1981 print would stand up to a full IMAX transfer, so I came expecting a sort of grainy, muddy, and overly enlarged representation of the movie I had made years ago\", Spielberg said. \"I was blown away by the fact that it looked better than the movie I had made years ago.\"\n\n===Feature films===\n[[File:Christopher Nolan, London, 2013 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Nolan]] has been a vocal supporter of the IMAX 70 mm film format, and has collaborated with the company since the mid-2000s.<ref name=NolanIMAX>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/features/christopher-nolan-emma-thomas-wow-moments-filming-in-imax-1202721099/|title=Christopher Nolan, Emma Thomas on 'Wow Moments' Filming in Imax|first=Nick|last=Clement|date=March 8, 2018|work=Variety|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref>]]\nMany recent features have employed IMAX cameras for select scenes, however, before 2018 no full-length feature film was shot entirely using IMAX cameras due to the numerous difficulties presented with the format \u2013 the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras and the noise they produced made dialogue recording difficult.<ref name=\"Slash\">{{cite web|title=How The Dark Knight Went IMAX|publisher=Slash Film|date=June 14, 2008 | url = https://www.slashfilm.com/how-the-dark-knight-went-imax/| accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> The 70mm cameras have short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes<ref name=\"Slash\"/> and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film.<ref name=\"Wrap\">{{cite web|title=3D a 'Flash in the Pan' \u2013 'Inception' Cinematographer|publisher=The Wrap|date=November 12, 2010 | url = https://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/inception-cinematographer-3-d-may-be-flash-pan-22480| accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> However, these issues have been minimized thanks to the digital Arri Alexa IMAX camera, with two films having been shot entirely with the camera.<ref name=infinity>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/avengers-infinity-war-to-be-shot-entirely-with-imax-cameras-1201489782/|title='Avengers: Infinity War' to Be Shot Entirely With Imax Cameras|date=7 May 2015|first=Brent|last=Lang|accessdate=7 March 2016|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' features six sequences (a total of 28 minutes) shot using IMAX.

Pictures press notes, ''The Dark Knight''</ref> Even before ''Dark Knight'', Nolan had wanted to shoot a film in the IMAX format, and he also used it for quiet scenes that it would make pictorially interesting. Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: \"if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie.\" Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative to eliminate generation loss, while scenes that were digitally mastered were scanned and printed out at 8 thousand lines of horizontal resolution (8K).<ref name=fxguide>{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/dark_knight_imax_effects_and_that_bike/|title=Dark Knight : Imax, Effects and That Bike|first=Mike|last=Seymour|date=July 21, 2008|work=fxguide.com|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> When the film opened in 94 IMAX venues in 2008, all of them were sold out for the opening weekend.\n\nA year later, director [[Michael Bay]] was inspired by IMAX's use in ''The Dark Knight'' to feature big-screen sequences in ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive Video: Director Michael Bay talks Transformers Revenge of the Fallen|publisher=Collider|date=February 9, 2009 | url = https://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/10866/tcid/1 | accessdate=April 16, 2010}}</ref> The film's co-writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, but Bay later said that considering himself an \"old school\" filmmaker, he found 3D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras. The IMAX version of the film, in the end, contained almost ten minutes of IMAX-filmed footage out of the two and a half hour film. Bay later partially filmed the third Transformers film, ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' in 3D but without IMAX. Bay returned to IMAX for the fourth film, ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'', in 2014.

However, unlike the previous films, where he used the cameras for select sequences, Nolan used IMAX as the primary shooting format, with 75% (about 79 minutes) of the 106-minute film featuring footage shot in 70mm IMAX (breaking the aforementioned record that a previous Nolan film, ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', held). This was possible due to the sparsity of dialogue in the film, as 15/70mm IMAX cameras are notoriously noisy (a few dialogue-heavy scenes were shot with regular 70mm film cameras). IMAX cameras were also used hand-held for the first time, as Nolan was advised by both [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Ron Howard]] that it was the best way to shoot on vessels. ''Dunkirk'' received the widest release on 70mm IMAX since his last film, ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', with the film being released on the format in 37 theaters around the world. The director's upcoming 2020 film, ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]],'' will be filmed mostly in IMAX.

In 1929, [[Fox Film|Fox]] introduced [[70&nbsp;mm Grandeur film|Fox Grandeur]], the first 70&nbsp;mm film format, but it quickly fell from use.<ref>[[70 mm Grandeur film]]</ref> In the 1950s, the potential of [[35 mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] to provide wider projected images was explored in the processes of [[CinemaScope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] (1954), following multi-[[Movie projector|projector]] systems such as [[Cinerama]] (1952). While impressive, Cinerama was difficult to install and maintain, requiring careful alignment and synchronization of the multiple projectors. During [[Expo 67]] in Montreal, the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'' and Ferguson's ''Man and the Polar Regions'' both used complex multi-projector, multi-screen systems. Each encountered technical difficulties that led them to found a company called \"Multiscreen\", with a goal of developing a simpler approach.\n\n===Multiscreen Corporation===\nThe single-projector/single-camera system they eventually settled upon was designed and built by Shaw based upon a novel \"Rol shop worker from Brisbane, Australia.<ref>see {{US patent|3494524}}</ref>  Film projectors do not continuously flow the film in front of the bulb, but instead \"stutter\" the film travel so that each frame can be illuminated in a momentarily-paused still image. This requires a mechanical apparatus to buffer the jerky travel of the film strip. The older technology of running 70&nbsp;mm film vertically through the projector used only five sprocket perforations on the sides of each frame; however, the IMAX method used fifteen perforations per frame.<ref name=\"gizmodo.com\"/>  The previous mechanism was inadequate to handle this intermittent mechanical movement that was three times longer, and so Jones's invention was necessary for the novel IMAX projector method with its horizontal film feed. As it became clear that a single, large-screen image had more impact than multiple smaller ones and was a more viable product direction, Multiscreen changed its name to IMAX. Cofounder Graeme Ferguson explained how the name IMAX originated:\n\n<blockquote>\"... the incorporation date [of the company was] September 1967. ... [The name change] came a year or two later. We first called the company Multiscreen Corporation because that, in fact, was what people knew us as. ... After about a year, our attorney informed us that we could never copyright or trademark Multivision. It was too generic. It was a descriptive word. The words that you can copyright are words like Kleenex or Xerox or Coca-Cola. If the name is descriptive, you can't trademark it so you have to make up a word. So we were sitting at lunch one day in a Hungarian restaurant in Montreal and we worked out a name on a placemat on which we wrote all the possible names we could think of. We kept working with the idea of maximum image. We turned it around and came up with IMAX.\"<ref>[http://www.northernstars.ca/ferguson_graeme_article/ IMAX at 30: An Interview with Graeme Ferguson] by Wyndham Wise (originally published in Take One magazine, Issue #17, Fall 1997)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe name change actually happened more than two years later, because a key patent filed on January 16, 1970, was assigned under the original name Multiscreen Corporation, Limited.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US3944349A Shutter assembly (Patent#US3944349A)]</ref>  IMAX Chief Administration Officer Mary Ruby was quoted as saying, \"Although many people may think \"IMAX\" is an [[acronym]], it is, in fact, a made-up word.\"<ref>[https://www.managingip.com/Article/1257879/Latest-News-Magazine/The-full-picture.html?ArticleId=1257879 Managing IP, INTA Daily News article]</ref>\n\n===IMAX Corporation===\n[[File:IMAX film projector 2011 Bradford.jpg|thumb|upright|IMAX projector with horizontal film reel]]\n''[[Tiger Child]]'', the first IMAX film, was demonstrated at [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/imax/imax_chronology.html |title=IMAX'S Chronology of Techonological (sic) Events |accessdate=February 23, 2010 |publisher=IEEE Canada, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers}}</ref> The first permanent IMAX installation was built at the [[Cinesphere]] theatre at [[Ontario Place]] in Toronto.

In a conventional 65mm camera, the film passes vertically through the camera, five perforations at a time, or 34 metres per minute.

IMAX uses ESTAR-based print film<ref>Kodak's trade name for biaxially oriented PET film</ref> in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process does not change the size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX's pin registration system (''especially the camera mechanism'') does not tolerate either [[sprocket]]-hole or film-thickness variations.\n\n===Soundtrack - double-system===\nTo use more of the image area, IMAX film does not include an embedded soundtrack. Instead, the IMAX system specifies a separate six-channel {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} magnetic film, recorded and played back on a [[Sound follower|film follower]] locked to picture, just as [[Vitaphone]] had been (utilizing 16-inch 33 1/3 RPM [[Old-time radio#Electrical transcription discs|electrical transcription discs]]) in the early 20th century, and was the same technology used to provide the 7-channel soundtrack accompanying films photographed and exhibited in the [[Cinerama]] process in the mid-1950s. By the early 1990s, a separate [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]-based 6-track digital sound system was used, similarly locked to the projector by a [[SMPTE time code]] synchronization apparatus, the audio played off a series of proprietarily encoded [[CD-ROM]] discs. In the late 1990s, IMAX upgraded this system to use a [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] that carries a single uncompressed [[Audio file format|audio]] file that contains the six channels. These are converted directly to analogue rather than processed through a decoding method such as [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]].\n\nLike conventional theatres, IMAX theatres place speakers both directly behind the acoustically-transparent screen, and around the theatre to create a \"surround sound\" effect. IMAX also provides a \"top center\" speaker in addition to the centre speaker found in conventional theatres. This extra channel allows the sound mix engineers to take advantage of the screen's greater height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/big-enough-everest-inside-imax-sound/373444 |title=Big Enough for Everest: Inside IMAX Sound |publisher=DigitalContentProducer.com | date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Projectors===\n[[File:Xenon IMAX 1.jpg|thumb|The 15 kW [[Xenon arc lamp|Xenon short-arc lamp]] used in IMAX projectors]]\nTransporting the large film stock through the optical system presented challenges for both the camera and the projector. Conventional [[70&nbsp;mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] systems were not steady enough for the 586\u00d7 magnification. On the projector side, William Shaw adapted an Australian patent for film transport called the \"rolling loop\" by adding a [[compressed air]] \"puffer\" to accelerate the film, and put a [[cylindrical lens]] in the projector's \"aperture block\".\n\nThe projector uses a [[vacuum]] to pull the film into contact with this lens. Thus the \"[[Field flattener lens|field flattener]]\" flattens the image field. The lens is twice the height of the film and connects to a [[pneumatic]] [[piston]] so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running. This way, if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens, the projectionist can switch to a clean portion of the lens at the push of a button. The lens also has \"wiper bars\" made of a [[felt]] or brush-like material that wipes dust off the lens as it moves up or down.\n\nIMAX projectors are [[pin]]-stabilized; this means that four registration pins engage the [[perforation]]s at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment. Shaw added [[cam]]-controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame \"settled\" onto the registration pins. The projector's [[Movie projector#Shutter|shutter]] is open around 20% longer than in conventional equipment, and the light source is brighter. The [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon short-arc lamps]] are made with a thin envelope of [[fused quartz]] and contain [[xenon]] gas at a pressure of about 25 [[atmosphere (pressure)|atmospheres]] ({{convert|367|psi|abbr=on}}). Because of this, projectionists are required to wear protective [[Bulletproof vest|body armor]] when changing or handling the lamp in case it breaks (e.g., due to a drop to the floor) because of the danger from flying quartz shards propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within. An IMAX projector weighs up to 1.8 tonnes (2 [[short tons]]) and is over {{convert|178|cm|ft|1|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|195|cm|ft|1|abbr=on}} long.\n\nIMAX Corporation has released four projector types that use its 15-perforation, [[70&nbsp;mm film]] format: '''GT''' (Grand Theatre), '''GT 3D''' (dual rotor), '''SR''' (Small Rotor), and '''MPX''', which was designed for retrofitted theatres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/images/corporate/pdfs/filmmaker.pdf|title=The 15/70 Filmmaker's Manual|accessdate=December 29, 2009|publisher=Imax|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229035233/http://www.imax.com/images/corporate/pdfs/filmmaker.pdf|archivedate=December 29, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In July 2008, the company introduced a digital projection system, which it has not given a distinct name or brand, designed for multiplex theatres with screens no wider than {{convert|21.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Fleet Science Center]]) began searching North America for a large-format film system to project on the dome of their planned {{convert|23.16|m|ft|abbr=on}} tilted [[dome]] [[planetarium]]. The standard IMAX projector was unsuitable for use inside a dome because it had a {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lamp house on top. IMAX Corporation redesigned its system, adding an [[elevator]] to lift the projector to the center of the dome from the projection booth below. Spectra Physics designed a suitable lamphouse that took smaller, {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} lamps and placed the bulb behind the lens instead of above the projector. In 1970,<ref>[http://www.elcan.com/About_ELCAN/History/ Elcan.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317234532/http://www.elcan.com/About_ELCAN/History/ |date=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> Ernst Leitz Canada, Ltd. (now [[ELCAN Optical Technologies]]) won a contract to develop and manufacture a [[fisheye lens]] projection system optimized to project an image onto a dome instead of a flat screen.\n\nThe dome system, which the San Diego Hall of Science called \"Omnimax\", uses films shot with a camera equipped with a [[fisheye lens]] that squeezes a highly-distorted [[anamorphic]] 180\u00b0 field of view onto the 65&nbsp;mm IMAX film. The lens is aligned below the center of the frame, and most of the bottom half of the circular field falls beyond the edge of the film. The part of the field that would fall below the edge of the dome is masked. When filming, the camera is aimed upward at an angle that matches the tilt of the dome. When projected through a matching fisheye lens onto a dome, the original panoramic view is recreated. Omnimax wraps 180\u00b0 horizontally, 100\u00b0 above the horizon and 22\u00b0 below the horizon for a viewer at the center of the dome. Omnimax premiered in 1973, showing ''[[Voyage to the Outer Planets]]'' (produced by Graphic Films) and ''[[Garden Isle]]'' (by Roger Tilton Films) on a double bill. IMAX has since renamed the system \"IMAX Dome\", but some theaters (primarily those opened before the 2000s) continue to call it \"Omnimax\".\n\nIMAX Dome theatres are used in theme parks and many North American museums, particularly those with a scientific focus, where the technical aspects of the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction. The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing of the equipment in operation, and it is often accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits. For some theaters, before the show begins, the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it.\n\nThe screen may be a permanent fixture, such as at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] ([[Henry Crown Space Center]]) in Chicago, Illinois; the [[Fort Worth Museum of Science and History]]; the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the [[St. Louis Science Center]]; [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston's Museum of Science]]; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond's]] [[Science Museum of Virginia]]; the Charlotte Observer IMAX Dome Theatre at [[Discovery Place]], Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama's [[McWane Science Center]]; [[US Space and Rocket Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama; the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal]] and [[Great Lakes Science Center]] in Cleveland, Ohio, and the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nAlternatively, the dome may be lowered and raised as needed, such as the former installation at the [[Canadian Museum of History]] (where it shared an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen, all replaced with a [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] CINE+ digital theatre system in 2016).<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/history-museum-theatre-upgrades-into-the-future |title=History Museum theatre upgrades into the future |last=Cox |first=Aidan |date=February 29, 2016 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> The entire dome could be raised to show flat screen features, and repositioned for immersive features.\n\nWhile the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films, on special occasions entertainment films are also shown, such as ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' at the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]]. The largest screens in North America are at [[Liberty Science Center]] in Jersey City, New Jersey, and the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Science World]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, both of which have dome screens {{convert|27|m|ft}} in size.\n\nDue to the age of the IMAX Dome format as well as its entirely analogue nature, some theatres may opt to replace their existing IMAX Dome systems with newer, more versatile digital systems. Examples of former IMAX Dome theatres that have had their IMAX equipment replaced with newer equipment include [[Tietomaa|Tietomaa Science Centre]] in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]] (which replaced its IMAX 8/70 equipment from 1988 with a Barco DP4K-32B [[4K resolution|4K]] projection system in 2013),<ref>https://www.ouka.fi/oulu/kulttuuri-ja-kirjastot/ajankohtaista/-/asset_publisher/2fVr/content/tietomaan-jattielokuvateatteri-digiaikaan</ref> the [[Omni-Theatre, Science Centre Singapore|Omni-Theatre at]] [[Science Centre Singapore]]<ref>https://www.es.com/news/clients/2015-07_Singapore.aspx</ref>, the [[National Museum of Natural Science]]<ref>https://www.es.com/news/clients/2015-07_Taiwan.aspx</ref> in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]] (which both had their original IMAX Dome 1570 projection systems installed respectively in 1987 and 1985 replaced with [[Evans & Sutherland]] [[Digistar|Digistar 5]] [[8K resolution|8K]] digital systems in 2015), and the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at [[Liberty Science Center]] in [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], which replaced its IMAX Dome 1570 projection system from 1993 (when built was the largest IMAX Dome/OMNIMAX theatre in the world) with an Evans & Sutherland Digistar 6 \"True8K\" digital system in 2017.<ref>https://www.es.com/news/clients/2017-04_LibertyScienceCenter.aspx</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, the Hackworth IMAX dome in The Tech Museum (now [[The Tech Interactive]]) replaced its 70mm IMAX projector with a 4K IMAX Laser projector. It became the first digital IMAX Laser dome theater in the world. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== {{anchor|IMAX 3D}} 3D ===\n{{further|3D film}}\nTo create the illusion of depth, the IMAX [[Stereoscopy|3D]] process uses two separate camera lenses that represent the left and right eyes. The lenses are separated by a distance of {{convert|64|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the average distance between a human's eyes. Two separate rolls of film are used to capture the images they produce. The IMAX 3D camera weighs over {{convert|113|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. By projecting the two films superimposed on the screen and using one of several available methods to direct only the correct image to each eye, viewers see a 3D image on a 2D screen. One method is to use [[polarizer|polarizing filters]] to oppositely [[linear polarization|polarize]] the light used in projecting each image. The viewer wears glasses with polarizing filters oriented to match the projector filters, so that the filter over each eye blocks the light used to project the images intended for the other eye. In another method, the two projections rapidly alternate. While one image is being shown, the projection of its mate is blocked. Each [[film frame|frame]] is shown more than once to increase the rate and suppress flicker. The viewer wears [[Active shutter 3D system|shutter glasses]] with [[liquid crystal display|liquid crystal]]<!-- unfortunately, the \"liquid crystal\" article is dauntingly technical --> shutters that block or transmit light [[synchronization|in sync]] with the projectors, so each eye sees only the images meant for it.\n\nSeveral of the early films that had been produced in [[digital 3D]] for release in conventional theaters<!-- the AE spelling appears to predominate in this article --> were also presented in IMAX 3D, including ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. The first full-color IMAX 3D film was the 1986 short documentary ''[[Transitions (film)|Transitions]]'', produced for [[Expo 86]] in Vancouver.<ref name=\"Aitken\">{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=Ian|title=Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdSNAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169&dq=%22Encyclopedia+of+the+Documentary+Film%22+IMAX&hl=en&sa=X&ei=a8-CVYS9Icbm-AHTqIDYCw&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Encyclopedia%20of%20the%20Documentary%20Film%22%20IMAX&f=false|date=October 27, 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1579584450|pages=168\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===HD===\nVariations on IMAX included the [[High Frame Rate|48 frames per second]] IMAX HD process, which sought to produce smoother, more lifelike motion, while also reducing the blurring of moving objects, by doubling the normal film rate. The IMAX HD system was tested in 1992 at the Canada Pavilion of the [[Seville Expo '92]] with the film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]''.<ref name=\"NFB Seville\">{{cite web | url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2010/07/23/the-nfb-and-world-fairs-pt-4-seville-and-expo-92/ | title=The NFB and World Fairs, pt. 4: Seville and Expo 92 | publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]] | work=NFB.ca Blog | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=June 12, 2012 | author=St-Pierre, Marc}}</ref> Higher production costs, and the high \"wear-and-tear\" on the prints and projectors, doomed the IMAX HD system, but, not before many theatres had been retrofitted to project at 48 frames, especially in Canada, in order to play ''Momentum''. In the 1990s theme parks in Thailand, Germany, and Las Vegas used IMAX HD for their Motion Simulator rides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Imax-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=IMAX Corporation \u2013 Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> The Disney parks attraction [[Soarin' Over California]] features a modification of both IMAX HD and IMAX Dome, projecting in 48 frames per second.\n\n=== Digital ===\nBecause 70mm film and projectors are costly and difficult to mass produce, and because the size of auditoriums that house full-size IMAX screens make them expensive to construct, IMAX debuted a digital projection system in 2008 to use with shorter 1.90:1 aspect ratio screens. It uses two 2K-resolution projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). The digital installations have caused some controversy, as many theaters have branded their screens as IMAX after merely retrofitting standard auditoriums with IMAX digital projectors. The screen sizes in these auditoriums are much smaller than those in the purpose-built auditoriums of the original 15/70 IMAX format, and are limited to the 1.90:1 aspect ratio. Another disadvantage is the much lower resolution of digital IMAX. The technology has a maximum perceived resolution of 2.9K, compared to traditional IMAX 70mm projection, which has an estimated resolution of 12K.<ref name=\"imaxresolution\" /><ref name=\"IMAX Digital - Slater\" /><ref name=atlasomega>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasomega.com/2010/08/howard-hall-interview/|title=Interview with Underwater Filmmaker Howard Hall|first=Calvin|last=Tang|work=AtlasOmega|publisher=AtlasOmega Media, LLC|date=15 August 2010|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref> Some reviewers have also noted that many non-IMAX theaters are projecting films at [[4K resolution]] through competing brands such as [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[Cineplex Entertainment#Premium screens|UltraAVX]].\n\nIMAX has held to a uniform branding of \"The IMAX Experience\" across various underlying technologies and screen sizes.<ref name=\"lfexaminer.com\">Hyder, James (October 16, 2008).

The expense and logistical challenges of producing and presenting IMAX films have led to approximately 40 minute shorter running times than conventional films. Most are documentaries suited for institutional venues such as museums and [[science museum|science centers]]. IMAX cameras have been used while orbiting the Earth, climbing [[Mount Everest]], exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and visiting the [[Antarctic]]. A film about the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], titled ''[[Roving Mars]]'' (2006), used exclusive data{{clarify|date=December 2015}} from the rovers.<ref name=\"IMAX\"/>\n\nAn early attempt at presenting mainstream entertainment in IMAX format was ''[[Stones at the Max|The Rolling Stones: Live at the Max]]'' (1991), an 85-minute compilation of concert footage filmed in IMAX during the rock band's [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|1990 Steel Wheels tour]], edited to give the impression of a single concert. In the 1990s, more entertainment short films were created, notably ''[[T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]'' in 1998, and ''[[Haunted Castle (2001 film)|Haunted Castle]]'' in 2001 (both in 3D). In 1995, French director [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] directed ''[[Wings of Courage]]'', the first dramatic picture shot for IMAX. In 1998 and 1999, ''[[More (1998 film)|More]]'' and ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1999 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'' became the first short films produced using the IMAX format; both earned Academy Award nominations, with ''Old Man and the Sea'' becoming the only IMAX film to win an Oscar. In 2000, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] produced ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', the first full-length animated feature initially released exclusively in the IMAX format.\n\n=== Use in Hollywood productions ===\nBefore the end of the 1990s, theatrical features were deemed impossible to run in IMAX venues at the time, as there was a technical limitation on the size of the film reel where films had to run around two hours. Originally, IMAX and [[Pixar]] considered releasing ''[[Toy Story]]'' in IMAX 3D, but test results showed that the render resolution could not match the size of the IMAX image.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imax.com/community/blog/close-call/ |title=BLOG @ IMAX: Close Call |publisher=Imax.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030092740/http://www.imax.com/community/blog/close-call/ |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in the early 2000s wanted to re-release ''[[Shrek]]'' in IMAX 3D, but this too was canceled as a result of creative changes in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|author=Studio Briefing |url=http://culture.com/news/item/1423/as-expected-imax-reports-a-loss.phtml |title=As Expected, IMAX Reports A Loss |publisher=Culture.com |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> These failed attempts at re-releases did inspire IMAX to experiment and improve their ability in presenting computer animation in their theaters. Their compilation ''[[CyberWorld]]'' was the result, which contained new original animation and IMAX-presented versions of computer animated tests and music videos. ''Cyberworld'' even presented [[open matte|open-matte]] 3D versions of the bar sequence from ''[[Antz]]'' and the \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI|Homer3]]\" segment from ''[[The Simpsons]]''; both coincidentally were animated at [[Pacific Data Images]].\n\n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] became the first studio to release theatrical films in the IMAX process. Released on New Year's Day in 2000, ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' was the studio's first IMAX release and the first theatrical feature presented in IMAX theaters. It was originally planned as a standard theatrical release, but in agreeing with the company to release the film, the IMAX sound system incorporated a multi-channel and multi-layer stereo system for the orchestrated soundtrack, similar to the [[Fantasound]] system Walt Disney had envisioned for the [[Fantasia (1940 film)|original film]] in 1940. The company agreed to Disney's terms and conditions to gain the exclusive first showings of the film. These included a limited engagement of four months (from January 1 to April 30) and 50% of the box office receipts. Not all IMAX cinemas were prepared to accept Disney's terms to present the film; however, following the IMAX release, a standard 35mm run followed in June at regular theaters.\n\nAlthough ''Fantasia 2000'' had a lukewarm financial run, the critical praise for its use of the IMAX format convinced Disney to put more releases in the giant-screen format in the pipeline. In 2002, IMAX re-issues of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]'' were released in select theaters over the winter and Christmas seasons of that year. New [[digital master]]s were created from the original [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] production files and select scenes of animation were cleaned up to make use of the high resolution IMAX film negatives. ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' was also released in select IMAX theaters and was the first theatrical film released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously. But all of these releases had underwhelming box office returns and Disney canceled later big-screen re-releases, including ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.\n\nWith the unveiling of the DMR process (see below), [[Warner Brothers|Warner Bros. Pictures]] especially embraced the format beginning in 2003 with the two ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded|Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions|Revolutions]]''. Since ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|The Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004, Warner Bros. began releasing [[Harry Potter (film series)|the Harry Potter film franchise]] in IMAX to strong financial success. Also in 2004 the studio released [[Robert Zemeckis]]' motion-capture film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' in IMAX 3D. ''Polar Express'' became the most successful film released in IMAX theaters, producing at least a quarter of the film's gross of $302 million from fewer than 100 IMAX screens.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Success for Warner Bros. and IMAX followed in later years with ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'', ''[[Happy Feet]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. Progressively other studios became further interested in releasing films in IMAX through the DMR process and have earned success through it. In May 2009, [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' was released in IMAX venues for the initial two weeks of its theatrical run and opened to $8.3 million dollars.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003418.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title='Star Trek' beams up $76.5 million |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |work=Variety |date=May 10, 2009}}</ref> The IMAX opening weekends of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2]]'' have since grossed $15 million.\n\nThough they were not filmed with IMAX cameras, ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' were optimized for IMAX digital screens when they were released. Both movies were filmed in high-resolution cameras and the digital negative ratio was equal to that of the IMAX Digital frame. ''Skyfall'' increased the visual information of the entire film while ''Amazing Spider-Man'' optimized the finale battle with the Lizard. When [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' was restored and re-released in theaters there was also specially made an open-matte version for IMAX. In 2010 after years of successful IMAX DMR releases, Warner Bros. signed a deal to release up to 20 feature films in IMAX up to 2013, including educational documentaries that were in production.<ref>{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/money/2010/04/28/13751681.html |title=IMAX inks 20-film deal with Warner Bros. |work=Toronto Sun |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, [[Marvel Studios]] announced that its next two ''Avengers'' films \u2014 ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) \u2014 would be filmed entirely in IMAX, the first Hollywood feature films to do so, using a modified version of [[Arri]]'s Alexa 65 digital camera.

This special [[digital intermediate]] technology let IMAX venues show films shot on 35mm for conventional theaters. In 2002, ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' and an IMAX-format re-release of the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', were the first official applications of the DMR process. Because of projection limitations at the time, the studios had to edit ''Apollo 13'' and ''Attack of the Clones'' to have a shorter playing time. As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters, the later DMR releases did not have this limitation; current platters provide a run time of up to 175 minutes. Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process, which are visually and audibly superior to the same films projected in 35mm.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} But some filmmakers, such as producer [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], point out that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the 70&nbsp;mm 15 perf IMAX format, and that directors [[Ron Howard]] and [[George Lucas]] expected better.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2004/lfca/index.htm |title=Change Comes To LFCA. 2004 LFCA |publisher=In70mm.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> They note that the decline of [[Cinerama]] coincided roughly with its replacement by a simpler, cheaper, technically inferior version, and view DMR with alarm. IMAX originally reserved the phrase \"the IMAX experience\" for true 70&nbsp;mm productions, but now allows its use on DMR productions as well.\n\nAfter ''The Lion King'' in 2003, no Hollywood studio engaged in re-releasing and restoring classic films through the IMAX DMR process until 2012 although ongoing conversion of new releases continued and continued to grow in number. James Cameron's ''Titanic'' underwent both 3D conversion and DMR conversion to 3D in 2012 as did ''Men in Black 3''. In August 2012 IMAX and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced a one-week exclusive re-release of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' on September 7, 2012, to promote the release of the Blu-Ray collection. The film, before it underwent DMR, was already restored in a 4K digital intermediate with 7.1 surround sound from the original negative. The process for IMAX theaters, like with the complete restoration, was supervised by [[Steven Spielberg]] and sound designer [[Ben Burtt]]. \"I didn't know if the 1981 print would stand up to a full IMAX transfer, so I came expecting a sort of grainy, muddy, and overly enlarged representation of the movie I had made years ago\", Spielberg said. \"I was blown away by the fact that it looked better than the movie I had made years ago.\"\n\n===Feature films===\n[[File:Christopher Nolan, London, 2013 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Nolan]] has been a vocal supporter of the IMAX 70 mm film format, and has collaborated with the company since the mid-2000s.<ref name=NolanIMAX>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/features/christopher-nolan-emma-thomas-wow-moments-filming-in-imax-1202721099/|title=Christopher Nolan, Emma Thomas on 'Wow Moments' Filming in Imax|first=Nick|last=Clement|date=March 8, 2018|work=Variety|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref>]]\nMany recent features have employed IMAX cameras for select scenes, however, before 2018 no full-length feature film was shot entirely using IMAX cameras due to the numerous difficulties presented with the format \u2013 the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras and the noise they produced made dialogue recording difficult.<ref name=\"Slash\">{{cite web|title=How The Dark Knight Went IMAX|publisher=Slash Film|date=June 14, 2008 | url = https://www.slashfilm.com/how-the-dark-knight-went-imax/| accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> The 70mm cameras have short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes<ref name=\"Slash\"/> and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film.<ref name=\"Wrap\">{{cite web|title=3D a 'Flash in the Pan' \u2013 'Inception' Cinematographer|publisher=The Wrap|date=November 12, 2010 | url = https://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/inception-cinematographer-3-d-may-be-flash-pan-22480| accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> However, these issues have been minimized thanks to the digital Arri Alexa IMAX camera, with two films having been shot entirely with the camera.<ref name=infinity>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/avengers-infinity-war-to-be-shot-entirely-with-imax-cameras-1201489782/|title='Avengers: Infinity War' to Be Shot Entirely With Imax Cameras|date=7 May 2015|first=Brent|last=Lang|accessdate=7 March 2016|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' features six sequences (a total of 28 minutes) shot using IMAX.

Pictures press notes, ''The Dark Knight''</ref> Even before ''Dark Knight'', Nolan had wanted to shoot a film in the IMAX format, and he also used it for quiet scenes that it would make pictorially interesting. Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: \"if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie.\" Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative to eliminate generation loss, while scenes that were digitally mastered were scanned and printed out at 8 thousand lines of horizontal resolution (8K).<ref name=fxguide>{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/dark_knight_imax_effects_and_that_bike/|title=Dark Knight : Imax, Effects and That Bike|first=Mike|last=Seymour|date=July 21, 2008|work=fxguide.com|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> When the film opened in 94 IMAX venues in 2008, all of them were sold out for the opening weekend.\n\nA year later, director [[Michael Bay]] was inspired by IMAX's use in ''The Dark Knight'' to feature big-screen sequences in ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive Video: Director Michael Bay talks Transformers Revenge of the Fallen|publisher=Collider|date=February 9, 2009 | url = https://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/10866/tcid/1 | accessdate=April 16, 2010}}</ref> The film's co-writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, but Bay later said that considering himself an \"old school\" filmmaker, he found 3D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras. The IMAX version of the film, in the end, contained almost ten minutes of IMAX-filmed footage out of the two and a half hour film. Bay later partially filmed the third Transformers film, ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' in 3D but without IMAX. Bay returned to IMAX for the fourth film, ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'', in 2014.

In a then-Hollywood record, ''The Dark Knight Rises'' featured 72 minutes of footage shot in 70mm IMAX (roughly 2.5 times that of ''The Dark Knight's'' 28 minutes, however, this record was later overtaken by another Nolan film, ''Dunkirk'', which featured 79 minutes of IMAX) Because of the considerable noise IMAX cameras make, they used standard 65mm cameras to shoot dialogue scenes, and dubbed dialogue in scenes shot with IMAX cameras.

''Sully'' was filmed with Arri Alexa IMAX cameras for almost the entire film and ''Top Gun: Maverick'' entirely with IMAX-certified [[CineAlta#List of CineAlta cameras|Sony VENICE]] cameras.

However, unlike the previous films, where he used the cameras for select sequences, Nolan used IMAX as the primary shooting format, with 75% (about 79 minutes) of the 106-minute film featuring footage shot in 70mm IMAX (breaking the aforementioned record that a previous Nolan film, ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', held). This was possible due to the sparsity of dialogue in the film, as 15/70mm IMAX cameras are notoriously noisy (a few dialogue-heavy scenes were shot with regular 70mm film cameras). IMAX cameras were also used hand-held for the first time, as Nolan was advised by both [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Ron Howard]] that it was the best way to shoot on vessels. ''Dunkirk'' received the widest release on 70mm IMAX since his last film, ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', with the film being released on the format in 37 theaters around the world.

There are two lines to the system: [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]] and [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]]  The system is under the jurisdiction of the [[Light Rail Transit Authority]], although the [[Light Rail Manila Corporation]] is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Line 1.\n\nAlthough the system is referred to as a \"[[light rail]]\" system, arguably because the network is mostly elevated, the system is more akin to a [[rapid transit]] (metro) system in European-North American terms. The Manila LRT system is the first metro system in [[Southeast Asia]], earlier than the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore MRT]] by three years.<ref name=\"CTRT2\">{{cite web|url=http://cityrailtransit.com/timeline/manila_timeline.htm|title=Manila Timeline|website=cityrailtransit.com}}</ref>\n\nIts 31 stations along over {{convert|31|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=}} of mostly elevated track form two lines. Line&nbsp;1, opened in 1984, travels a north\u2013south route. Line 2, opened in 2003, travels along an east\u2013west route. All of the stations of Lines 1 and 2 are elevated, except for the [[Katipunan station]] (which is underground).<ref name=\"gabay2\">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/citizenscharter/Mga%20Gabay%20sa%20Pasaherong%20Sasakay%20ng%20LRT.pdf ''Mga Gabay sa Pasaherong Sasakay ng LRT''] [Tips for Passengers Riding the LRT].

It originally began as a single line ([[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]]) that was first opened in 1999 and became fully operational by the year 2000. The MRT branding is currently associated with rapid transit lines in Metro Manila not under the jurisdiction of the LRTA, including Line 7 and Line 9, although the three lines will have different operators.\n\nThe system currently has 13 stations along {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=}} of mostly elevated track in an orbital north-south route. Line 3, the first line in the system, opened in 1999. Two more lines, Line 7 and Line 9, are slated to open in 2021 and 2022 respectively, although Line 9 will only be partially operational by then; the line is planned to be fully operational by 2025.\n\n== Operators ==\n\n===Philippine National Railways===\n{{Main|Philippine National Railways}}\nThe Philippine National Railways (PNR) is a [[Government-owned and controlled corporation|state-owned]] [[railway company]].

The term ''phalloplasty'' is also occasionally used to refer to [[penis enlargement]].\n\nThe first phalloplasty done for the purposes of [[sexual reassignment]] was performed on [[Michael Dillon]], a [[trans man]], in 1946 by Dr. [[Harold Gillies]], which is documented in [[Pagan Kennedy]]'s book ''The First Man-Made Man''.\n\n==History==\nThe Russian surgeon Nikolaj Bogoraz performed the first reconstruction of a total penis using rib cartilage in a reconstructed phallus made from a tubed abdominal flap in 1936.<ref name=\"pmid24501465\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Rashid M, Tamimy MS | title=Phalloplasty: The dream and the reality. | journal=Indian J Plast Surg | year= 2013 | volume= 46 | issue= 2 | pages= 283\u201393 | pmid=24501465 | doi=10.4103/0970-0358.118606 | pmc=3901910  }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24830674\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Segal RL, Camper SB, Burnett AL | title=Modern utilization of penile prosthesis surgery: a national claim registry analysis. | journal=Int J Impot Res | year= 2014 | volume= 26 | issue= 5 | pages= 167\u201371 | pmid=24830674 | doi=10.1038/ijir.2014.11 | pmc= | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/833169  }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid16422917\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Schultheiss D, Gabouev AI, Jonas U | title=Nikolaj A.

Later improvements in [[microsurgery]] made more techniques available.\n\n==Indications==\nA complete construction or reconstruction of a penis can be performed on patients who:\n* Have congenital anomalies such as [[micropenis]], [[epispadias]], and [[hypospadias]]\n* Have lost their penis\n* Are [[trans men]] who desire [[sex reassignment surgery]] as part of their [[gender transition]].\n\n==Techniques and related procedures==\nThere are different techniques for phalloplasty. Construction of a new penis (sometimes called a neophallus) typically involves taking a tissue flap from a donor site (such as the forearm). Extending the [[urethra]] through the length of the neophallus is another goal of phalloplasty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Shane D.|last2=Shakir|first2=Afaaf|last3=Vyas|first3=Krishna S.|last4=Kirby|first4=Johanna|last5=Crane|first5=Curtis N.|last6=Lee|first6=Gordon K.|date=September 2016|title=Phalloplasty: A Review of Techniques and Outcomes|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=138|issue=3|pages=594\u2013615|doi=10.1097/PRS.0000000000002518|pmid=27556603|issn=0032-1052}}</ref>\n\nSurgery for cisgender males is simpler than for female-to-male transgender patients, because the urethra requires less lengthening. The urethra of a trans man ends near the vaginal opening and has to be lengthened considerably. The lengthening of the urethra is where most complications occur.\n\nWith all types of phalloplasty in trans men, [[scrotoplasty]] can be performed using the labia majora ([[vulva]]) to form a [[scrotum]] where prosthetic testicles can be inserted. If [[vaginectomy]], [[hysterectomy]] and/or [[oophorectomy]] have not been performed, they can be done at the same time.\n\nUnlike [[metoidioplasty]], phalloplasty requires an implanted erectile prosthesis to achieve an erection. This is usually done in a separate surgery to allow time for healing. There are several types of erectile prostheses, including malleable rod-like medical devices that allow the neo-penis to either stand up or hang down. Penile implants require a neophallus of appropriate length and volume in order to be a safe option. The long term success rates of implants in constructed penises are lower than the success rates of reconstruction in people born with penises. Good sensation in the reconstructed penis can help reduce the risk of the implant eventually eroding through the skin.<ref>[http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2809%2900245-0/fulltext \"Erectile Implants in Female-to-Male Transsexuals: Our Experience in 129 Patients\" by Piet B. Hoebeke, Karel Decaestecker, Matthias Beysens, Yasmin Opdenakker, Nicolaas Lumen and Stan M. Monstrey, ''European Urology'', February 2010]</ref>\n\nEarlier techniques used a bone graft as part of reconstruction. Long-term follow-up studies from Germany and Turkey of more than 10 years proved that these reconstructions maintain their stiffness without later complications. Unfortunately, the reconstructed penis cannot become flaccid again without breaking the internal bone graft.\n\nTemporary lengthening can also be gained by a procedure that releases the suspensory ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone, thereby allowing the penis to be advanced toward the outside of the body. The procedure is performed through a discreet horizontal incision located in the pubic region where the pubic hair will help conceal the incision site. However, scar formation can cause the penis to retract. Therefore, the [[American Urological Association]] \"considers the division of the suspensory ligament of the penis for increasing penile length in adults to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/penile-augmentation-surgery|title=American Urological Association - Penile Augmentation Surgery|website=www.auanet.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2009, there is research in progress to synthesize ''corpora cavernosa'' (erectile tissue) in the lab on rabbits for eventual use in patients requiring penile construction surgery. Of the rabbits used in the preliminary studies, 8 of 12 had biological responses to sexual stimuli that was similar to the control, and four caused impregnation.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/12/0909367106.full \"Bioengineered corporal tissue for structural and functional restoration of the penis\" by Kuo-Liang Chen, Daniel Eberli, James J. Yoo, and Anthony Atala (''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Vol. 106 No. 45, November 9, 2009)]</ref>\n\n==Explanation of techniques==\n\n===Flap from the arm===\nAn operation using the forearm as a donor site is the easiest to perform but results in a cosmetically undesirable scar on the exposed area of the arm. Arm function may be hampered if the donor site does not heal properly. Electrolysis and/or laser hair reduction is required for a relatively hairless neophallus.\n\nSometimes a full-scale [[metoidioplasty]] is done a few months before the actual phalloplasty to reduce the possibility of complications after phalloplasty. Sensation is retained through the [[clitoris|clitoral tissue]] at the base of the neophallus, and surgeons will often attempt to connect nerves together from the clitoris or nearby. Nerves from the flap and the tissue it has been attached to may eventually connect. This ''does not'' necessarily guarantee the ability to achieve genital orgasm after healing, as the most important task of nerve reconnection is to ensure the penis is able to sense injury, but it is rare to lose the ability to orgasm.\n\nThe following explanation of this technique has many similarities to other approaches, but the construction of the glans differs.\n* The surgery starts (after the patient is prepped) with the forearm marked for graft size. After the graft is taken, another graft will be used to cover the arm (resulting in a secondary scar).\n* The graft is dissected to expose the veins and ''antebrachial cutaneous'' nerves. (the latter done carefully for later reattachment)\n* If the urethra is being constructed at the same time as the phallus, it is joined at this step. If not, the glans is shaped. Sometimes ''glansplasty'' is done in a separate surgical stage after urethral extension.\n* A segment of vein going to the patient's groin is \"borrowed\" to allow easier joining of the graft with the preexisting tissues.\n* The vein is carefully attached to the ''femoral artery''.\n* The blood supplies from the graft and the vein leading to the [[femoral artery]] are joined.\n* The clitoral hood and ligament is cut away, and the nerve bundle is isolated for the time being. While this assumes the clitoral tissue is assimilated (buried) into the penis base, some surgeons give the option of leaving it as-is in a post [[metoidioplasty]] like state.\n* The flap is partially attached physically while the surgeon attempts to join the nerve bundles.\n* If the urethra was extended, it is now joined with a catheter that will remain in place for healing purposes for two to four weeks. Otherwise, the skin is sutured up and/or the scrotum is [[Scrotoplasty|fabricated]].\n[[File:Penis post-operative of transgender phalloplasty.jpg|thumb|Example of completed radial forearm flap phalloplasty with no urethra extension.]]\n\nIf the patient chooses to have the urethra extended to the glans of the neophallus, it is formed by the following steps:\n* The labia minora is injected with a mixture of saline and epinephrine.\n* It is then split open and layers separated using sharp and blunt dissection.\n* The layers are wrapped around a catheter and stitched.\n* A mucosal flap from the vagina may be used to bridge the urethra with the extension. This is often done in a separate procedure. Alternative graft locations include the mouth/cheeks or experimentally, the intestines. If the labia minora is not used during construction of the urethral extension, (or in the chance there is enough material remaining) it can be used during glansplasty to provide for better results compared with a full thickness skin graft.\n\n===Flap from the side of the chest===\nA relatively new technique involving a flap from the side of the chest under the armpit (known as a ''musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi'' free transfer flap) is a step forward in phalloplasty. The advantages of this technique over the older forearm flap technique include:\n* Hairlessness (little to no electrolysis needed)\n* Aesthetic appearance of normally colored skin (the glans may be tattooed to proper color)\n* Capable of tactile sensation (as with any form of phalloplasty, this does not necessarily mean the ability to have a genital orgasm after healing, as the erogenous zone is limited to the base of the penis)\n* Leaves an inconspicuous scar\n* Has a lower occurrence of complications from both the initial surgery and the erectile prosthesis insertion\n\nThe disadvantages include:\n* Uses a motor nerve so erogenous sensation cannot be achieved, only tactile sensation.\n* It can pull the nipple to the side causing it to be off the usual location.\nThis is a three-part surgery that takes place over a period of six to nine months. The steps consist of:\n\nNeophallus creation using MLD free flap\n* The surgery starts (after the patient is prepped) with the side of the chest marked for flap size.\n* The flap is dissected to expose the veins and the ''thoracodorsal'' nerves.\n* The flap, while still attached to the blood supply, is formed to a rough phallus shape by rolling the edges together.\n* A segment of vein going to the patient's groin is \"borrowed\" to allow easier joining of the flap with the preexisting tissues.\n* The vein is carefully attached to the ''femoral artery''.\n* The blood supplies from the flap and the vein leading to the femoral artery are joined.\n* The clitoral hood and ligament are cut away and the nerve bundle is isolated.\n* The flap is partially attached physically while the surgeon attempts to join the nerve bundles.\n\nDuring initial recovery, the neophallus is protected from contact with other tissues with a specially constructed dressing as to avoid blood supply complications.\n\nAfter three months, urethroplasty (urethral extension) is performed.\n* The neophallus is dissected and a buccal (oral) mucosa graft inlaid into the created cavity and extended to the native urethra and joined to permanently allow urination while standing\n* A catheter is placed for several weeks to allow for proper healing\n\nAfter another three to six months, a device that allows an erection can be inserted.\n\n===Flap from the leg===\n[[File:Phalloplasty-Artificial male genitals on grey background.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of stage 1 [[Sex reassignment surgery (female-to-male)|female-to-male sex reassignment]] prior to glansplasty penis with tissue grafting scar on the left hip]]\nThe lower leg operation is similar to forearm flap with the exception that the donor scar is easily covered with a sock and/or pants and hidden from view. Other details are same as forearm flap, especially the need for permanent hair removal before the operation. A flap from the leg or another area where the scar is less noticeable may be combined with free forearm flap to create the urethral lengthening or to sculpt the glans penis.\n\n===Pubic area flap===\nThe flap location is around the pelvic bone, usually running across the abdomen under the belly button. As such, there is a large horizontal scar that may not be aesthetically acceptable. The flap has a less natural appearance and may not maintain an erectile implant long term. Electrolysis is required before surgery with the alternative being clearing of hair via shaving, or chemical depilatory.\n\n===Gillies technique===\nThis technique was pioneered by Sir Harold Delf Gillies as one of the first competent phalloplasty techniques. It was simply a flap of abdominal skin rolled into a tube to simulate a penis, with urethral extension being another section of skin to create a \"tube within a tube.\" Early erectile implants consisted of a flexible rod. A later improvement involved the inclusion of a blood supply pedicle which was left in place to prevent tissue death before it was transplanted to the groin. Most latter techniques involve tissues with attached pedicle.\n\n===Abdominal muscle===\nSkin grafted muscle flaps have fallen from popularity. This procedure is a minimum of 3 steps and involves implantation of an expansion balloon to facilitate the amount of skin needed for grafting. The grafts have a less natural appearance and are less likely to maintain an erectile implant long term.\n\n===Subcutaneous soft silicone implant===\nThis phalloplasty procedure involves the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone implant under the penile skin.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Shortened penis post penile prosthesis implantation treated with subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant: case report|journal=International Journal of Impotence Research|volume=26|issue=3|pages=100\u2013104|doi=10.1038/ijir.2013.44|pmid=24305609|year=2014|last1=Shirvanian|first1=V.|last2=Lemperle|first2=G.|last3=Araujo Pinto|first3=C.|last4=Elist|first4=J.

During this time, the patient scrubs their lower abdomen and genitals daily with [[chlorhexidine]] soap. On the day of the surgery, [[Vancomycin]] and [[Gentamicin]] are administered intravenously one to two hours prior to the procedure. The lower abdomen and genitals are shaved, scrubbed for five minutes with a Chlorhexidine sponge and prepped with Chorhexidine/Alcohol applicator. The area is then draped with a surgical drape and a Vi Drape over the genitalia. Before the incision is made, a Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder through the urethra.\n\nA 3-cm scrotal incision is made on the penoscrotal raphe and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue to the [[Buck's fascia]]. A Scott retractor, a flexible device that holds open the skin of the surgical site, is applied to the area.\n\nUp until this stage of the surgery, the process has been consistent with the sanitary practices associated with standard surgical sterility.<ref>Richard Pearcy & Raj Persad, publication date unknown, \"Inflatable penile prosthesis,\" in BJU International Website Atlas of Surgery and Surgical Devices, see [http://www.bjui.org/%5CBJUI_IMAGES%5CSurgicalAtlas%5C234Inflatable%20www%20MD%20formatted.pdf], accessed 31 May 2014</ref> At this stage of the \"No-Touch\" Technique, after the incision has been made, all instruments, including surgical gloves that have touched skin are  discarded. A loose drape is then deployed over the entire surgical field and secured at the periphery with adhesive strips. A small opening in the drape is then made overlying the incision and yellow hooks utilized  to secure the edges of the opening to the edges of the incision, completely covering and isolating the patient's skin.  At this point new instruments and equipment are replaced and the entire prosthesis is inserted through the small opening of the loose drape. The loose drape allows for manipulation of the penis and scrotum required for this procedure without touching the skin.\n\nImplantation of the device continues with an incision and dilation of corpora, sizing and placing the penile cylinders, and placement of the pump in the scrotum and the reservoir in the retropubic space.  Saline is used throughout the implantation for irrigation. Once the corporotomies are closed and all of the tubing and components of the prosthesis covered with a layer of Buck's fascia, subcutaneous tissues are closed and the \"No-Touch\" drape is removed and skin closed.<ref name=\"Eid 2011 5-8\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Implants ==\n\n# non inflatable penile implant\n# 2 piece inflatable penile implant\n# 3 piece inflatable penile implant\n\n===Future===\nIn the future, [[bioengineering]] may be used to create fully functional penises.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chen KL, Eberli D, Yoo JJ, Atala A |title=Regenerative Medicine Special Feature: Bioengineered corporal tissue for structural and functional restoration of the penis |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 107|issue= 8|pages= 3346\u201350|date=November 2009 |pmid=19915140 |pmc=2840474 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0909367106}}</ref>\n\n==Common complications==\nAs phalloplasty has improved over the decades, the risks and complications from surgery have been reduced.

Later improvements in [[microsurgery]] made more techniques available.\n\n==Indications==\nA complete construction or reconstruction of a penis can be performed on patients who:\n* Have congenital anomalies such as [[micropenis]], [[epispadias]], and [[hypospadias]]\n* Have lost their penis\n* Are [[trans men]] who desire [[sex reassignment surgery]] as part of their [[gender transition]].\n\n==Techniques and related procedures==\nThere are different techniques for phalloplasty. Construction of a new penis (sometimes called a neophallus) typically involves taking a tissue flap from a donor site (such as the forearm). Extending the [[urethra]] through the length of the neophallus is another goal of phalloplasty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Shane D.|last2=Shakir|first2=Afaaf|last3=Vyas|first3=Krishna S.|last4=Kirby|first4=Johanna|last5=Crane|first5=Curtis N.|last6=Lee|first6=Gordon K.|date=September 2016|title=Phalloplasty: A Review of Techniques and Outcomes|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=138|issue=3|pages=594\u2013615|doi=10.1097/PRS.0000000000002518|pmid=27556603|issn=0032-1052}}</ref>\n\nSurgery for cisgender males is simpler than for female-to-male transgender patients, because the urethra requires less lengthening. The urethra of a trans man ends near the vaginal opening and has to be lengthened considerably. The lengthening of the urethra is where most complications occur.\n\nWith all types of phalloplasty in trans men, [[scrotoplasty]] can be performed using the labia majora ([[vulva]]) to form a [[scrotum]] where prosthetic testicles can be inserted. If [[vaginectomy]], [[hysterectomy]] and/or [[oophorectomy]] have not been performed, they can be done at the same time.\n\nUnlike [[metoidioplasty]], phalloplasty requires an implanted erectile prosthesis to achieve an erection. This is usually done in a separate surgery to allow time for healing. There are several types of erectile prostheses, including malleable rod-like medical devices that allow the neo-penis to either stand up or hang down. Penile implants require a neophallus of appropriate length and volume in order to be a safe option. The long term success rates of implants in constructed penises are lower than the success rates of reconstruction in people born with penises. Good sensation in the reconstructed penis can help reduce the risk of the implant eventually eroding through the skin.<ref>[http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2809%2900245-0/fulltext \"Erectile Implants in Female-to-Male Transsexuals: Our Experience in 129 Patients\" by Piet B. Hoebeke, Karel Decaestecker, Matthias Beysens, Yasmin Opdenakker, Nicolaas Lumen and Stan M. Monstrey, ''European Urology'', February 2010]</ref>\n\nEarlier techniques used a bone graft as part of reconstruction. Long-term follow-up studies from Germany and Turkey of more than 10 years proved that these reconstructions maintain their stiffness without later complications. Unfortunately, the reconstructed penis cannot become flaccid again without breaking the internal bone graft.\n\nTemporary lengthening can also be gained by a procedure that releases the suspensory ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone, thereby allowing the penis to be advanced toward the outside of the body. The procedure is performed through a discreet horizontal incision located in the pubic region where the pubic hair will help conceal the incision site. However, scar formation can cause the penis to retract. Therefore, the [[American Urological Association]] \"considers the division of the suspensory ligament of the penis for increasing penile length in adults to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/penile-augmentation-surgery|title=American Urological Association - Penile Augmentation Surgery|website=www.auanet.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2009, there is research in progress to synthesize ''corpora cavernosa'' (erectile tissue) in the lab on rabbits for eventual use in patients requiring penile construction surgery. Of the rabbits used in the preliminary studies, 8 of 12 had biological responses to sexual stimuli that was similar to the control, and four caused impregnation.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/12/0909367106.full \"Bioengineered corporal tissue for structural and functional restoration of the penis\" by Kuo-Liang Chen, Daniel Eberli, James J. Yoo, and Anthony Atala (''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Vol. 106 No. 45, November 9, 2009)]</ref>\n\n==Explanation of techniques==\n\n===Flap from the arm===\nAn operation using the forearm as a donor site is the easiest to perform but results in a cosmetically undesirable scar on the exposed area of the arm. Arm function may be hampered if the donor site does not heal properly. Electrolysis and/or laser hair reduction is required for a relatively hairless neophallus.\n\nSometimes a full-scale [[metoidioplasty]] is done a few months before the actual phalloplasty to reduce the possibility of complications after phalloplasty. Sensation is retained through the [[clitoris|clitoral tissue]] at the base of the neophallus, and surgeons will often attempt to connect nerves together from the clitoris or nearby. Nerves from the flap and the tissue it has been attached to may eventually connect. This ''does not'' necessarily guarantee the ability to achieve genital orgasm after healing, as the most important task of nerve reconnection is to ensure the penis is able to sense injury, but it is rare to lose the ability to orgasm.\n\nThe following explanation of this technique has many similarities to other approaches, but the construction of the glans differs.\n* The surgery starts (after the patient is prepped) with the forearm marked for graft size. After the graft is taken, another graft will be used to cover the arm (resulting in a secondary scar).\n* The graft is dissected to expose the veins and ''antebrachial cutaneous'' nerves. (the latter done carefully for later reattachment)\n* If the urethra is being constructed at the same time as the phallus, it is joined at this step. If not, the glans is shaped. Sometimes ''glansplasty'' is done in a separate surgical stage after urethral extension.\n* A segment of vein going to the patient's groin is \"borrowed\" to allow easier joining of the graft with the preexisting tissues.\n* The vein is carefully attached to the ''femoral artery''.\n* The blood supplies from the graft and the vein leading to the [[femoral artery]] are joined.\n* The clitoral hood and ligament is cut away, and the nerve bundle is isolated for the time being. While this assumes the clitoral tissue is assimilated (buried) into the penis base, some surgeons give the option of leaving it as-is in a post [[metoidioplasty]] like state.\n* The flap is partially attached physically while the surgeon attempts to join the nerve bundles.\n* If the urethra was extended, it is now joined with a catheter that will remain in place for healing purposes for two to four weeks. Otherwise, the skin is sutured up and/or the scrotum is [[Scrotoplasty|fabricated]].\n[[File:Penis post-operative of transgender phalloplasty.jpg|thumb|Example of completed radial forearm flap phalloplasty with no urethra extension.]]\n\nIf the patient chooses to have the urethra extended to the glans of the neophallus, it is formed by the following steps:\n* The labia minora is injected with a mixture of saline and epinephrine.\n* It is then split open and layers separated using sharp and blunt dissection.\n* The layers are wrapped around a catheter and stitched.\n* A mucosal flap from the vagina may be used to bridge the urethra with the extension. This is often done in a separate procedure. Alternative graft locations include the mouth/cheeks or experimentally, the intestines. If the labia minora is not used during construction of the urethral extension, (or in the chance there is enough material remaining) it can be used during glansplasty to provide for better results compared with a full thickness skin graft.\n\n===Flap from the side of the chest===\nA relatively new technique involving a flap from the side of the chest under the armpit (known as a ''musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi'' free transfer flap) is a step forward in phalloplasty. The advantages of this technique over the older forearm flap technique include:\n* Hairlessness (little to no electrolysis needed)\n* Aesthetic appearance of normally colored skin (the glans may be tattooed to proper color)\n* Capable of tactile sensation (as with any form of phalloplasty, this does not necessarily mean the ability to have a genital orgasm after healing, as the erogenous zone is limited to the base of the penis)\n* Leaves an inconspicuous scar\n* Has a lower occurrence of complications from both the initial surgery and the erectile prosthesis insertion\n\nThe disadvantages include:\n* Uses a motor nerve so erogenous sensation cannot be achieved, only tactile sensation.\n* It can pull the nipple to the side causing it to be off the usual location.\nThis is a three-part surgery that takes place over a period of six to nine months. The steps consist of:\n\nNeophallus creation using MLD free flap\n* The surgery starts (after the patient is prepped) with the side of the chest marked for flap size.\n* The flap is dissected to expose the veins and the ''thoracodorsal'' nerves.\n* The flap, while still attached to the blood supply, is formed to a rough phallus shape by rolling the edges together.\n* A segment of vein going to the patient's groin is \"borrowed\" to allow easier joining of the flap with the preexisting tissues.\n* The vein is carefully attached to the ''femoral artery''.\n* The blood supplies from the flap and the vein leading to the femoral artery are joined.\n* The clitoral hood and ligament are cut away and the nerve bundle is isolated.\n* The flap is partially attached physically while the surgeon attempts to join the nerve bundles.\n\nDuring initial recovery, the neophallus is protected from contact with other tissues with a specially constructed dressing as to avoid blood supply complications.\n\nAfter three months, urethroplasty (urethral extension) is performed.\n* The neophallus is dissected and a buccal (oral) mucosa graft inlaid into the created cavity and extended to the native urethra and joined to permanently allow urination while standing\n* A catheter is placed for several weeks to allow for proper healing\n\nAfter another three to six months, a device that allows an erection can be inserted.\n\n===Flap from the leg===\n[[File:Phalloplasty-Artificial male genitals on grey background.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of stage 1 [[Sex reassignment surgery (female-to-male)|female-to-male sex reassignment]] prior to glansplasty penis with tissue grafting scar on the left hip]]\nThe lower leg operation is similar to forearm flap with the exception that the donor scar is easily covered with a sock and/or pants and hidden from view. Other details are same as forearm flap, especially the need for permanent hair removal before the operation. A flap from the leg or another area where the scar is less noticeable may be combined with free forearm flap to create the urethral lengthening or to sculpt the glans penis.\n\n===Pubic area flap===\nThe flap location is around the pelvic bone, usually running across the abdomen under the belly button. As such, there is a large horizontal scar that may not be aesthetically acceptable. The flap has a less natural appearance and may not maintain an erectile implant long term. Electrolysis is required before surgery with the alternative being clearing of hair via shaving, or chemical depilatory.\n\n===Gillies technique===\nThis technique was pioneered by Sir Harold Delf Gillies as one of the first competent phalloplasty techniques. It was simply a flap of abdominal skin rolled into a tube to simulate a penis, with urethral extension being another section of skin to create a \"tube within a tube.\" Early erectile implants consisted of a flexible rod. A later improvement involved the inclusion of a blood supply pedicle which was left in place to prevent tissue death before it was transplanted to the groin. Most latter techniques involve tissues with attached pedicle.\n\n===Abdominal muscle===\nSkin grafted muscle flaps have fallen from popularity. This procedure is a minimum of 3 steps and involves implantation of an expansion balloon to facilitate the amount of skin needed for grafting. The grafts have a less natural appearance and are less likely to maintain an erectile implant long term.\n\n===Subcutaneous soft silicone implant===\nThis phalloplasty procedure involves the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone implant under the penile skin.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Shortened penis post penile prosthesis implantation treated with subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant: case report|journal=International Journal of Impotence Research|volume=26|issue=3|pages=100\u2013104|doi=10.1038/ijir.2013.44|pmid=24305609|year=2014|last1=Shirvanian|first1=V.|last2=Lemperle|first2=G.|last3=Araujo Pinto|first3=C.|last4=Elist|first4=J.

During this time, the patient scrubs their lower abdomen and genitals daily with [[chlorhexidine]] soap. On the day of the surgery, [[Vancomycin]] and [[Gentamicin]] are administered intravenously one to two hours prior to the procedure. The lower abdomen and genitals are shaved, scrubbed for five minutes with a Chlorhexidine sponge and prepped with Chorhexidine/Alcohol applicator. The area is then draped with a surgical drape and a Vi Drape over the genitalia. Before the incision is made, a Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder through the urethra.\n\nA 3-cm scrotal incision is made on the penoscrotal raphe and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue to the [[Buck's fascia]]. A Scott retractor, a flexible device that holds open the skin of the surgical site, is applied to the area.\n\nUp until this stage of the surgery, the process has been consistent with the sanitary practices associated with standard surgical sterility.<ref>Richard Pearcy & Raj Persad, publication date unknown, \"Inflatable penile prosthesis,\" in BJU International Website Atlas of Surgery and Surgical Devices, see [http://www.bjui.org/%5CBJUI_IMAGES%5CSurgicalAtlas%5C234Inflatable%20www%20MD%20formatted.pdf], accessed 31 May 2014</ref> At this stage of the \"No-Touch\" Technique, after the incision has been made, all instruments, including surgical gloves that have touched skin are  discarded. A loose drape is then deployed over the entire surgical field and secured at the periphery with adhesive strips. A small opening in the drape is then made overlying the incision and yellow hooks utilized  to secure the edges of the opening to the edges of the incision, completely covering and isolating the patient's skin.  At this point new instruments and equipment are replaced and the entire prosthesis is inserted through the small opening of the loose drape. The loose drape allows for manipulation of the penis and scrotum required for this procedure without touching the skin.\n\nImplantation of the device continues with an incision and dilation of corpora, sizing and placing the penile cylinders, and placement of the pump in the scrotum and the reservoir in the retropubic space.  Saline is used throughout the implantation for irrigation. Once the corporotomies are closed and all of the tubing and components of the prosthesis covered with a layer of Buck's fascia, subcutaneous tissues are closed and the \"No-Touch\" drape is removed and skin closed.<ref name=\"Eid 2011 5-8\" />\n\n===Future===\nIn the future, [[bioengineering]] may be used to create fully functional penises.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chen KL, Eberli D, Yoo JJ, Atala A |title=Regenerative Medicine Special Feature: Bioengineered corporal tissue for structural and functional restoration of the penis |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 107|issue= 8|pages= 3346\u201350|date=November 2009 |pmid=19915140 |pmc=2840474 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0909367106}}</ref>\n\n==Common complications==\nAs phalloplasty has improved over the decades, the risks and complications from surgery have been reduced.

He was old enough to witness charters in 1148, as was his younger brother [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], which suggests he was born c. 1130-1133, as the male age of majority was fifteen. (H.E. Mayer has suggested a limited degree of competence may have been accepted from the age of eight, reducing his age, but the examples given of this are of males of the royal house, whose situation was somewhat different.) He was probably about ten years older than his youngest brother, [[Balian of Ibelin]].\n\nAfter his father Barisan died in 1150, Helvis married the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|Constable of Jerusalem]], [[Manasses of Hierges]], who was one of the strongest supporters of [[Queen Melisende]] in the power struggle against her son [[King Baldwin III]]. Manasses was exiled in 1152 when Baldwin was victorious in this struggle, allowing Hugh to inherit Ramla from his mother. Hugh took part in the [[Siege of Ascalon]] in 1153, and in 1157 was captured in battle at [[Banias]], being released probably the next year. In 1159 he visited the [[Principality of Antioch]] and met with [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], who had arrived to assert his suzerainty over the principality. In 1163 Hugh married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] (1133 &ndash; 1184/1185), [[Lord of Toron|Lady of Toron]], the former wife of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric I]] and mother of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II de Courtenay, Count of Edessa]], by whom he had no issue. It is possible that Agnes had already been betrothed or married to him before 1157, date some say it was the one of the actual marriage but she married Amalric after Hugh was taken prisoner; Amalric was forced to divorce her before becoming King in 1163. \n\nHugh participated Amalric's [[Crusader invasion of Egypt|expedition to Egypt]] in 1167, and was responsible for building a bridge over the [[Nile]].

It was released as the lead single from the record on August 10, 2013. Perry co-wrote the song with [[Bonnie McKee]] and its producers [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]]. It is a [[pop music|pop song]] containing elements of [[arena rock]] and lyrics centering on standing up for oneself and self-empowerment.\n\nTo promote the song, Perry performed under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] at the end of the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], on ''[[The X Factor (Australian TV series)|The X Factor Australia]]'', at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in late October 2013, and on the German TV show ''[[Schlag den Raab]]''. Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi directed the song's music video, which features Perry trying to adapt to the jungle and taming a [[tiger]] after surviving a plane crash. Though the song received generally mixed reviews, it was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe song was a commercial success, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Lebanon, New Zealand, Scotland, Slovenia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. By the end of 2013, \"Roar\" had sold 9.9 million units (combined sales and track-equivalent streams) globally according to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). \"Roar\" has sold over 6 million copies in the US, over 1 million in the UK, and was Australia's best-selling single of 2013 with 560,000 copies sold within the year. When \"Roar\" was certified Diamond by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), Perry became the first artist to have three Diamond certified singles in the country, the other being \"Firework\" and \"Dark Horse\".\n\n==Production and composition==\n{{listen\n | pos          = right\n | filename     = Katy Perry - Roar.ogg\n | title        = \"Roar\"\n | description  = A 23 second sample of \"Roar\", a [[Pop music|pop]] song with influences of rock subgenres that lyrically, revolves around a theme of empowerment.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nThe song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios. \"Roar\" was recorded in four other studios: Luke's in the Boo, Playback Recording Studio and Secret Garden Studios, all located in the state of [[California]], as well as [[MXM Studios]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] Perry co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut.<ref name=\"Notes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Prism |titlelink=Prism (Katy Perry album) |others=[[Katy Perry]] |year=2013 |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |location=[[United States]]}}</ref> All its development took place in March 2013.<ref name=KatyOnPrism>{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Katy |title=Katy Perry - Prism |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCIVlrUWMn8 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106164914/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCIVlrUWMn8 |archivedate=January 6, 2014 }}</ref> McKee told [[MTV]] that \"Roar\" is \"kind of a 'pick yourself up and dust yourself off and keep going', female-empowerment song\" and \"kind of an epiphany song.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Vena, Jocelyn |title=Go Behind Katy Perry's 'Raw And Emotional' Prism Writing Sessions |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1716064/katy-perry-bonnie-mckee-prism.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV]] |accessdate=December 23, 2013 |date=October 23, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205010633/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1716064/katy-perry-bonnie-mckee-prism.jhtml |archivedate=December 5, 2013 }}</ref> Perry said she wrote the song after undergoing therapy, saying she was \"sick of keeping all these feelings inside and not speaking up for myself\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/grammys/news/1001829/behind-the-56th-grammy-awards-song-of-the-year-nominees/ |title=Behind The 56th GRAMMY Awards: Song Of The Year Nominees |publisher=CBS |accessdate=August 30, 2016 |date=January 23, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918134157/http://www.cbs.com/shows/grammys/news/1001829/behind-the-56th-grammy-awards-song-of-the-year-nominees/ |archivedate=September 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMusically, \"Roar\" is a [[pop music|pop song]] that features elements of [[arena rock]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/on-the-charts-katy-perry-and-lady-gaga-singles-duke-it-out-20130821 |title=On the Charts: Katy Perry and Lady Gaga Singles Duke It Out |first=Steve |last=Knopper |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 21, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911050626/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/on-the-charts-katy-perry-and-lady-gaga-singles-duke-it-out-20130821 |archivedate=September 11, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Slate1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/12/katy_perry_new_single_roar_latest_song_is_a_jock_jams_pastiche.html |title=Katy Perry new single \"Roar\": Latest song is a Jock Jams pastiche |first=Forrest |last=Wickman |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=August 12, 2013 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812194011/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/12/katy_perry_new_single_roar_latest_song_is_a_jock_jams_pastiche.html |archivedate=August 12, 2013 }}</ref> Throughout the song, Perry \"flexes diva-like vocals\", singing the lyric \"Hey!\" several times in a way resemblant of [[The Lumineers]].<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite web|first=Caryn |last=Ganz |title=Katy Perry - \"Roar\" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/roar-20130828 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=December 23, 2013 |date=August 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024073826/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/roar-20130828 |archivedate=October 24, 2013 }}</ref> The song's [[instrumentation]] is composed of \"pounding\" pianos and \"booming\" bass drums.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> According to the sheet music published by [[Alfred Music]]. on Musicnotes.com, \"Roar\" is composed in the key of [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] and set in a [[time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time signature]] at a moderate [[tempo]] of 90 [[beats per minute]].

Perry shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes [[selfie|pictures of himself]] and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a [[tiger]] and Perry dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a [[crocodile]] when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a [[tarantula]] crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a [[tiger]] instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be [[fireflies]] which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.\n\n[[File:Katy Perry-Roar video.jpg|thumb|left|Perry in the music video for \"Roar\" dressed as \"Queen of the Jungle\".]]\nPresumably a few days later, Perry has since made friends with a [[monkey]] and uses her [[stiletto heel]] to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a [[banana]], which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, with the help of an [[elephant]] who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Perry helps a [[crocodile]] by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with [[fire]]; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting [[spears]] which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Perry emerges from the [[cave]], wearing a leopard-print [[bikini]] top, a [[grass skirt]], laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a [[waterfall]], overlooking the [[jungle]], and then swings across the sky on a [[vine]].\n\nWith the help of the monkey, Perry builds a [[cat toy]] that she uses to distract the tiger who killed her boyfriend earlier in the video. The two of them roar at each other until her roar [[Tame animal|tames]] the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, she is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a [[flower]] crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a [[collar (animal)|collar]] that says \"Kitty Purry\", a reference to her real-life cat of the same name. Perry takes [[selfie]]s with the monkey on her boyfriend's [[Product placement|phone]], applies lipstick made from berry juice, and gives the elephant a pedicure. She then awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to think all the previous events have just been a dream, but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.\n\n===Reception===\nUpon its release, the music video received mixed reviews from critics. [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] contributors Robbie Daw, Sam Lansky, and Carl Willott gave it mostly lackluster reviews. Daw considered that the release of such a \"safe\" video was a disappointment for Perry and expressed eagerness to her next single; while Lansky likened its \"edg[iness]\" to that of a \"woman's antiperspirant commercial\"; and the latter divided the video in what he considered to be of \"good cheesy\" and \"bad cheesy\": he highlighted the fake set, Perry's acting and the ending, but criticized the CGI, which he deemed \"dopey\", the product placement and Perry's \"overly literal roar-off with a tiger\". The only writer for the website that gave the visual a favorable review was Mike Wass, who appreciated the \"campy element[s]\" in it, while noting that it drew inspiration from the [[Doctor Jones#Music video|music video for \"Doctor Jones\"]] by the dance-pop group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]].

a song by American singer [[Katy Perry]] for her fourth [[studio album]], ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013). It was released as the lead single from the record on August 10, 2013. Perry co-wrote the song with [[Bonnie McKee]] and its producers [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]]. It is a [[pop music|pop song]] containing elements of [[arena rock]] and lyrics centering on standing up for oneself and self-empowerment.\n\nTo promote the song, Perry performed under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] at the end of the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], on ''[[The X Factor (Australian TV series)|The X Factor Australia]]'', at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in late October 2013, and on the German TV show ''[[Schlag den Raab]]''. Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi directed the song's music video, which features Perry trying to adapt to the jungle and taming a [[tiger]] after surviving a plane crash. Though the song received generally mixed reviews, it was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe song was a commercial success, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Lebanon, New Zealand, Scotland, Slovenia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. By the end of 2013, \"Roar\" had sold 9.9 million units (combined sales and track-equivalent streams) globally according to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). \"Roar\" has sold over 6 million copies in the US, over 1 million in the UK, and was Australia's best-selling single of 2013 with 560,000 copies sold within the year.

Perry shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes [[selfie|pictures of himself]] and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a [[tiger]] and Perry dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a [[crocodile]] when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a [[tarantula]] crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a [[tiger]] instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be [[fireflies]] which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.\n\n[[File:Katy Perry-Roar video.jpg|thumb|left|Perry in the music video for \"Roar\" dressed as \"Queen of the Jungle\".]]\nPresumably a few days later, Perry has since made friends with a [[monkey]] and uses her [[stiletto heel]] to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a [[banana]], which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, with the help of an [[elephant]] who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Perry helps a [[crocodile]] by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with [[fire]]; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting [[spears]] which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Perry emerges from the [[cave]], wearing a leopard-print [[bikini]] top, a [[grass skirt]], laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a [[waterfall]], overlooking the [[jungle]], and then swings across the sky on a [[vine]].\n\nWith the help of the monkey, Perry builds a [[cat toy]] that she uses to distract the tiger who killed her boyfriend earlier in the video. The two of them roar at each other until her roar [[Tame animal|tames]] the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, she is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a [[flower]] crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a [[collar (animal)|collar]] that says \"Kitty Purry\", a reference to her real-life cat of the same name. Perry takes [[selfie]]s with the monkey on her boyfriend's [[Product placement|phone]], applies lipstick made from berry juice, and gives the elephant a pedicure. She then awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to think all the previous events have just been a dream, but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.\n\n===Reception===\nUpon its release, the music video received mixed reviews from critics. [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] contributors Robbie Daw, Sam Lansky, and Carl Willott gave it mostly lackluster reviews. Daw considered that the release of such a \"safe\" video was a disappointment for Perry and expressed eagerness to her next single; while Lansky likened its \"edg[iness]\" to that of a \"woman's antiperspirant commercial\"; and the latter divided the video in what he considered to be of \"good cheesy\" and \"bad cheesy\": he highlighted the fake set, Perry's acting and the ending, but criticized the CGI, which he deemed \"dopey\", the product placement and Perry's \"overly literal roar-off with a tiger\". The only writer for the website that gave the visual a favorable review was Mike Wass, who appreciated the \"campy element[s]\" in it, while noting that it drew inspiration from the [[Doctor Jones#Music video|music video for \"Doctor Jones\"]] by the dance-pop group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]].

Bengals]] in their home opener against the [[Bengals\u2013Steelers rivalry|rival]] [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', to tie in the song's

Throughout the game, the song was also played sporadically during game breaks. Although the Bengals won the game 20-10, the song drew much criticism by Bengals fans and even some of the team's players. One Bengals fan even told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[Steeler Nation|Steeler fans]] sitting near him were laughing at the Bengals fans throughout the game; the Steelers themselves have used the [[Styx (band)|Styx]] song \"[[Renegade (Styx song)|Renegade]]\" frequently at [[Heinz Field]] since 2001.<ref name=steelers>{{Cite news | title = Steelers Turn To Power Of 'Renegade' To Fuel Defense: 'Oh Momma' Rallying Cry For Black And Gold| publisher = thepittsburghchannel.com| date = November 9, 2009 | url = http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/sports/21562637/detail.html|archivedate=November 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lUNrH0FM?url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/sports/21562637/detail.html}}</ref> Four days after the game, the team publicly apologized, announcing that while the song would not be nixed from [[Paul Brown Stadium]]'s playlist completely, the team would use a [[hard rock]] or [[classic rock]] song for player introductions moving forward.<ref name=ESPN>{{cite web|title=Katy Perry song nixed for intros |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9701089/cincinnati-bengals-tone-katy-perry-roar-fan-backlash |publisher=ESPN |date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231005020/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9701089/cincinnati-bengals-tone-katy-perry-roar-fan-backlash |archivedate=December 31, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n\"Roar\" was also used as the theme song of [[WTA number 1|world number 1]] tennis player [[Serena Williams]] during the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|2014 US Open Championships]].

It was built in 1927 by the British but discontinued beyond Birgunj in December 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|title=Transport in Nepal|publisher=nepal.saarctourism.org|access-date=2008-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229011939/http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|archive-date=2008-12-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Rail Transport===\nTrains run to major cities of India from Raxaul station (in India, adjacent to Birgunj) and Sugauli station (17 miles from Raxaul) including the [[Satyagrah Express]] to [[Delhi]], [[Mithila Express]] to [[Kolkata]], Lokmanya Tilak express to [[Mumbai]], and HYD-RXL express to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Thus, Birgunj has direct connectivity to major Indian cities like - Patna, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Amritsar, Guwahati, Bhopal, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Ranchi, Raipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, etc.\n\n===Air Transport===\nBirgunj is served by [[Simara Airport]], which lies 9 miles North of the city. Regular flights operate between Kathmandu & Simara. The second International Airport of Nepal is under construction at Nijgadh (22 miles from Birganj). There are plans to connect the new airport, Birgunj and Kathmandu via a \"Fasttrack\" expressway after its completion. This is expected to reduce travel times between the capital and the commercial capital, Birgunj\n\n===Buses===\nThere are regular bus services to all major cities and towns in Nepal including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Patan, Bhaktapur, Biratnagar, Dharan, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, Kakarvitta, Janakpur, Bhairahawa(Lumbini), Bharatpur(Chitwan), etc.\nLocal bus services provide transportation inside the city and into its vicinity.

Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the [[Sirsiya]] (Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.\n\nGoods are transported to and from India via Birgunj dry port, which is the key terminal of surface cargo delivery to Nepal. This cargo point on the south connects the heart of the country, Kathmandu, via another key industrial city, [[Hetauda]]. It is also served by [[Tribhuvan Highway]], extending from the Indian border at Raxaul through Birgunj and Hetauda to Kathmandu with frequent bus service. [[Simara Airport]] \u2014 {{Convert|9|mi|km|abbr=on}} north near the highway in [[Pipara Simara]], [[Bara district]] \u2014 offers scheduled flights to Kathmandu.\n\nIndia and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on the movement of their citizens.

Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the [[Sirsiya]] (Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.\n\nGoods are transported to and from India via Birgunj dry port, which is the key terminal of surface cargo delivery to Nepal. This cargo point on the south connects the heart of the country, Kathmandu, via another key industrial city, [[Hetauda]]. It is also served by [[Tribhuvan Highway]], extending from the Indian border at Raxaul through Birgunj and Hetauda to Kathmandu with frequent bus service. [[Simara Airport]] \u2014 {{Convert|9|mi|km|abbr=on}} north near the highway in [[Pipara Simara]], [[Bara district]] \u2014 offers scheduled flights to Kathmandu.\n\nIndia and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on the movement of their citizens. There is a [[Geography of Nepal#Border crossing|customs checkpoint]] for the movement of goods and third country nationals.{{Clarify|date=August 2014|reason=How do they prove they are from Nepal or India without a passport?}}\n\n==Sports==\n\n[[File:Narayani Rangasala.jpg|thumb|Narayani Rangasala]]\nThe city has its own stadium, [[Narayani Stadium]] which is Nepal's second largest stadium after Dasarath Rangasala. The stadium has capacity of 15,000 seats. In recent times the stadium is in poor condition.\nA national level [[Cricket]] Ground is also located beside the Narayani Stadium. The cricket ground has top class outfield and a better [[cricket pitch]]. National level and Regional level cricket tournament are regularly held here.

It is a large rally, several hundred people packed into a square, the largest protest against the current government, yet it is wholly peaceful. Michael receives a radio order to open fire and disperse the crowd. He protests, it is a peaceful rally, but his supervisor, acting on political pressure from above, repeats the order to fire. Michael fires a single shot that accidentally hits a 12-year-old boy.\n\nMichael is diagnosed with \"progressive myopia\" and subsequently fired from his position without severance or pension benefits. He begins receiving angry phone calls from the father of the dead boy. The father threatens to kill Michael's 8-year-old son Roy on his 12th birthday.\n\nA couple of years later Michael is living in a small apartment with his son. He makes a miserable living as a projectionist in a movie theater and ekes out some additional income pirating movies for a gang of local thugs. Michael is always harangued by his landlord, the drunk and bitter Mr. DCosta, and continues to receive progressively more threatening calls from the dead boy's father. His only goal is to get his son out of the city and into a boarding school. Rwitika, his only friend, occasionally looks after Roy and urges Michael to pick up and move on. The landlord DCosta frequently bullies and browbeats Michael for overdue rent. Michael is saving furiously to send Roy away and moves the money about his apartment so DCosta cannot find it. Amid this turmoil he finds a quiet comfort in Mrs DCosta who generally sympathizes with him and occasionally warns him if DCosta is about to go on the warpath.\n\nA few days before Roy's 12th birthday Michael gets intensely threatening phone calls. He stumbles out of his movie theater (and forgets an important movie copying job for which he has received an advance). His midget assistant Makkhan copies the movie and tries to sell it to a rival gang. Michael returns later and picks up a DVD (empty, since Makkhan took the movie DVD) and delivers it. When Michael returns home he finds his money gone and the gang boys outside who beat him up until he figures out what happened. His assistant Makkhan shows up, badly beaten up, and discloses that the rival gang members took the DVD and beat him up and gave him no money. If Michael had paid him more money he would not have gone to the other gang. They argue about the money until Michael discovers that his money is gone! Michael, slowly unspooling into insanity, moves Roy to Rwitika's place and subsequently beseeches her to send him away. He barges into DCosta's flat, across the hall, to see them celebrating something. In a maddened (and drunk) stupor Michael threatens DCosta with a pistol and later begs him to return the money. DCosta, himself drunk, curses and berates Michael whereupon Michael, crazed with anger, shoots DCosta dead! His wife reveals that it was she who took the money for her fertility treatment. Michael is shocked and hurt that she betrayed his trust. He runs out of the flat and, knowing that the police will hunt him down for murder, goes to get Roy out of the city.\n\nMichael hurries to Rwitika's place to get Roy. It is midnight, Roy's birthday. Michael runs across a crossroad. A public phone rings, Michael stops to pick it up, it is the dead boy's father, he will shoot Roy! Michael begs him to stop ... Rwitika comes on the line next!

It is a large rally, several hundred people packed into a square, the largest protest against the current government, yet it is wholly peaceful. Michael receives a radio order to open fire and disperse the crowd. He protests, it is a peaceful rally, but his supervisor, acting on political pressure from above, repeats the order to fire. Michael fires a single shot that accidentally hits a 12-year-old boy.\n\nMichael is diagnosed with \"progressive myopia\" and subsequently fired from his position without severance or pension benefits. He begins receiving angry phone calls from the father of the dead boy. The father threatens to kill Michael's 8-year-old son Roy on his 12th birthday.\n\nA couple of years later Michael is living in a small apartment with his son. He makes a miserable living as a projectionist in a movie theater and ekes out some additional income pirating movies for a gang of local thugs. Michael is always harangued by his landlord, the drunk and bitter Mr. DCosta, and continues to receive progressively more threatening calls from the dead boy's father. His only goal is to get his son out of the city and into a boarding school. Rwitika, his only friend, occasionally looks after Roy and urges Michael to pick up and move on. The landlord DCosta frequently bullies and browbeats Michael for overdue rent. Michael is saving furiously to send Roy away and moves the money about his apartment so DCosta cannot find it. Amid this turmoil he finds a quiet comfort in Mrs DCosta who generally sympathizes with him and occasionally warns him if DCosta is about to go on the warpath.\n\nA few days before Roy's 12th birthday Michael gets intensely threatening phone calls. He stumbles out of his movie theater (and forgets an important movie copying job for which he has received an advance). His midget assistant Makkhan copies the movie and tries to sell it to a rival gang. Michael returns later and picks up a DVD (empty, since Makkhan took the movie DVD) and delivers it. When Michael returns home he finds his money gone and the gang boys outside who beat him up until he figures out what happened. His assistant Makkhan shows up, badly beaten up, and discloses that the rival gang members took the DVD and beat him up and gave him no money. If Michael had paid him more money he would not have gone to the other gang. They argue about the money until Michael discovers that his money is gone! Michael, slowly unspooling into insanity, moves Roy to Rwitika's place and subsequently beseeches her to send him away. He barges into DCosta's flat, across the hall, to see them celebrating something. In a maddened (and drunk) stupor Michael threatens DCosta with a pistol and later begs him to return the money. DCosta, himself drunk, curses and berates Michael whereupon Michael, crazed with anger, shoots DCosta dead! His wife reveals that it was she who took the money for her fertility treatment. Michael is shocked and hurt that she betrayed his trust. He runs out of the flat and, knowing that the police will hunt him down for murder, goes to get Roy out of the city.\n\nMichael hurries to Rwitika's place to get Roy. It is midnight, Roy's birthday. Michael runs across a crossroad. A public phone rings, Michael stops to pick it up, it is the dead boy's father, he will shoot Roy! Michael begs him to stop ... Rwitika comes on the line next! Michael hangs up the phone and steps into the road when a passing taxicab runs him over and kills him. It is revealed that Michael had been hearing voices all along (there was no father of the dead boy) and his guilt over the boy at the rally slowly drove him insane. The film ends as a police jeep finds his body and calls for an ambulance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as Michael\n* [[Mahie Gill]] as Rwitika\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]]\n* [[Rudranil Ghosh]]\n* [[Irawati Harshe]]\n* [[Churni Ganguly]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1754202|Michael}}\n\n{{Anurag Kashyap|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Michael}}\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:2010s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s Hindi-language films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Indian thriller films]]\n[[Category:Indian drama films]]\n[[Category:2011 directorial debut films]]\n", "name_user": "Lugnuts", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(2011_Indian_film)"}

This is despite indications that Bruegel did make use of preparatory studies. Both ''Tower'' versions are full of the type of details which are likely to have been worked out in sketches first.<ref>Orenstein, 30-31</ref>  Except for a lack of mountains, the paintings contain the main ingredients of the [[world landscape]], a type of composition followed in many of Bruegel's earlier landscapes.  The Vienna tower is built around a very steep small mountain, which can be seen protruding from the architecture at the centre near the ground and to the right higher up.\n\n==Provenance==\nThe Vienna painting is signed and dated \"Brvegel.
