In 1986 Mills moved to London and became a bus driver, used for his 2009 novel ''[[The Maintenance of Headway]]''.

Having written his first quartet of novels for Flamingo, ''Explorers of the New Century'' marked a new partnership with [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. Mills has also written two books of very short stories: ''[[Once in a Blue Moon (stories)|Once in a Blue Moon]]'' and ''Only When the Sun Shines Brightly'' for Acorn Books. In his 2011 novel ''[[A Cruel Bird Came to the Nest and Looked In]]'', Mills depicts a kingdom whose king has gone missing without explanation, leaving an absurdist realm \"lost in an English fairy-tale world.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Zadie |authorlink=Zadie Smith |date=October 2011 |title=New Books |journal=[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |publisher=Harper's Foundation |volume=323 |issue=1,937 |pages=75\u201378 |url=http://harpers.org/archive/2011/10/new-books-30/ |accessdate=6 July 2013 }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nMills's 2015 novel ''[[The Field of the Cloth of Gold (novel)|The Field of the Cloth of Gold]]'' was shortlisted for the 2015 [[Goldsmiths Prize]].<ref name=\"GUL\">Goldsmiths, University of London: ''Goldsmiths Prize shortlist \u2013 six works of fiction at its most novel'', http://www.gold.ac.uk/news/goldsmiths-prize-shortlist-2015/.</ref>\n\n==Style==\nMagnus Mills's style has been called \"deceptively\" simple.<ref>The Complete Review: ''What others have to say about Magnus Mills'', [http://www.complete-review.com/authors/millsma.htm, accessed 27 August 2011.]</ref> His prose style is rhythmic, often repetitious, and his humour is deadpan.

Mills has cited [[Primo Levi]] as a key influence.<ref>BookRags, Inc.: ''Magnus Mills Biography'', [http://www.bookrags.com/biography/magnus-mills-dlb/, 2011.]</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nMagnus Mills's books usually feature one or more working-class men as protagonist.<ref>World News Network: ''Book Review: Three Novels by Magnus Mills'', [http://wn.com/Book_review_three_novels_by_Magnus_Mills, Published: 20 September 2009, Uploaded: 19 June 2011.]</ref> In ''The Restraint of Beasts'', an unnamed supervisor works alongside two Scottish fence-builders as they move from location to location building high-tensile steel fences. The theme of repetition is established early on, as the men fall into a routine of working during the day, going to the local pub at night and \"accidentally\" killing people along the way. The same kind of skewed repetition occurs in Mills's later works ''[[All Quiet on the Orient Express]]'' and ''[[The Scheme for Full Employment]]''. ''All Quiet on the Orient Express'' is about a man who stops at a camp site in the [[Lake District]] to kill some time before embarking on a journey on the [[Orient Express]]. Gradually, he becomes involved in the local community and offered jobs until it becomes clear that he may never leave. ''The Scheme for Full Employment'' tells of a \"beautiful\" scheme whereby people are employed to drive around on set routes, stopping at depots to offload the contents of their vans.\n\nFreedom of will is a key theme in Mills' work.<ref>Kevin Corbett: ''Great 21st Century Writers You Need to Read: Magnus Mills'', [http://www.karlonia.com/2010/09/26/contemporary-literature-writers/, 26 September 2010.]</ref> What do the fences in ''The Restraint of Beasts'' suggest? Who, or what are the \"beasts\"? Can the protagonist of ''All Quiet on the Orient Express'' ever assert his freedom? Does it exist? This theme is explored most vividly in ''[[Three to See the King]]'', whose characters live in a largely allegorical world that lacks many of the identifiable conventions of working class life \u2014 they don't have jobs, pubs or anything more than a rudimentary social network. The main character attempts to establish a simple freedom for himself within his small, beloved house, only to find himself at the mercy of unsolicited relationships and the ideology of a charismatic newcomer. Like most of Mills's characters, he remains desperately attached to his routine, attempting to meet each twist with a calm, reasonable approach, until it becomes impossible. In ''Explorers of the New Century'', the characters begin as masters of their mules and the art of exploration, but as their journey continues, the harsh climate and terrain of the land strip them of control over their own destinies. At the outset of the book, the explorers are able to assign or deny freedom to their mules; by the end, most of the explorers are dependent on the mules for their own freedom.\n\nMills himself has talked about punishment and reward as being key themes in his work, particularly in ''The Restraint of Beasts''.<ref>Corbett, 2010.</ref> The leaders of the teams in ''Explorers of the New Century'' struggle with punishment as a means of encouraging and disciplining their mules, never able to achieve quite the results they desire, but fearful of interacting with the mules by any means more complex than punishment and reward.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Novels===\n*''[[The Restraint of Beasts]]'' (1998)\n*''[[All Quiet on the Orient Express]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Three to See the King]]'' (2001)\n*''[[The Scheme for Full Employment]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Explorers of the New Century]]'' (2005)\n*''[[The Maintenance of Headway]]'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/Books/details.aspx?isbn=9781408800355 |title=The Maintenance of Headway |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref>\n*''[[A Cruel Bird Came to the Nest and Looked In]]'' (2011)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/Cruel-Bird-Came-to-the-Nest-and-Looked-In/Magnus-Mills/books/details/9781408821206 |title=A Cruel Bird Came to the Nest and Looked In |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref>\n*''[[The Field of the Cloth of Gold (novel)|The Field of the Cloth of Gold]]'' (2015)<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Field of the Cloth of Gold |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/au/the-field-of-the-cloth-of-gold-9781408860021/ |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n*''[[The Forensic Records Society]]'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Forensic Records Society |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-forensic-records-society-9781408878378/ |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref>\n*Tales Of Muffled Oars (2020) \n\n===Short story collections===\n*''Only When the Sun Shines Brightly'' (1999)\n*''[[Once in a Blue Moon (stories)|Once in a Blue Moon]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Screwtop Thompson]]'' (2010)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.spikemagazine.com/0399beasts.php Spike Magazine's review of ''The Restraint of Beasts'']\n*[https://danieldaviswood.com/2016/10/11/the-seeds-of-mills-field Essay on Mills' first eight novels, focusing on his aesthetic interests]\n*[http://www.barcelonareview.com/13/e_mm_int.htm Interview with MAGNUS MILLS by Marcia Morgado]\n*[http://www.zyworld.com/albionmagazineonline/books14_magnus_mills.htm Overview of MAGNUS MILLS in Albion Magazine Online]\n\n{{Magnus Mills}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mills, Magnus}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Wolverhampton]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Warwick]]\n[[Category:21st-century English novelists]]\n[[Category:English short story writers]]\n[[Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Writers from Bristol]]\n[[Category:English male short story writers]]\n[[Category:English male novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century British short story writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century British male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2012}}\n{{Infobox writer\n|name = Magnus Mills\n|image = \n|imagesize = \n|alt = \n|caption = \n|pseudonym = \n|birth_name = \n|birth_date = {{Birth year and age|1954}}\n|birth_place = [[Birmingham]], England\n|death_date = \n|death_place = \n|occupation = Novelist, short-story author\n|citizenship = \n|education = \n|alma_mater = \n|period = 1998\u2013present\n|genre = \n|subject = \n|movement = \n|notableworks = ''[[The Restraint of Beasts]]'', ''[[All Quiet on the Orient Express]]''\n|spouse = \n|partner = \n|children = \n|relatives = \n|awards = {{awd|[[McKitterick Prize]]|1999|[[The Restraint of Beasts]]}}\n|signature = \n|website = \n|portaldisp = \n}}\n\n'''Magnus Mills''' is an English novelist and short story writer.\n\n==Background==\nMagnus Mills was born in [[Birmingham]] and brought up in [[Bristol]].

{"title_page": "Presidential system", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of government}}\n{{Systems of government}}\nA '''presidential system''' is a [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[republic]]an [[government]] in which a [[head of government]] leads an [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] that is separate from the [[legislative branch]]. This head of government is in most cases also the [[head of state]], which is called ''[[President (government title)|president]]''\nSyed Halimuzzaman \nIn presidential countries, the executive is [[Election|elected]] and is not [[Responsible government|responsible]] to the legislature, which cannot in normal circumstances [[Dissolution of parliament|dismiss]] it. Such dismissal is possible, however, in uncommon cases, often through [[impeachment]].\n\nThe title \"[[President (government title)|president]]\" has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body, as with the [[President of the Continental Congress]] in the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|early United States]], prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government.\n\nA presidential system contrasts with a [[parliamentary system]], where the head of government comes to power by gaining the confidence of an elected [[legislature]]. There is also a hybrid system called [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidentialism]].\n\nCountries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president. Heads of state of [[parliamentary republic]]s, largely ceremonial in most cases, are called presidents. [[Dictator]]s or leaders of [[one-party state]]s, whether popularly elected or not, are also often called presidents.\n\nPresidentialism is the dominant form of government in the mainland [[Americas]], with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics, with the exception of [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Belize|Belize]], and [[Politics of Suriname|Suriname]] ([[South America]] is also the only continent in the world to have no monarchies). It is also prevalent in [[Central Africa|Central]] and southern [[West Africa]] and in [[Central Asia]]. There are no presidential republics in Europe (whether nominally or in practice), with the exception for [[politics of Turkey|Turkey]], [[politics of Belarus|Belarus]], France and [[Politics of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. Oceania also has no presidential republics.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIn a full-fledged presidential system, a politician is chosen directly by the public or indirectly by the winning party to be the [[head of government]]. Except for [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]], this head of government is also the [[head of state]], and is therefore called ''president''. The post of [[prime minister]] (also called premier) may also exist in a presidential system, but unlike in [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] or parliamentary systems, the prime minister answers to the president and not to the legislature.\n\nThe following characteristics apply generally for the numerous presidential governments across the world:\n* The executive can [[veto]] legislative acts and, in turn, a [[supermajority]] of lawmakers may override the veto. The veto is generally derived from the [[United Kingdom|British]] tradition of [[royal assent]] in which an act of parliament can only be enacted with the assent of the [[British monarchy|monarch]].\n* The president has a fixed term of office. Elections are held at regular times and cannot be triggered by a [[vote of confidence]] or other parliamentary procedures, although in some countries there is an exception which provides for the removal of a president who is found to have broken a law.\n* The executive branch is unipersonal. Members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] serve at the pleasure of the president and must carry out the policies of the executive and legislative branches. Cabinet ministers or executive departmental chiefs are not members of the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, presidential systems often need legislative approval of executive nominations to the cabinet, [[judicial review|judiciary]], and various lower governmental posts. A president generally can direct members of the cabinet, military, or any officer or employee of the executive branch, but cannot direct or dismiss judges.\n* The president can often [[pardon]] or [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] sentences of convicted criminals.\n\n== Subnational governments of the world ==\n{{See also|State governments of the United States}}\nSubnational governments, usually states, may be structured as presidential systems. All of the state governments in the United States use the presidential system, even though this is not constitutionally required. On a local level, many cities use [[council-manager government]], which is equivalent to a parliamentary system, although the post of a [[city manager]] is normally a non-political position. Some countries without a presidential system at the national level use a form of this system at a subnational or local level. One example is [[Japan]], where the national government uses the parliamentary system, but the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and [[Municipalities of Japan|municipal governments]] have governors and mayors elected independently from local assemblies and councils.\n\n== Advantages ==\nSupporters generally claim four basic advantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Direct elections''' \u2014 in a presidential system, the president is often elected directly by the people. This makes the president's power more legitimate than that of a leader appointed indirectly. However, this is not a necessary feature of a presidential system. Some presidential states have an indirectly elected head of state.\n* '''Separation of powers''' \u2014 a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. This allows each structure to monitor and check the other, preventing abuses of power.\n* '''Speed and decisiveness''' \u2014 A president with strong powers can usually enact changes quickly. However, the separation of powers can also slow the system down.\n* '''Stability''' \u2014 a president, by virtue of a fixed term, may provide more stability than a prime minister, who can be dismissed at any time.\n\n=== Direct elections ===\nIn most presidential systems, the president is elected by popular vote, although some such as the [[United States]] use an [[United States electoral college|electoral college]] (which is itself directly elected) or some other method.<ref>The \"presidential\" model implies that the Chief Executive is elected by all those members of the electoral body: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Titolo V e \"forme di governo\": il caso Abruzzo (dopo la Calabria)|journal= Diritto&Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2003| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89381752}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>  By this method, the president receives a personal mandate to lead the country, whereas in a parliamentary system a candidate might only receive a personal mandate to represent a constituency. That means a president can only be elected independently of the legislative branch.\n\n=== Separation of powers ===\nA presidential system's separation of the executive from the legislature is sometimes held up as an advantage, in that each branch may scrutinize the actions of the other. In a parliamentary system, the executive is drawn from the legislature, making criticism of one by the other considerably less likely. A formal condemnation of the executive by the legislature is often considered a [[vote of no confidence]]. According to supporters of the presidential system, the lack of checks and balances means that misconduct by a prime minister may never be discovered. Writing about [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], [[Woodrow Wyatt]], a former MP in the UK, said \"don't think a Watergate couldn't happen here, you just wouldn't hear about it.\" (ibid)\n\nCritics respond that if a presidential system's legislature is controlled by the president's party, the same situation exists. Proponents{{Who|date=March 2017}} note that even in such a situation a legislator from the president's party is in a better position to criticize the president or his policies should he deem it necessary, since the immediate security of the president's position is less dependent on legislative support. In parliamentary systems, [[party discipline]] is much more strictly enforced. If a parliamentary [[backbencher]] publicly criticizes the executive or its policies to any significant extent then he/she faces a much higher prospect of losing his/her party's nomination, or even outright expulsion from the party. Even mild criticism from a backbencher could carry consequences serious enough (in particular, removal from consideration for a cabinet post) to effectively muzzle a legislator with any serious political ambitions.\n\nDespite the existence of the no confidence vote, in practice it is extremely difficult to stop a prime minister or cabinet that has made its decision. In a parliamentary system, if important legislation proposed by the incumbent prime minister and his cabinet is \"voted down\" by a majority of the members of parliament then it is considered a vote of no confidence. To emphasize that particular point, a prime minister will often declare a particular legislative vote to be a matter of confidence at the first sign of reluctance on the part of legislators from his or her own party. If a government loses a parliamentary vote of confidence, then the incumbent government must then either resign or call elections to be held, a consequence few backbenchers are willing to endure. Hence, a no confidence vote in some parliamentary countries, like Britain, only occurs a few times in a century. In 1931, [[David Lloyd George]] told a select committee: \"Parliament has really no control over the executive; it is a pure fiction.\" (Schlesinger 1982)\n\nBy contrast, if a presidential legislative initiative fails to pass a legislature controlled by the president's party (e.g. the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]] in the United States), it may damage the president's political standing and that of his party, but generally has no immediate effect on whether or not the president completes his term.\n\n=== Speed and decisiveness ===\nSome supporters of presidential systems claim{{Who|date=September 2016}} that presidential systems can respond more rapidly to emerging situations than parliamentary ones. A prime minister, when taking action, needs to retain the support of the legislature, but a president is often less constrained. In ''[[Why England Slept]]'', future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] argued that British prime ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] were constrained by the need to maintain the confidence of the Commons.\n\nOther supporters of presidential systems sometimes argue in the exact opposite direction, however, saying that presidential systems can slow decision-making to beneficial ends. Divided government, where the presidency and the legislature are controlled by different parties, is said to restrain the excesses of both the coalition and opposition, and guarantee cross-partisan input into legislation. In the United States, Republican Congressman [[Bill Frenzel]] wrote in 1995:\n\n{{quote|\"There are some of us who think [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]] is the best thing since indoor plumbing. Gridlock is the natural gift the Framers of the Constitution gave us so that the country would not be subjected to policy swings resulting from the whimsy of the public. And the competition\u2014whether multi-branch, multi-level, or multi-house\u2014is important to those checks and balances and to our ongoing kind of centrist government. Thank heaven we do not have a government that nationalizes one year and privatizes next year, and so on ''ad infinitum''\". (Checks and Balances, 8)}}\n\n=== Stability ===\nAlthough most parliamentary governments go long periods of time without a no confidence vote, [[Italy]], [[Israel]], and the [[French Fourth Republic]] have all experienced difficulties maintaining stability. When parliamentary systems have multiple parties, and governments are forced to rely on coalitions, as they often do in nations that use a system of [[proportional representation]], extremist parties can theoretically use the threat of leaving a coalition to further their agendas.\n\nMany people consider presidential systems more able to survive emergencies. A country under enormous stress may, supporters argue, be better off being led by a president with a fixed term than rotating premierships. [[France]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian controversy]] switched to a [[semi-presidential system]] as did [[Sri Lanka]] during its civil war, while [[Israel]] experimented with a directly elected [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]] in 1992. In France and Sri Lanka, the results are widely considered to have been positive. However, in the case of Israel, an unprecedented proliferation of smaller parties occurred, leading to the restoration of the previous system of selecting a prime minister.\n\nThe fact that elections are fixed in a presidential system is considered by supporters a welcome \"check\" on the powers of the executive, contrasting parliamentary systems, which may allow the prime minister to call elections whenever they see fit or orchestrate their own vote of no confidence to trigger an election when they cannot get a legislative item passed. The presidential model is said to discourage this sort of opportunism, and instead forces the executive to operate within the confines of a term they cannot alter to suit their own needs. <!-- Theoretically, if a president's positions and actions have had a positive impact on their respective country, then it is likely that their party's candidate (possibly the sitting president) will be elected for another term in office. [This, of course, also applies in a parliamentary system.] -->\n\nProponents of the presidential system also argue that stability extends to the cabinets chosen under the system, compared to a parliamentary system where cabinets must be drawn from within the legislative branch.  Under the presidential system, cabinet members can be selected from a much larger pool of potential candidates.  This allows presidents the ability to select cabinet members based as much or more on their ability and competency to lead a particular department as on their loyalty to the president, as opposed to parliamentary cabinets, which might be filled by legislators chosen for no better reason than their perceived loyalty to the prime minister.  Supporters of the presidential system note that parliamentary systems are prone{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} to disruptive \"[[cabinet shuffle]]s\" where legislators are moved between portfolios, whereas in presidential system cabinets (such as the [[United States Cabinet]]), cabinet shuffles are unusual.\n\n== Criticism and disadvantages ==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}}\nCritics generally claim three basic disadvantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Tendency towards authoritarianism''' \u2013 some political scientists say presidentialism raises the stakes of elections, exacerbates their polarization and can lead to authoritarianism (Linz).\n* '''Political gridlock''' \u2013 the separation of powers of a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. Critics argue that this can create an undesirable and long-term [[gridlock (politics)|political gridlock]] whenever the president and the legislative majority are from different parties, which is common because the electorate usually expects more rapid results from new policies than are possible (Linz, Mainwaring and Shugart). In addition, this reduces accountability by allowing the president and the legislature to shift blame to each other.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy, AP* Edition \u2013 2016 Presidential Election, 17th Edition|last=George|first=Edwards|last2=Warrenberg|first2=Martin|publisher=Pearson Higher Education|year=2016|isbn=9780134586571|location=|pages=16}}</ref>\n* '''Impediments to leadership change''' \u2013 presidential systems often make it difficult to remove a president from office early, for example after taking actions that become unpopular.\n\nA fourth criticism applies specifically to nations with a proportionally elected legislature and a presidency. Where the voters are virtually all represented by their votes in the proportional outcome, the presidency is elected on a winner-take-all basis. Two different electoral systems are therefore in play, potentially leading to conflicts that are based on the natural differences of the systems.\n\n=== Tendency towards authoritarianism ===\nA prime minister without majority support in the legislature must either form a coalition or, if able to lead a minority government, govern in a manner acceptable to at least some of the opposition parties. Even with a majority government, the prime minister must still govern within (perhaps unwritten) constraints as determined by the members of his party\u2014a premier in this situation is often at greater risk of losing his party leadership than his party is at risk of losing the next election. On the other hand, winning the presidency is a winner-take-all, [[zero-sum game]]. Once elected, a president might be able to marginalize the influence of other parties and exclude rival factions in his own party as well, or even leave the party whose ticket he was elected under. The president can thus rule without any party support until the next election or abuse his power to win multiple terms, a worrisome situation for many interest groups. Yale political scientist [[Juan Linz]] argues that:\n\n{{quote|The danger that zero-sum presidential elections pose is compounded by the rigidity of the president's fixed term in office. Winners and losers are sharply defined for the entire period of the presidential mandate&nbsp;... losers must wait four or five years without any access to executive power and patronage. The zero-sum game in presidential regimes raises the stakes of presidential elections and inevitably exacerbates their attendant tension and polarization.}}\n\nConstitutions that only require [[Plurality voting system|plurality support]] are said{{By whom|date=January 2012}} to be especially undesirable, as significant power can be vested in a person who does not enjoy support from a majority of the population.\n\nSome political scientists say that presidential systems are not constitutionally stable and have difficulty sustaining democratic practices, noting that presidentialism has slipped into authoritarianism in many of the countries in which it has been implemented. According to political scientist [[Fred Riggs]], presidentialism has fallen into authoritarianism in nearly every country it has been attempted.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1997|title=Presidentialism versus Parliamentarism: Implications for Representativeness and Legitimacy|jstor=1601343|journal=International Political Science Review |volume= 18| issue =  3|page=258|last1=Riggs|first1=Fred W.|doi=10.1177/019251297018003003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=1994|title=Conceptual homogenization of a heterogeneous field: Presidentialism in comparative perspective|journal=Comparing Nations: Concepts, Strategies, Substance|pages=72\u2013152}}</ref> Political sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] pointed out that this has taken place in political cultures not conducive to democracy and that militaries have tended to play a prominent role in most of these countries. On the other hand, an often-cited{{By whom|date=January 2012}} [[How Democratic Is the American Constitution?#List of countries steadily democratic since at least 1950|list of the world's 22 older democracies]] includes only two countries ([[Costa Rica]] and the [[United States]]) with presidential systems.\n\nIn a presidential system, the legislature and the president have equal mandates from the public. Conflicts between the branches of government might not be reconciled. When president and legislature disagree and government is not working effectively, there is a strong incentive to use extra-constitutional measures to break the deadlock.  Of the [[separation of powers|three common branches]] of government, the executive is in the best position to use extra-constitutional measures, especially when the president is head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the military. By contrast, in a parliamentary system where the often-ceremonial head of state is either a constitutional monarch or (in the case of a parliamentary republic) an experienced and respected figure, given some political emergency there is a good chance that even a ceremonial head of state will be able to use emergency [[reserve powers]] to restrain a head of government acting in an emergency extra-constitutional manner \u2013 this is only possible because the head of state and the head of government are not the same person.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Dana D.

This is common because the electorate often expects more rapid results than are possible from new policies and switches to a different party at the next election.<ref name=\":0\" /> Critics such as [[Juan Linz]], argue that this inherent political instability can cause democracies to fail, as seen in such cases as Brazil and Chile.<ref>Linz, J. (1990). The perils of presidentialism. The journal of democracy, Volume 1(1), pp. 51-69.</ref>\n\n==== Lack of accountability ====\nIn such cases of gridlock, presidential systems are said by critics<ref>Linz, J. (1985). Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference. Connecticut: Yale university press</ref> not to offer voters the kind of accountability seen in parliamentary systems. It is easy for either the president or the legislature to escape blame by shifting it to the other. Describing the United States, former Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]] said \"the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=James|title=Constitutional Reform and Effective Government|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1/page/11 11]}}</ref> Years before becoming President, [[Woodrow Wilson]] (at the time, a fierce critic of the U.S. system of government) famously wrote \"how is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?\"<ref name=PhD_pp186-187>Wilson, ''Congressional Government'' (1885), pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nAn example is the increase in the [[US public debt|federal debt of the United States]] that occurred during the presidency of Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]. Arguably, the deficits were the product of a bargain between President Reagan and the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[Tip O'Neill]]. O'Neill agreed to tax cuts favored by Reagan, and in exchange Reagan agreed to budgets that did not restrain spending to his liking. In such a scenario, each side can say they are displeased with the debt, plausibly blame the other side for the deficit, and still claim success.\n\n=== Impediments to leadership change ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nAnother alleged problem of presidentialism is that it is often difficult to remove a president from office early. Even if a president is \"proved to be inefficient, even if he becomes unpopular, even if his policy is unacceptable to the majority of his countrymen, he and his methods must be endured until the moment comes for a new election\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> [[John Tyler]] was elected vice president and assumed the presidency because [[William Henry Harrison]] died after thirty days in office. Tyler blocked the Whig agenda, was loathed by his nominal party, but remained firmly in control of the executive branch. Most presidential systems provide no legal means to remove a president simply for being unpopular or even for behaving in a manner that might be considered unethical or immoral provided it is not illegal. This has been cited{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} as the reason why many presidential countries have experienced military coups to remove a leader who is said to have lost his mandate.\n\nParliamentary systems can quickly remove unpopular leaders by a [[vote of no confidence]], a procedure that serves as a \"pressure release valve\" for political tension. Votes of no confidence are easier to achieve in [[minority government]] situations, but even if the unpopular leader heads a [[majority government]], he or she is often in a less secure position than a president. Usually in parliamentary systems a basic premise is that if a premier's popularity sustains a serious enough blow and the premier does not as a matter of consequence offer to resign prior to the next election, then those members of parliament who would persist in supporting the premier will be at serious risk of losing their seats. Therefore, especially in parliaments with a strong party system, other prominent members of the premier's party have a strong incentive to initiate a leadership challenge in hopes of mitigating damage to their party. More often than not, a premier facing a serious challenge resolves to save face by [[resignation|resigning]] before being formally removed\u2014[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s relinquishing of her premiership being a prominent example.\n\nOn the other hand, while removing a president through [[impeachment]] is allowed by most constitutions, impeachment proceedings often can be initiated only in cases where the president has violated the constitution or broken the law. Impeachment is often made difficult; by comparison the removal a party leader is normally governed by the (often less formal) rules of the party. Nearly all parties (including governing parties) have a relatively simple process for removing their leaders.\n\nFurthermore, even when impeachment proceedings against a sitting president are successful, whether by causing his removal from office or by compelling his resignation, the legislature usually has little or no discretion in determining the ousted president's successor, since presidential systems usually adhere to a rigid succession process which is enforced the same way regardless of how a vacancy in the presidency comes about. The usual outcome of a presidency becoming vacant is that a vice president automatically succeeds to the presidency. Vice presidents are usually chosen by the president, whether as a running mate who elected alongside the president or appointed by a sitting president, so that when a vice president succeeds to the presidency it is probable that he will continue many or all the policies of the former president. A prominent example of such an accession would be the elevation of Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] to the U.S. Presidency after [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to resign in the face of virtually certain impeachment and removal, a succession that took place notwithstanding the fact that Ford had only assumed the Vice Presidency after being appointed by Nixon to replace [[Spiro Agnew]], who had also resigned due to scandal. In some cases, particularly when the would-be successor to a presidency is seen by legislators as no better (or even worse) than a president they wish to see removed, there may be a strong incentive to abstain from pursuing impeachment proceedings even if there are legal grounds to do so.\n\nSince prime ministers in parliamentary systems must always retain the confidence of the legislature, in cases where a prime minister suddenly leaves office there is little point in anyone without a reasonable prospect of gaining that legislative confidence attempting to assume the premiership. This ensures that whenever a premiership becomes vacant (or is about to become vacant), legislators from the premier's party will always play a key role in determining the leader's permanent successor. In theory this could be interpreted to support an argument that a parliamentary party ought to have the power to elect their party leader directly, and indeed, at least historically, parliamentary system parties' leadership electoral procedures usually called for the party's legislative caucus to fill a leadership vacancy by electing a new leader directly by and from amongst themselves, and for the whole succession process to be completed within as short a time frame as practical. Today, however, such a system is not commonly practiced and most parliamentary system parties' rules provide for a leadership election in which the general membership of the party is permitted to vote at some point in the process (either directly for the new leader or for delegates who then elect the new leader in a convention), though in many cases the party's legislators are allowed to exercise a disproportionate influence in the final vote.\n\nWhenever a leadership election becomes necessary on account of a vacancy arising suddenly, an interim leader (often informally called the ''interim prime minister'' in cases where this involves a governing party) will be selected by the parliamentary party, usually with the stipulation or expectation that the interim leader will not be a candidate for the permanent leadership. Some parties, such as the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], employ some combination of both aforementioned electoral processes to select a new leader. In any event, a prime minister who is forced to leave office due to scandal or similar circumstance will usually have little if any ability to influence his party on the final selection of a new leader and anyone seen to be having close ties to such a prime minister will have limited if any serious prospect of being elected the new leader. Even in cases when an outgoing prime minister is leaving office voluntarily, it is often frowned on for an outgoing or former premier to engage in any overt attempt to influence the election (for example, by endorsing a candidate in the leadership election), in part because a party in the process of selecting a new leader usually has a strong incentive to foster a competitive leadership election in order to stimulate interest and participation in the election, which in turn encourages the sale of party memberships and support for the party in general.\n\n[[Walter Bagehot]] criticized presidentialism because it does not allow a transfer in power in the event of an emergency.\n\n{{quote|Under a cabinet constitution at a sudden emergency the people can choose a ruler for the occasion. It is quite possible and even likely that he would not be ruler before the occasion. The great qualities, the imperious will, the rapid energy, the eager nature fit for a great crisis are not required\u2014are impediments\u2014in common times. A Lord Liverpool is better in everyday politics than a Chatham\u2014a Louis Philippe far better than a Napoleon. By the structure of the world we want, at the sudden occurrence of a grave tempest, to change the helmsman\u2014to replace the pilot of the calm by the pilot of the storm.\n\nBut under a presidential government you can do nothing of the kind. The American government calls itself a government of the supreme people; but at a quick crisis, the time when a sovereign power is most needed, you cannot find the supreme people. You have got a congress elected for one fixed period, going out perhaps by fixed installments, which cannot be accelerated or retarded\u2014you have a president chosen for a fixed period, and immovable during that period:&nbsp;... there is no elastic element&nbsp;... you have bespoken your government in advance, and whether it is what you want or not, by law you must keep it&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Bagehot\">{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=The Cabinet}}</ref>}}\n\nOpponents{{who|date=August 2012}} of the presidential system note that years later, Bagehot's observation came to life during World War II, when [[Neville Chamberlain]] was replaced with [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nHowever, supporters of the presidential system question the validity of the point. They argue that if presidents were not able to command some considerable level of security in their tenures, their [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandates]] would be worthless. They further counter that republics such as the United States have successfully endured war and other crises without the need to change heads of state. Supporters argue that presidents elected in a time of peace and prosperity have proven themselves perfectly capable of responding effectively to a serious crisis, largely due to their ability to make the necessary appointments to his cabinet and elsewhere in government or by creating new positions to deal with new challenges. One prominent, recent example would be the appointment of a [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.\n\nSome supporters of the presidential system counter that impediments to a leadership change, being that they are little more than an unavoidable consequence of the [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandate]] afforded to a president, are thus a ''strength'' instead of a weakness in times of crisis.  In such times, a prime minister might hesitate due to the need to keep parliament's support, whereas a president can act without fear of removal from office by those who might disapprove of his actions. Furthermore, even if a prime minister does manage to successfully resolve a crisis (or multiple crises), that does not guarantee and he or she will possess the political capital needed to remain in office for a similar, future crisis. Unlike what would be possible in a presidential system, a perceived crisis in the parliamentary system might give disgruntled backbenchers or rivals an opportunity to launch a vexing challenge for a prime minister's leadership.\n\nFinally, many{{who|date=August 2012}} have criticized presidential systems for their alleged slowness to respond to their citizens' needs. Often, the checks and balances make action difficult. [[Walter Bagehot]] said of the American system, \"the executive is crippled by not getting the law it needs, and the legislature is spoiled by having to act without responsibility: the executive becomes unfit for its name, since it cannot execute what it decides on; the legislature is demoralized by liberty, by taking decisions of others [and not itself] will suffer the effects\".<ref name=\"Bagehot\" />\n\nDefenders of presidential systems argue that a parliamentary system operating in a jurisdiction with strong ethnic or sectarian tensions will tend to ignore the interests of minorities or even treat them with contempt \u2013 the first half century of government in [[Northern Ireland]] is often cited as an example \u2013 whereas presidential systems ensure that minority wishes and rights cannot be disregarded, thus preventing a \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\" and vice versa protect the wishes and rights of the majority from abuse by a legislature or an executive that holds a contrary viewpoint especially when there are frequent, scheduled elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} On the other hand, supporters of parliamentary systems contend that the strength and independence of the judiciary is the more decisive factor when it comes to protection of minority rights.\n\nBritish-Irish philosopher and MP [[Edmund Burke]] stated that an official should be elected based on \"his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience\", and therefore should reflect on the arguments for and against certain policies before taking positions and then act out on what an official would believe is best in the long run for one's constituents and country as a whole even if it means short-term backlash. Thus defenders of presidential systems hold that sometimes what is [[Trustee model of representation|wisest may not always be the most popular decision]] and vice versa.\n\n== Differences from a parliamentary system ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nA number of key theoretical differences exist between a presidential and a parliamentary system:\n* In a presidential system, the central principle is that the [[legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]] and judicial branches of government are separate. This leads to the separate election of president, who is elected to office for a fixed term, and only removable for gross misdemeanor by [[impeachment]] and dismissal. By contrast, in [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], the executive branch is led by a council of ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister]], who are directly accountable to the legislature and often have their background in the legislature (regardless of whether it is called a \"parliament\", an \"assembly\", a \"diet\", or a \"chamber\").\n* As with the president's set term of office, the legislature also exists for a set term of office and cannot be dissolved ahead of schedule. By contrast, in parliamentary systems, the prime minister needs to survive a vote of confidence otherwise a new election must be called. The legislature can typically be dissolved at any stage during its life by the head of state, usually on the advice of either Prime Minister alone, by the Prime Minister and cabinet, or by the cabinet.\n* In a presidential system, the president usually has special privileges in the enactment of legislation, namely the possession of a power of [[veto]] over legislation of bills, in some cases subject to the power of the legislature by weighted majority to override the veto. The legislature and the president are thus expected to serve as [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] on each other's powers.\n* Presidential system presidents may also be given a great deal of constitutional authority in the exercise of the office of [[Commander in Chief]], a constitutional title given to most presidents. In addition, the presidential power to receive ambassadors as head of state is usually interpreted as giving the president broad powers to conduct [[foreign policy]]. Though semi-presidential systems may reduce a president's power over day-to-day government affairs, semi-presidential systems commonly give the president power over foreign policy.\n* Parliamentary systems certainly provide greater flexibility in the process of transition to any consolidation of democracy.<ref>Linz, J. (1985) Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference? Connecticut: Yale university press.</ref>\n\nPresidential systems also have fewer ideological parties than parliamentary systems. Sometimes in the United States, the policies preferred by the two parties have been very similar (but ''see also'' [[polarization (politics)|polarization]]). In the 1950s, during the leadership of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Senate Democrats included the [[right-wing politics|right]]-most members of the chamber\u2014[[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]] and [[Strom Thurmond]], and the [[left-wing politics|left]]-most members\u2014[[Paul Douglas]] and [[Herbert Lehman]]. This pattern does not prevail in Latin American presidential democracies.\n\n=== Overlapping elements ===\nIn practice, elements of both systems overlap. Though a president in a presidential system does not have to choose a government under the legislature, the legislature may have the right to scrutinize his or her appointments to high governmental office, with the right, on some occasions, to block an appointment. In the [[United States]], many appointments must be confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], although once confirmed an appointee can only be removed against the president's will through [[impeachment]]. By contrast, though answerable ''to'' parliament, a parliamentary system's cabinet may be able to make use of the parliamentary '[[Whip (politics)|whip]]' (an obligation on party members in parliament to vote with their party) to control and dominate parliament, reducing parliament's ability to control the government.\n\n==Republics with a presidential system of government==\n{{main|List of countries by system of government#Presidential systems}}\n\n''Italics'' indicate states with limited recognition.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{flag|Afghanistan}}\n* {{flag|Angola}}\n* {{flag|Argentina}}\n* {{flag|Benin}}\n* {{flag|Belarus}}\n* {{flag|Bolivia}}\n* {{flag|Brazil}}\n* {{flag|Burundi}}\n* {{flag|Chad}}\n* {{flag|Chile}}\n* {{flag|Colombia}}\n* {{flag|Comoros}}\n* {{flag|Costa Rica}}\n* {{flag|Cyprus}}\n* {{flag|Dominican Republic}}\n* {{flag|Ecuador}}\n* {{flag|El Salvador}}\n* {{flag|Gambia}}\n* {{flag|Ghana}}\n* {{flag|Guatemala}}\n* {{flag|Honduras}}\n* {{flag|Indonesia}}\n* {{flag|Kenya}}\n* {{flag|Liberia}}\n* {{flag|Malawi}}\n* {{flag|Maldives}}\n* {{flag|Mexico}}\n* {{flag|Nicaragua}}\n* {{flag|Nigeria}}\n* {{flag|Palau}}\n* {{flag|Panama}}\n* {{flag|Paraguay}}\n* {{flag|Peru}}\n* {{flag|Philippines}}\n* {{flag|Senegal}}\n* {{flag|Seychelles}}\n* {{flag|Sierra Leone}}\n* {{flag|South Sudan}}\n* {{flag|Turkey}}\n* {{flag|Turkmenistan}}\n* {{flag|United States}}\n* {{flag|Uruguay}}\n* {{flag|Venezuela}}\n* {{flag|Zambia}}\n* {{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Presidential systems with a prime minister===\nThe following countries have presidential systems where a post of [[prime minister]] (official title may vary) exists alongside that of president.

This head of government is in most cases also the [[head of state]], which is called ''[[President (government title)|president]]''\n\nIn presidential countries, the executive is [[Election|elected]] and is not [[Responsible government|responsible]] to the legislature, which cannot in normal circumstances [[Dissolution of parliament|dismiss]] it. Such dismissal is possible, however, in uncommon cases, often through [[impeachment]].\n\nThe title \"[[President (government title)|president]]\" has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body, as with the [[President of the Continental Congress]] in the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|early United States]], prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government.\n\nA presidential system contrasts with a [[parliamentary system]], where the head of government comes to power by gaining the confidence of an elected [[legislature]]. There is also a hybrid system called [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidentialism]].\n\nCountries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president. Heads of state of [[parliamentary republic]]s, largely ceremonial in most cases, are called presidents. [[Dictator]]s or leaders of [[one-party state]]s, whether popularly elected or not, are also often called presidents.\n\nPresidentialism is the dominant form of government in the mainland [[Americas]], with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics, with the exception of [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Belize|Belize]], and [[Politics of Suriname|Suriname]] ([[South America]] is also the only continent in the world to have no monarchies). It is also prevalent in [[Central Africa|Central]] and southern [[West Africa]] and in [[Central Asia]]. There are no presidential republics in Europe (whether nominally or in practice), with the exception for [[politics of Turkey|Turkey]], [[politics of Belarus|Belarus]], France and [[Politics of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. Oceania also has no presidential republics.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIn a full-fledged presidential system, a politician is chosen directly by the public or indirectly by the winning party to be the [[head of government]]. Except for [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]], this head of government is also the [[head of state]], and is therefore called ''president''. The post of [[prime minister]] (also called premier) may also exist in a presidential system, but unlike in [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] or parliamentary systems, the prime minister answers to the president and not to the legislature.\n\nThe following characteristics apply generally for the numerous presidential governments across the world:\n* The executive can [[veto]] legislative acts and, in turn, a [[supermajority]] of lawmakers may override the veto. The veto is generally derived from the [[United Kingdom|British]] tradition of [[royal assent]] in which an act of parliament can only be enacted with the assent of the [[British monarchy|monarch]].\n* The president has a fixed term of office. Elections are held at regular times and cannot be triggered by a [[vote of confidence]] or other parliamentary procedures, although in some countries there is an exception which provides for the removal of a president who is found to have broken a law.\n* The executive branch is unipersonal. Members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] serve at the pleasure of the president and must carry out the policies of the executive and legislative branches. Cabinet ministers or executive departmental chiefs are not members of the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, presidential systems often need legislative approval of executive nominations to the cabinet, [[judicial review|judiciary]], and various lower governmental posts. A president generally can direct members of the cabinet, military, or any officer or employee of the executive branch, but cannot direct or dismiss judges.\n* The president can often [[pardon]] or [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] sentences of convicted criminals.\n\n== Subnational governments of the world ==\n{{See also|State governments of the United States}}\nSubnational governments, usually states, may be structured as presidential systems. All of the state governments in the United States use the presidential system, even though this is not constitutionally required. On a local level, many cities use [[council-manager government]], which is equivalent to a parliamentary system, although the post of a [[city manager]] is normally a non-political position. Some countries without a presidential system at the national level use a form of this system at a subnational or local level. One example is [[Japan]], where the national government uses the parliamentary system, but the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and [[Municipalities of Japan|municipal governments]] have governors and mayors elected independently from local assemblies and councils.\n\n== Advantages ==\nSupporters generally claim four basic advantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Direct elections''' \u2014 in a presidential system, the president is often elected directly by the people. This makes the president's power more legitimate than that of a leader appointed indirectly. However, this is not a necessary feature of a presidential system. Some presidential states have an indirectly elected head of state.\n* '''Separation of powers''' \u2014 a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. This allows each structure to monitor and check the other, preventing abuses of power.\n* '''Speed and decisiveness''' \u2014 A president with strong powers can usually enact changes quickly. However, the separation of powers can also slow the system down.\n* '''Stability''' \u2014 a president, by virtue of a fixed term, may provide more stability than a prime minister, who can be dismissed at any time.\n\n=== Direct elections ===\nIn most presidential systems, the president is elected by popular vote, although some such as the [[United States]] use an [[United States electoral college|electoral college]] (which is itself directly elected) or some other method.<ref>The \"presidential\" model implies that the Chief Executive is elected by all those members of the electoral body: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Titolo V e \"forme di governo\": il caso Abruzzo (dopo la Calabria)|journal= Diritto&Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2003| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89381752}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>  By this method, the president receives a personal mandate to lead the country, whereas in a parliamentary system a candidate might only receive a personal mandate to represent a constituency. That means a president can only be elected independently of the legislative branch.\n\n=== Separation of powers ===\nA presidential system's separation of the executive from the legislature is sometimes held up as an advantage, in that each branch may scrutinize the actions of the other. In a parliamentary system, the executive is drawn from the legislature, making criticism of one by the other considerably less likely. A formal condemnation of the executive by the legislature is often considered a [[vote of no confidence]]. According to supporters of the presidential system, the lack of checks and balances means that misconduct by a prime minister may never be discovered. Writing about [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], [[Woodrow Wyatt]], a former MP in the UK, said \"don't think a Watergate couldn't happen here, you just wouldn't hear about it.\" (ibid)\n\nCritics respond that if a presidential system's legislature is controlled by the president's party, the same situation exists. Proponents{{Who|date=March 2017}} note that even in such a situation a legislator from the president's party is in a better position to criticize the president or his policies should he deem it necessary, since the immediate security of the president's position is less dependent on legislative support. In parliamentary systems, [[party discipline]] is much more strictly enforced. If a parliamentary [[backbencher]] publicly criticizes the executive or its policies to any significant extent then he/she faces a much higher prospect of losing his/her party's nomination, or even outright expulsion from the party. Even mild criticism from a backbencher could carry consequences serious enough (in particular, removal from consideration for a cabinet post) to effectively muzzle a legislator with any serious political ambitions.\n\nDespite the existence of the no confidence vote, in practice it is extremely difficult to stop a prime minister or cabinet that has made its decision. In a parliamentary system, if important legislation proposed by the incumbent prime minister and his cabinet is \"voted down\" by a majority of the members of parliament then it is considered a vote of no confidence. To emphasize that particular point, a prime minister will often declare a particular legislative vote to be a matter of confidence at the first sign of reluctance on the part of legislators from his or her own party. If a government loses a parliamentary vote of confidence, then the incumbent government must then either resign or call elections to be held, a consequence few backbenchers are willing to endure. Hence, a no confidence vote in some parliamentary countries, like Britain, only occurs a few times in a century. In 1931, [[David Lloyd George]] told a select committee: \"Parliament has really no control over the executive; it is a pure fiction.\" (Schlesinger 1982)\n\nBy contrast, if a presidential legislative initiative fails to pass a legislature controlled by the president's party (e.g. the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]] in the United States), it may damage the president's political standing and that of his party, but generally has no immediate effect on whether or not the president completes his term.\n\n=== Speed and decisiveness ===\nSome supporters of presidential systems claim{{Who|date=September 2016}} that presidential systems can respond more rapidly to emerging situations than parliamentary ones. A prime minister, when taking action, needs to retain the support of the legislature, but a president is often less constrained. In ''[[Why England Slept]]'', future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] argued that British prime ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] were constrained by the need to maintain the confidence of the Commons.\n\nOther supporters of presidential systems sometimes argue in the exact opposite direction, however, saying that presidential systems can slow decision-making to beneficial ends. Divided government, where the presidency and the legislature are controlled by different parties, is said to restrain the excesses of both the coalition and opposition, and guarantee cross-partisan input into legislation. In the United States, Republican Congressman [[Bill Frenzel]] wrote in 1995:\n\n{{quote|\"There are some of us who think [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]] is the best thing since indoor plumbing. Gridlock is the natural gift the Framers of the Constitution gave us so that the country would not be subjected to policy swings resulting from the whimsy of the public. And the competition\u2014whether multi-branch, multi-level, or multi-house\u2014is important to those checks and balances and to our ongoing kind of centrist government. Thank heaven we do not have a government that nationalizes one year and privatizes next year, and so on ''ad infinitum''\". (Checks and Balances, 8)}}\n\n=== Stability ===\nAlthough most parliamentary governments go long periods of time without a no confidence vote, [[Italy]], [[Israel]], and the [[French Fourth Republic]] have all experienced difficulties maintaining stability. When parliamentary systems have multiple parties, and governments are forced to rely on coalitions, as they often do in nations that use a system of [[proportional representation]], extremist parties can theoretically use the threat of leaving a coalition to further their agendas.\n\nMany people consider presidential systems more able to survive emergencies. A country under enormous stress may, supporters argue, be better off being led by a president with a fixed term than rotating premierships. [[France]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian controversy]] switched to a [[semi-presidential system]] as did [[Sri Lanka]] during its civil war, while [[Israel]] experimented with a directly elected [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]] in 1992. In France and Sri Lanka, the results are widely considered to have been positive. However, in the case of Israel, an unprecedented proliferation of smaller parties occurred, leading to the restoration of the previous system of selecting a prime minister.\n\nThe fact that elections are fixed in a presidential system is considered by supporters a welcome \"check\" on the powers of the executive, contrasting parliamentary systems, which may allow the prime minister to call elections whenever they see fit or orchestrate their own vote of no confidence to trigger an election when they cannot get a legislative item passed. The presidential model is said to discourage this sort of opportunism, and instead forces the executive to operate within the confines of a term they cannot alter to suit their own needs. <!-- Theoretically, if a president's positions and actions have had a positive impact on their respective country, then it is likely that their party's candidate (possibly the sitting president) will be elected for another term in office. [This, of course, also applies in a parliamentary system.] -->\n\nProponents of the presidential system also argue that stability extends to the cabinets chosen under the system, compared to a parliamentary system where cabinets must be drawn from within the legislative branch.  Under the presidential system, cabinet members can be selected from a much larger pool of potential candidates.  This allows presidents the ability to select cabinet members based as much or more on their ability and competency to lead a particular department as on their loyalty to the president, as opposed to parliamentary cabinets, which might be filled by legislators chosen for no better reason than their perceived loyalty to the prime minister.  Supporters of the presidential system note that parliamentary systems are prone{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} to disruptive \"[[cabinet shuffle]]s\" where legislators are moved between portfolios, whereas in presidential system cabinets (such as the [[United States Cabinet]]), cabinet shuffles are unusual.\n\n== Criticism and disadvantages ==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}}\nCritics generally claim three basic disadvantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Tendency towards authoritarianism''' \u2013 some political scientists say presidentialism raises the stakes of elections, exacerbates their polarization and can lead to authoritarianism (Linz).\n* '''Political gridlock''' \u2013 the separation of powers of a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. Critics argue that this can create an undesirable and long-term [[gridlock (politics)|political gridlock]] whenever the president and the legislative majority are from different parties, which is common because the electorate usually expects more rapid results from new policies than are possible (Linz, Mainwaring and Shugart). In addition, this reduces accountability by allowing the president and the legislature to shift blame to each other.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy, AP* Edition \u2013 2016 Presidential Election, 17th Edition|last=George|first=Edwards|last2=Warrenberg|first2=Martin|publisher=Pearson Higher Education|year=2016|isbn=9780134586571|location=|pages=16}}</ref>\n* '''Impediments to leadership change''' \u2013 presidential systems often make it difficult to remove a president from office early, for example after taking actions that become unpopular.\n\nA fourth criticism applies specifically to nations with a proportionally elected legislature and a presidency. Where the voters are virtually all represented by their votes in the proportional outcome, the presidency is elected on a winner-take-all basis. Two different electoral systems are therefore in play, potentially leading to conflicts that are based on the natural differences of the systems.\n\n=== Tendency towards authoritarianism ===\nA prime minister without majority support in the legislature must either form a coalition or, if able to lead a minority government, govern in a manner acceptable to at least some of the opposition parties. Even with a majority government, the prime minister must still govern within (perhaps unwritten) constraints as determined by the members of his party\u2014a premier in this situation is often at greater risk of losing his party leadership than his party is at risk of losing the next election. On the other hand, winning the presidency is a winner-take-all, [[zero-sum game]]. Once elected, a president might be able to marginalize the influence of other parties and exclude rival factions in his own party as well, or even leave the party whose ticket he was elected under. The president can thus rule without any party support until the next election or abuse his power to win multiple terms, a worrisome situation for many interest groups. Yale political scientist [[Juan Linz]] argues that:\n\n{{quote|The danger that zero-sum presidential elections pose is compounded by the rigidity of the president's fixed term in office. Winners and losers are sharply defined for the entire period of the presidential mandate&nbsp;... losers must wait four or five years without any access to executive power and patronage.

According to political scientist [[Fred Riggs]], presidentialism has fallen into authoritarianism in nearly every country it has been attempted.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1997|title=Presidentialism versus Parliamentarism: Implications for Representativeness and Legitimacy|jstor=1601343|journal=International Political Science Review |volume= 18| issue =  3|page=258|last1=Riggs|first1=Fred W.|doi=10.1177/019251297018003003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=1994|title=Conceptual homogenization of a heterogeneous field: Presidentialism in comparative perspective|journal=Comparing Nations: Concepts, Strategies, Substance|pages=72\u2013152}}</ref> Political sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] pointed out that this has taken place in political cultures not conducive to democracy and that militaries have tended to play a prominent role in most of these countries.

Conflicts between the branches of government might not be reconciled. When president and legislature disagree and government is not working effectively, there is a strong incentive to use extra-constitutional measures to break the deadlock.  Of the [[separation of powers|three common branches]] of government, the executive is in the best position to use extra-constitutional measures, especially when the president is head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the military. By contrast, in a parliamentary system where the often-ceremonial head of state is either a constitutional monarch or (in the case of a parliamentary republic) an experienced and respected figure, given some political emergency there is a good chance that even a ceremonial head of state will be able to use emergency [[reserve powers]] to restrain a head of government acting in an emergency extra-constitutional manner \u2013 this is only possible because the head of state and the head of government are not the same person.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Dana D.

This is common because the electorate often expects more rapid results than are possible from new policies and switches to a different party at the next election.<ref name=\":0\" /> Critics such as [[Juan Linz]], argue that this inherent political instability can cause democracies to fail, as seen in such cases as Brazil and Chile.<ref>Linz, J. (1990). The perils of presidentialism. The journal of democracy, Volume 1(1), pp. 51-69.</ref>\n\n==== Lack of accountability ====\nIn such cases of gridlock, presidential systems are said by critics<ref>Linz, J. (1985). Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference. Connecticut: Yale university press</ref> not to offer voters the kind of accountability seen in parliamentary systems. It is easy for either the president or the legislature to escape blame by shifting it to the other. Describing the United States, former Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]] said \"the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=James|title=Constitutional Reform and Effective Government|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1/page/11 11]}}</ref> Years before becoming President, [[Woodrow Wilson]] (at the time, a fierce critic of the U.S. system of government) famously wrote \"how is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?\"<ref name=PhD_pp186-187>Wilson, ''Congressional Government'' (1885), pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nAn example is the increase in the [[US public debt|federal debt of the United States]] that occurred during the presidency of Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]. Arguably, the deficits were the product of a bargain between President Reagan and the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[Tip O'Neill]]. O'Neill agreed to tax cuts favored by Reagan, and in exchange Reagan agreed to budgets that did not restrain spending to his liking. In such a scenario, each side can say they are displeased with the debt, plausibly blame the other side for the deficit, and still claim success.\n\n=== Impediments to leadership change ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nAnother alleged problem of presidentialism is that it is often difficult to remove a president from office early. Even if a president is \"proved to be inefficient, even if he becomes unpopular, even if his policy is unacceptable to the majority of his countrymen, he and his methods must be endured until the moment comes for a new election\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> [[John Tyler]] was elected vice president and assumed the presidency because [[William Henry Harrison]] died after thirty days in office. Tyler blocked the Whig agenda, was loathed by his nominal party, but remained firmly in control of the executive branch. Most presidential systems provide no legal means to remove a president simply for being unpopular or even for behaving in a manner that might be considered unethical or immoral provided it is not illegal. This has been cited{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} as the reason why many presidential countries have experienced military coups to remove a leader who is said to have lost his mandate.\n\nParliamentary systems can quickly remove unpopular leaders by a [[vote of no confidence]], a procedure that serves as a \"pressure release valve\" for political tension. Votes of no confidence are easier to achieve in [[minority government]] situations, but even if the unpopular leader heads a [[majority government]], he or she is often in a less secure position than a president. Usually in parliamentary systems a basic premise is that if a premier's popularity sustains a serious enough blow and the premier does not as a matter of consequence offer to resign prior to the next election, then those members of parliament who would persist in supporting the premier will be at serious risk of losing their seats. Therefore, especially in parliaments with a strong party system, other prominent members of the premier's party have a strong incentive to initiate a leadership challenge in hopes of mitigating damage to their party. More often than not, a premier facing a serious challenge resolves to save face by [[resignation|resigning]] before being formally removed\u2014[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s relinquishing of her premiership being a prominent example.\n\nOn the other hand, while removing a president through [[impeachment]] is allowed by most constitutions, impeachment proceedings often can be initiated only in cases where the president has violated the constitution or broken the law. Impeachment is often made difficult; by comparison the removal a party leader is normally governed by the (often less formal) rules of the party. Nearly all parties (including governing parties) have a relatively simple process for removing their leaders.\n\nFurthermore, even when impeachment proceedings against a sitting president are successful, whether by causing his removal from office or by compelling his resignation, the legislature usually has little or no discretion in determining the ousted president's successor, since presidential systems usually adhere to a rigid succession process which is enforced the same way regardless of how a vacancy in the presidency comes about. The usual outcome of a presidency becoming vacant is that a vice president automatically succeeds to the presidency. Vice presidents are usually chosen by the president, whether as a running mate who elected alongside the president or appointed by a sitting president, so that when a vice president succeeds to the presidency it is probable that he will continue many or all the policies of the former president. A prominent example of such an accession would be the elevation of Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] to the U.S. Presidency after [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to resign in the face of virtually certain impeachment and removal, a succession that took place notwithstanding the fact that Ford had only assumed the Vice Presidency after being appointed by Nixon to replace [[Spiro Agnew]], who had also resigned due to scandal. In some cases, particularly when the would-be successor to a presidency is seen by legislators as no better (or even worse) than a president they wish to see removed, there may be a strong incentive to abstain from pursuing impeachment proceedings even if there are legal grounds to do so.\n\nSince prime ministers in parliamentary systems must always retain the confidence of the legislature, in cases where a prime minister suddenly leaves office there is little point in anyone without a reasonable prospect of gaining that legislative confidence attempting to assume the premiership. This ensures that whenever a premiership becomes vacant (or is about to become vacant), legislators from the premier's party will always play a key role in determining the leader's permanent successor. In theory this could be interpreted to support an argument that a parliamentary party ought to have the power to elect their party leader directly, and indeed, at least historically, parliamentary system parties' leadership electoral procedures usually called for the party's legislative caucus to fill a leadership vacancy by electing a new leader directly by and from amongst themselves, and for the whole succession process to be completed within as short a time frame as practical. Today, however, such a system is not commonly practiced and most parliamentary system parties' rules provide for a leadership election in which the general membership of the party is permitted to vote at some point in the process (either directly for the new leader or for delegates who then elect the new leader in a convention), though in many cases the party's legislators are allowed to exercise a disproportionate influence in the final vote.\n\nWhenever a leadership election becomes necessary on account of a vacancy arising suddenly, an interim leader (often informally called the ''interim prime minister'' in cases where this involves a governing party) will be selected by the parliamentary party, usually with the stipulation or expectation that the interim leader will not be a candidate for the permanent leadership. Some parties, such as the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], employ some combination of both aforementioned electoral processes to select a new leader. In any event, a prime minister who is forced to leave office due to scandal or similar circumstance will usually have little if any ability to influence his party on the final selection of a new leader and anyone seen to be having close ties to such a prime minister will have limited if any serious prospect of being elected the new leader. Even in cases when an outgoing prime minister is leaving office voluntarily, it is often frowned on for an outgoing or former premier to engage in any overt attempt to influence the election (for example, by endorsing a candidate in the leadership election), in part because a party in the process of selecting a new leader usually has a strong incentive to foster a competitive leadership election in order to stimulate interest and participation in the election, which in turn encourages the sale of party memberships and support for the party in general.\n\n[[Walter Bagehot]] criticized presidentialism because it does not allow a transfer in power in the event of an emergency.\n\n{{quote|Under a cabinet constitution at a sudden emergency the people can choose a ruler for the occasion. It is quite possible and even likely that he would not be ruler before the occasion. The great qualities, the imperious will, the rapid energy, the eager nature fit for a great crisis are not required\u2014are impediments\u2014in common times. A Lord Liverpool is better in everyday politics than a Chatham\u2014a Louis Philippe far better than a Napoleon. By the structure of the world we want, at the sudden occurrence of a grave tempest, to change the helmsman\u2014to replace the pilot of the calm by the pilot of the storm.\n\nBut under a presidential government you can do nothing of the kind. The American government calls itself a government of the supreme people; but at a quick crisis, the time when a sovereign power is most needed, you cannot find the supreme people. You have got a congress elected for one fixed period, going out perhaps by fixed installments, which cannot be accelerated or retarded\u2014you have a president chosen for a fixed period, and immovable during that period:&nbsp;... there is no elastic element&nbsp;... you have bespoken your government in advance, and whether it is what you want or not, by law you must keep it&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Bagehot\">{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=The Cabinet}}</ref>}}\n\nOpponents{{who|date=August 2012}} of the presidential system note that years later, Bagehot's observation came to life during World War II, when [[Neville Chamberlain]] was replaced with [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nHowever, supporters of the presidential system question the validity of the point. They argue that if presidents were not able to command some considerable level of security in their tenures, their [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandates]] would be worthless. They further counter that republics such as the United States have successfully endured war and other crises without the need to change heads of state. Supporters argue that presidents elected in a time of peace and prosperity have proven themselves perfectly capable of responding effectively to a serious crisis, largely due to their ability to make the necessary appointments to his cabinet and elsewhere in government or by creating new positions to deal with new challenges. One prominent, recent example would be the appointment of a [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.\n\nSome supporters of the presidential system counter that impediments to a leadership change, being that they are little more than an unavoidable consequence of the [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandate]] afforded to a president, are thus a ''strength'' instead of a weakness in times of crisis.  In such times, a prime minister might hesitate due to the need to keep parliament's support, whereas a president can act without fear of removal from office by those who might disapprove of his actions. Furthermore, even if a prime minister does manage to successfully resolve a crisis (or multiple crises), that does not guarantee and he or she will possess the political capital needed to remain in office for a similar, future crisis. Unlike what would be possible in a presidential system, a perceived crisis in the parliamentary system might give disgruntled backbenchers or rivals an opportunity to launch a vexing challenge for a prime minister's leadership.\n\nFinally, many{{who|date=August 2012}} have criticized presidential systems for their alleged slowness to respond to their citizens' needs. Often, the checks and balances make action difficult. [[Walter Bagehot]] said of the American system, \"the executive is crippled by not getting the law it needs, and the legislature is spoiled by having to act without responsibility: the executive becomes unfit for its name, since it cannot execute what it decides on; the legislature is demoralized by liberty, by taking decisions of others [and not itself] will suffer the effects\".<ref name=\"Bagehot\" />\n\nDefenders of presidential systems argue that a parliamentary system operating in a jurisdiction with strong ethnic or sectarian tensions will tend to ignore the interests of minorities or even treat them with contempt \u2013 the first half century of government in [[Northern Ireland]] is often cited as an example \u2013 whereas presidential systems ensure that minority wishes and rights cannot be disregarded, thus preventing a \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\" and vice versa protect the wishes and rights of the majority from abuse by a legislature or an executive that holds a contrary viewpoint especially when there are frequent, scheduled elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} On the other hand, supporters of parliamentary systems contend that the strength and independence of the judiciary is the more decisive factor when it comes to protection of minority rights.\n\nBritish-Irish philosopher and MP [[Edmund Burke]] stated that an official should be elected based on \"his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience\", and therefore should reflect on the arguments for and against certain policies before taking positions and then act out on what an official would believe is best in the long run for one's constituents and country as a whole even if it means short-term backlash. Thus defenders of presidential systems hold that sometimes what is [[Trustee model of representation|wisest may not always be the most popular decision]] and vice versa.\n\n== Differences from a parliamentary system ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nA number of key theoretical differences exist between a presidential and a parliamentary system:\n* In a presidential system, the central principle is that the [[legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]] and judicial branches of government are separate. This leads to the separate election of president, who is elected to office for a fixed term, and only removable for gross misdemeanor by [[impeachment]] and dismissal. By contrast, in [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], the executive branch is led by a council of ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister]], who are directly accountable to the legislature and often have their background in the legislature (regardless of whether it is called a \"parliament\", an \"assembly\", a \"diet\", or a \"chamber\").\n* As with the president's set term of office, the legislature also exists for a set term of office and cannot be dissolved ahead of schedule. By contrast, in parliamentary systems, the prime minister needs to survive a vote of confidence otherwise a new election must be called. The legislature can typically be dissolved at any stage during its life by the head of state, usually on the advice of either Prime Minister alone, by the Prime Minister and cabinet, or by the cabinet.\n* In a presidential system, the president usually has special privileges in the enactment of legislation, namely the possession of a power of [[veto]] over legislation of bills, in some cases subject to the power of the legislature by weighted majority to override the veto. The legislature and the president are thus expected to serve as [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] on each other's powers.\n* Presidential system presidents may also be given a great deal of constitutional authority in the exercise of the office of [[Commander in Chief]], a constitutional title given to most presidents. In addition, the presidential power to receive ambassadors as head of state is usually interpreted as giving the president broad powers to conduct [[foreign policy]]. Though semi-presidential systems may reduce a president's power over day-to-day government affairs, semi-presidential systems commonly give the president power over foreign policy.\n* Parliamentary systems certainly provide greater flexibility in the process of transition to any consolidation of democracy.<ref>Linz, J. (1985) Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference? Connecticut: Yale university press.</ref>\n\nPresidential systems also have fewer ideological parties than parliamentary systems. Sometimes in the United States, the policies preferred by the two parties have been very similar (but ''see also'' [[polarization (politics)|polarization]]). In the 1950s, during the leadership of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Senate Democrats included the [[right-wing politics|right]]-most members of the chamber\u2014[[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]] and [[Strom Thurmond]], and the [[left-wing politics|left]]-most members\u2014[[Paul Douglas]] and [[Herbert Lehman]]. This pattern does not prevail in Latin American presidential democracies.\n\n=== Overlapping elements ===\nIn practice, elements of both systems overlap. Though a president in a presidential system does not have to choose a government under the legislature, the legislature may have the right to scrutinize his or her appointments to high governmental office, with the right, on some occasions, to block an appointment. In the [[United States]], many appointments must be confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], although once confirmed an appointee can only be removed against the president's will through [[impeachment]]. By contrast, though answerable ''to'' parliament, a parliamentary system's cabinet may be able to make use of the parliamentary '[[Whip (politics)|whip]]' (an obligation on party members in parliament to vote with their party) to control and dominate parliament, reducing parliament's ability to control the government.\n\n==Republics with a presidential system of government==\n{{main|List of countries by system of government#Presidential systems}}\n\n''Italics'' indicate states with limited recognition.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{flag|Afghanistan}}\n* {{flag|Angola}}\n* {{flag|Argentina}}\n* {{flag|Benin}}\n* {{flag|Belarus}}\n* {{flag|Bolivia}}\n* {{flag|Brazil}}\n* {{flag|Burundi}}\n* {{flag|Chad}}\n* {{flag|Chile}}\n* {{flag|Colombia}}\n* {{flag|Comoros}}\n* {{flag|Costa Rica}}\n* {{flag|Cyprus}}\n* {{flag|Dominican Republic}}\n* {{flag|Ecuador}}\n* {{flag|El Salvador}}\n* {{flag|Gambia}}\n* {{flag|Ghana}}\n* {{flag|Guatemala}}\n* {{flag|Honduras}}\n* {{flag|Indonesia}}\n* {{flag|Kenya}}\n* {{flag|Liberia}}\n* {{flag|Malawi}}\n* {{flag|Maldives}}\n* {{flag|Mexico}}\n* {{flag|Nicaragua}}\n* {{flag|Nigeria}}\n* {{flag|Palau}}\n* {{flag|Panama}}\n* {{flag|Paraguay}}\n* {{flag|Peru}}\n* {{flag|Philippines}}\n* {{flag|Senegal}}\n* {{flag|Seychelles}}\n* {{flag|Sierra Leone}}\n* {{flag|South Sudan}}\n* {{flag|Turkey}}\n* {{flag|Turkmenistan}}\n* {{flag|United States}}\n* {{flag|Uruguay}}\n* {{flag|Venezuela}}\n* {{flag|Zambia}}\n* {{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Presidential systems with a prime minister===\nThe following countries have presidential systems where a post of [[prime minister]] (official title may vary) exists alongside that of president.

In these cases, instances of direct aggression toward inter-specific infants in addition to infanticide have also been observed. In these instances of direct aggression, the aggressor was the previous target of intra-species aggression directed towards them.

Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition.

Although commonly used in the context of food or shelter, the resource competition model can be applied to other limited resources, such as breeding opportunities or access to helpers. Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition. In most observed cases in common marmosets, the socially dominant breeding females killed the infants of a subordinate female, allowing them to maintain their dominance.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Paternal Infanticide ====\nPaternal infanticide is rarely observed in non-human primates. In an extensive study of wild Japanese macaques which tracked instances of infanticide, DNA analysis revealed that males would not attack their own offspring or offspring of a female with whom they mated. Further, females in the study were found to be motivated to form social bonds with males in order to protect them from infanticide.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Social Pathology: Role of Social Organization ===\nIn mammals, interaction between the sexes is usually limited to the female [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] or copulation. However, in non-human primates, these male-female bonds persist past the estrous.

These strategies include physical defense, paternity confusion, reproduction suppression, and accelerated development.\n\n=== Physical Defense ===\n\nThe most immediate and obvious form of protection against infanticide is physical defense wherein mothers either directly prevent aggressive acts toward their offspring or recruit other individuals for assistance.

In these pairs, the males will mate with other females but live exclusively with one female as a socially monogamous pair. Forming this socially monogamous pair causes the males to form parental relationships and social bonds with the female's offspring. These bonds motivate males to defend their offspring against infanticide from unrelated individuals and to never commit infanticide against their own offspring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Opie|first=Christopher|last2=Atkinson|first2=Quentin D.|last3=Dunbar|first3=Robin I.

There are several ways this is accomplished including [[concealed ovulation]].

The Warhouse Gym is their commercial gym following the creation of their personal gym known as The Warehouse.

The Warhouse gym is a state of the art training facility featuring top of the line equipment brands such as Rogue, Nebula, Legend, Prime Steel, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Life Fitness and several custom made pieces. The WHG is open 365 days of the year and host events such as the Veterans Outreach Workout (VOW).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Warhouse Gym |url=https://thewarhousegym.com/ |website=TheWarhouseGym.com}}</ref>\n\nDana Linn Bailey (DLB), has made countless appearances since competing in events such as the Fit Expo and guest poses at the Flex Lewis Classic.

Flag Nor Fail apparel has evolved with its owners to cater to more than just the fitness community but to the outdoorsmen community. They have expanded to a larger warehouse since its creation and now ships worldwide to cater large fan base.

Nov 2008]]\n[[File:Calvert Cemetery Plaque Nov 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Calvert Cemetery plaque in Riverdale, Maryland, one of the founders of what is now the University of Maryland, College Park. ''Nov 2008'']]\n[[File:Riverdale House Museum, Riverdale, Maryland 001.JPG|thumb|Riverdale House Museum, showcases life in historic Riverdale, Maryland. Ben Jacobson (Kranar Drogin)]]\nRiverdale Park and the neighboring community of West Riverdale developed in the late 19th century as streetcar suburbs in central Prince George\u2019s County. The town is located approximately seven miles northeast of downtown [[Washington, D.C.]], and is bounded to the north by [[Maryland Route 410|East-West Highway]]. The area is also bisected by the heavily traveled Baltimore Avenue ([[U.S. Route 1]]). The city of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] is located to the north, the town of [[University Park, Maryland|University Park]] to the east across Baltimore Avenue, and [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville]] is located to the south and southwest.\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe area was first developed in 1801 when a [[Belgium|Belgian]] aristocrat, Henri Joseph Stier, purchased 800 acres situated between two tributaries of the [[Anacostia River]], known as the [[Paint Branch|Paint]] and [[Northwest Branch Anacostia River|Northwest]] branches. Stier and his family moved to the United States several years earlier to escape the [[French Revolution]] (1788\u20131789). Upon purchase, he named his holdings [[Riversdale (Riverdale Park, Maryland)|Riversdale]], and began constructing his residence that same year. The mansion was modeled after the Stier family\u2019s Belgian home, Chateau du Mick, and when completed in 1807, the building stood as a two-story [[stucco|stuccoed-brick]] dwelling in the style of late [[Georgian architecture]].\n\nJust two years after purchasing the property, in 1803, the political tension that had caused Stier to flee his native country subsided, and he and his wife, Marie Louise, returned to Belgium. Riversdale was given to their daughter, [[Rosalie Stier Calvert|Rosalie]], who had married [[George Calvert (planter)|George Calvert]], the grandson of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], in 1799. After Rosalie Stier Calvert died in 1821 and George Calvert in 1838, their son, [[Charles Benedict Calvert]], took over the plantation. Charles Calvert was a renowned agriculturist and helped establish the Maryland Agricultural College, now the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland at College Park]].  In May 1853, Calvert announced he would donate land for an agricultural college.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743\u20131900|page=129|author=Laura Rice}}</ref> In 1861, Calvert was elected to the United States Congress and fought for the establishment of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. During his life, Charles Calvert conducted a variety of agricultural experiments at Riversdale, and expanded his family's original holdings to 2,200 acres. Calvert died in 1864; however, the property remained in the ownership of the Calvert family for another twenty years.\n\nThe 1861 Martenet map depicts the rural setting of Riversdale and identifies Charles B. Calvert as its owner. The old Baltimore Turnpike, now known as [[U.S. Route 1|US Route 1]], is located to the west of the mansion house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/map_item.pl?data=/home/www/data/gmd/gmd384/g3843/g3843p/la000302.jp2&style=gmd&itemLink=r?ammem/gmd:@field(NUMBER+@band(g3843p+la000302))&title=Martenet's+Map+of+Prince+George's+County,+Maryland|title=LC Zoom Viewer  \u2013 Martenet's Map of Prince George's County, Maryland|website=memory.loc.gov|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> To the east of the house is the Washington Branch of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]], which opened in 1833. The railway is located inside the boundaries of Riverdale Park, just west of the Paint Branch tributary. The 1878 Hopkins map depicts little development having had happened since 1861.\n\n===Post-Calverts===\n\nIn 1887, the heirs of [[Charles Benedict Calvert]] sold 474 acres of land to New York City businessmen John Fox and Alexander Lutz in two separate transactions. The first deed involved the sale of 300 acres, which included the Riversdale mansion. The remaining 174 acres were transferred to Fox and Lutz shortly thereafter. The cost of the sales to Fox and Lutz totaled $47,000. On March 23, 1889, Fox and Lutz formed the Riverdale Park Company, which was named in honor of the grand [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] mansion at the center of the proposed community. The company planned on creating an upper-middle-class residential suburb for people working in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.\n\nThe land was platted in 1889 by surveyor D.J. Howell and the new development was named Riverdale Park. In an attempt to differentiate the historic plantation known as Riversdale from the subdivision, the \"s\" was dropped. The new roads were named in honor of United States presidents and were arranged in a grid pattern that surrounded a central ellipse, which served as the site of the commuter train station. The first of the stations was constructed in 1890.  Laid out as a \"villa park\", the community featured traffic circles and green space, with the mansion being used as its central amenity. The three original sections of the suburb utilized relatively uniform lot dimensions and building setbacks, thereby creating a cohesive development of middle- and upper-middle-class housing. The residential housing lots surrounded the high-style Riversdale mansion.\n\n===Growth===\n\nThe construction of dwellings in Riverdale Park began in 1890. The buildings reflected popular architectural trends of the time and were of wood-frame construction. Some structures were pyramidal-roof [[American Foursquare|Foursquares]], while others had front-gable or cross-gable roofs. Many houses from this period have projecting bays, corner towers, and wrap-around porches. By the turn of the twentieth century, Riverdale Park comprised 60 dwellings, a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, a schoolhouse, and a railroad station. The new community straddled the Washington line of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]], which provided residents an easy commute to Washington, D.C.\n\nRecognizing the financial potential of the new suburb, builders purchased groups of lots that were soon improved by high-style single-family dwellings. Joseph A. Blundon (ca. 1847\u20131909) was one such late-nineteenth-century builder. Born in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], Blundon worked as a general contractor in Washington, D.C., before moving to Riverdale Park in 1889. He was instrumental in forming the Riverdale Park Company and served as its first manager. Blundon also, independent of the development company, purchased several lots each year for the purpose of overseeing the construction of single-family dwellings. Between 1891 and 1909, he was responsible for the erection of roughly 90 buildings in Riverdale Park. Accordingly, he became known as the \"Father of Riverdale\".\n\nIn 1920, a handful of owners in both Riverdale Park and the nearby West Riverdale petitioned the [[Maryland General Assembly]] requesting authority to incorporate the two neighborhoods as a municipality. On June 14, 1920, the two communities were incorporated as the Town of Riverdale. As a result of the transfer of power from the Riverdale Park Company to the municipal government, the importance of the real estate company began to diminish, prompting a financial strain. Within ten years of the town\u2019s incorporation, the Riverdale Park Company went bankrupt.\n[[File:Carla Hall Oct 09.JPG|thumb|Carla Hall preparing gourmet natural food at the Riverdale Park Farmers Market, October 2009]] Numerous annexations in the mid-twentieth century increased Riverdale\u2019s overall size. The municipal government continued to grow and change during this period. In 1941, the town changed the name of its roads to conform to the standards of the [[United States Postal Service]], carrying a similar pattern as those of Washington, D.C., and nearby College Park. The increasing population and commercial and governmental growth of metropolitan Washington, D.C., most notably during the last twenty years of the twentieth century, has resulted in further development of the town of Riverdale. This late-twentieth-century growth was predominantly commercial and centered along Baltimore Avenue, thereby physically and visually separating West Riverdale from Riverdale Park.\n\n=== Post-1940s ===\nSince the 1940s, the area has been a largely blue-collar town predominated by small red brick or wooden homes with porches. The area has always had a large presence of [[University System of Maryland|University of Maryland]] students, faculty, and staff residents. It also has a large and growing, professional, middle-class African American population.\n\nThe area originally had its own small town Maryland identity, but was eventually engulfed by post-World War II urban expansion, related to the growth of the University of Maryland and Washington D.C. The area is now much more of a neighborhood than an actual town. Although many of the original residents have left, there are still a significant number of original residents living in the area. Many of the original residents speak with classic Maryland accents, which has some similarities to a Baltimore accent. Washington D.C. and its close northern and northwestern suburbs once had large blue-collar Irish populations some of this influence is still evident in the remnants of the older community.[[File:Leland Hospital Sept 09.JPG|thumb|Leland Hospital, historic architecture in Riverdale Maryland. ''September 2009'']]\nRiverdale also once had a large [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter-cultural]] population, dating back to the 1960s, with many group houses and some small counter-cultural businesses and organizations present in the town. This community maintains a small but existing presence in the area.[[File:Riverdale Presbyterian Church Nov 08.JPG|thumb|Historic Riverdale Presbyterian Church ''Nov 08'']]\nIn 1998, the town was officially renamed Riverdale Park. Today, the town is made up of a mix of housing styles, including 1960s apartment buildings, pre- and post-World War II era buildings, and dwellings from the turn of the twentieth century. The Riversdale mansion, now surrounded by eight acres, is owned by the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission|M-NCPPC]], which purchased it in 1949. The Riversdale property is bounded roughly by 48th Avenue to the west, Riverdale Road to the north, Taylor Street to the east, and Oglethorpe Street to the south.\n[[File:Riverdale Park Station.jpg|thumb|Riverdale Park Station, a mixed use development, located at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue (6700 block) and Van Buren Street, opened in April 2017]]\n\nIn 2015, construction began on the Cafritz Property, the largest piece of undeveloped property in Prince George's County. In April 2017, it opened as Riverdale Park Station, a mixed-use development located at the odd side of the 6600 to 6700 blocks on Baltimore Avenue. A major tenant of the development is the [[Whole Foods Market]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 1533\n|1940= 2330\n|1950= 5530\n|1960= 4389\n|1970= 5724\n|1980= 4761\n|1990= 5185\n|2000= 6690\n|2010= 6956\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7225\n|estref=<ref name=\"census.gov\">https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/riverdaleparktownmaryland/PST045218</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2000 census===\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 6,690 people, 2,172 households, and 1,437 families residing in the town.

family at that time and were very influential in historic Riverdale. Nov 2008]]\n[[File:Calvert Cemetery Plaque Nov 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Calvert Cemetery plaque in Riverdale, Maryland, one of the founders of what is now the University of Maryland, College Park. ''Nov 2008'']]\n[[File:Riverdale House Museum, Riverdale, Maryland 001.JPG|thumb|Riverdale House Museum, showcases life in historic Riverdale, Maryland. Ben Jacobson (Kranar Drogin)]]\nRiverdale Park and the neighboring community of West Riverdale developed in the late 19th century as streetcar suburbs in central Prince George\u2019s County. The town is located approximately seven miles northeast of downtown [[Washington, D.C.]], and is bounded to the north by [[Maryland Route 410|East-West Highway]]. The area is also bisected by the heavily traveled Baltimore Avenue ([[U.S. Route 1]]). The city of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] is located to the north, the town of [[University Park, Maryland|University Park]] to the east across Baltimore Avenue, and [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville]] is located to the south and southwest.\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe area was first developed in 1801 when a [[Belgium|Belgian]] aristocrat, Henri Joseph Stier, purchased 800 acres situated between two tributaries of the [[Anacostia River]], known as the [[Paint Branch|Paint]] and [[Northwest Branch Anacostia River|Northwest]] branches. Stier and his family moved to the United States several years earlier to escape the [[French Revolution]] (1788\u20131789). Upon purchase, he named his holdings [[Riversdale (Riverdale Park, Maryland)|Riversdale]], and began constructing his residence that same year. The mansion was modeled after the Stier family\u2019s Belgian home, Chateau du Mick, and when completed in 1807, the building stood as a two-story [[stucco|stuccoed-brick]] dwelling in the style of late [[Georgian architecture]].\n\nJust two years after purchasing the property, in 1803, the political tension that had caused Stier to flee his native country subsided, and he and his wife, Marie Louise, returned to Belgium. Riversdale was given to their daughter, [[Rosalie Stier Calvert|Rosalie]], who had married [[George Calvert (planter)|George Calvert]], the grandson of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], in 1799. After Rosalie Stier Calvert died in 1821 and George Calvert in 1838, their son, [[Charles Benedict Calvert]], took over the plantation. Charles Calvert was a renowned agriculturist and helped establish the Maryland Agricultural College, now the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland at College Park]].  In May 1853, Calvert announced he would donate land for an agricultural college.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743\u20131900|page=129|author=Laura Rice}}</ref> In 1861, Calvert was elected to the United States Congress and fought for the establishment of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. During his life, Charles Calvert conducted a variety of agricultural experiments at Riversdale, and expanded his family's original holdings to 2,200 acres. Calvert died in 1864; however, the property remained in the ownership of the Calvert family for another twenty years.\n\nThe 1861 Martenet map depicts the rural setting of Riversdale and identifies Charles B. Calvert as its owner. The old Baltimore Turnpike, now known as [[U.S. Route 1|US Route 1]], is located to the west of the mansion house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/map_item.pl?data=/home/www/data/gmd/gmd384/g3843/g3843p/la000302.jp2&style=gmd&itemLink=r?ammem/gmd:@field(NUMBER+@band(g3843p+la000302))&title=Martenet's+Map+of+Prince+George's+County,+Maryland|title=LC Zoom Viewer  \u2013 Martenet's Map of Prince George's County, Maryland|website=memory.loc.gov|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> To the east of the house is the Washington Branch of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]], which opened in 1833. The railway is located inside the boundaries of Riverdale Park, just west of the Paint Branch tributary. The 1878 Hopkins map depicts little development having had happened since 1861.\n\n===Post-Calverts===\n\nIn 1887, the heirs of [[Charles Benedict Calvert]] sold 474 acres of land to New York City businessmen John Fox and Alexander Lutz in two separate transactions. The first deed involved the sale of 300 acres, which included the Riversdale mansion. The remaining 174 acres were transferred to Fox and Lutz shortly thereafter. The cost of the sales to Fox and Lutz totaled $47,000. On March 23, 1889, Fox and Lutz formed the Riverdale Park Company, which was named in honor of the grand [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] mansion at the center of the proposed community. The company planned on creating an upper-middle-class residential suburb for people working in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.\n\nThe land was platted in 1889 by surveyor D.J. Howell and the new development was named Riverdale Park. In an attempt to differentiate the historic plantation known as Riversdale from the subdivision, the \"s\" was dropped. The new roads were named in honor of United States presidents and were arranged in a grid pattern that surrounded a central ellipse, which served as the site of the commuter train station. The first of the stations was constructed in 1890.  Laid out as a \"villa park\", the community featured traffic circles and green space, with the mansion being used as its central amenity. The three original sections of the suburb utilized relatively uniform lot dimensions and building setbacks, thereby creating a cohesive development of middle- and upper-middle-class housing. The residential housing lots surrounded the high-style Riversdale mansion.\n\n===Growth===\n\nThe construction of dwellings in Riverdale Park began in 1890. The buildings reflected popular architectural trends of the time and were of wood-frame construction. Some structures were pyramidal-roof [[American Foursquare|Foursquares]], while others had front-gable or cross-gable roofs. Many houses from this period have projecting bays, corner towers, and wrap-around porches. By the turn of the twentieth century, Riverdale Park comprised 60 dwellings, a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, a schoolhouse, and a railroad station. The new community straddled the Washington line of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]], which provided residents an easy commute to Washington, D.C.\n\nRecognizing the financial potential of the new suburb, builders purchased groups of lots that were soon improved by high-style single-family dwellings. Joseph A. Blundon (ca. 1847\u20131909) was one such late-nineteenth-century builder. Born in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], Blundon worked as a general contractor in Washington, D.C., before moving to Riverdale Park in 1889. He was instrumental in forming the Riverdale Park Company and served as its first manager. Blundon also, independent of the development company, purchased several lots each year for the purpose of overseeing the construction of single-family dwellings. Between 1891 and 1909, he was responsible for the erection of roughly 90 buildings in Riverdale Park. Accordingly, he became known as the \"Father of Riverdale\".\n\nIn 1920, a handful of owners in both Riverdale Park and the nearby West Riverdale petitioned the [[Maryland General Assembly]] requesting authority to incorporate the two neighborhoods as a municipality. On June 14, 1920, the two communities were incorporated as the Town of Riverdale. As a result of the transfer of power from the Riverdale Park Company to the municipal government, the importance of the real estate company began to diminish, prompting a financial strain. Within ten years of the town\u2019s incorporation, the Riverdale Park Company went bankrupt.\n[[File:Carla Hall Oct 09.JPG|thumb|Carla Hall preparing gourmet natural food at the Riverdale Park Farmers Market, October 2009]] Numerous annexations in the mid-twentieth century increased Riverdale\u2019s overall size. The municipal government continued to grow and change during this period. In 1941, the town changed the name of its roads to conform to the standards of the [[United States Postal Service]], carrying a similar pattern as those of Washington, D.C., and nearby College Park. The increasing population and commercial and governmental growth of metropolitan Washington, D.C., most notably during the last twenty years of the twentieth century, has resulted in further development of the town of Riverdale. This late-twentieth-century growth was predominantly commercial and centered along Baltimore Avenue, thereby physically and visually separating West Riverdale from Riverdale Park.\n\n=== Post 1940s ===\nSince the 1940s, the area has been a largely blue-collar town predominated by small red brick or wooden homes with porches. The area has always had a large presence of [[University System of Maryland|University of Maryland]] students, faculty, and staff residents. It also has a large and growing, professional, middle-class African American population.\n\nThe area originally had its own small town Maryland identity, but was eventually engulfed by post-World War II urban expansion, related to the growth of the University of Maryland and Washington D.C. The area is now much more of a neighborhood than an actual town. Although many of the original residents have left, there are still a significant number of original residents living in the area. Many of the original residents speak with classic Maryland accents, which has some similarities to a Baltimore accent. Washington D.C. and its close northern and northwestern suburbs once had large blue-collar Irish populations some of this influence is still evident in the remnants of the older community.[[File:Leland Hospital Sept 09.JPG|thumb|Leland Hospital, historic architecture in Riverdale Maryland. ''September 2009'']]\nRiverdale also once had a large [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter-cultural]] population, dating back to the 1960s, with many group houses and some small counter-cultural businesses and organizations present in the town. This community maintains a small but existing presence in the area.[[File:Riverdale Presbyterian Church Nov 08.JPG|thumb|Historic Riverdale Presbyterian Church ''Nov 08'']]\nIn 1998, the town was officially renamed Riverdale Park. Today, the town is made up of a mix of housing styles, including 1960s apartment buildings, pre- and post-World War II era buildings, and dwellings from the turn of the twentieth century. The Riversdale mansion, now surrounded by eight acres, is owned by the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission|M-NCPPC]], which purchased it in 1949. The Riversdale property is bounded roughly by 48th Avenue to the west, Riverdale Road to the north, Taylor Street to the east, and Oglethorpe Street to the south.\n[[File:Riverdale Park Station.jpg|thumb|Riverdale Park Station, a mixed use development, located at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue (6700 block) and Van Buren Street, opened in April 2017]]\n\nIn 2015, construction began on the Cafritz Property, the largest piece of undeveloped property in Prince George's County. In April 2017, it opened as Riverdale Park Station, a mixed-use development located at the odd side of the 6600 to 6700 blocks on Baltimore Avenue. A major tenant of the development is the [[Whole Foods Market]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 1533\n|1940= 2330\n|1950= 5530\n|1960= 4389\n|1970= 5724\n|1980= 4761\n|1990= 5185\n|2000= 6690\n|2010= 6956\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7225\n|estref=<ref name=\"census.gov\">https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/riverdaleparktownmaryland/PST045218</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2000 census===\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 6,690 people, 2,172 households, and 1,437 families residing in the town.
