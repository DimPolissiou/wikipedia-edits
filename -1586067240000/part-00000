The second child of Hermann and Pauline, their daughter Maria (called [[Maja Einstein|Maja]]), was born in Munich on 18 November 1881. Pauline Einstein was a well-educated and quiet woman who had an inclination for the arts. She was a talented and dedicated piano player. She made Albert begin with violin lessons at the age of five.<ref>Botstein, Leon; Galison, Peter; Holton, Gerald James; Schweber, Silvan S.

Hermann, Maria and Pauline moved to [[Milan]] in the same year and one year later, moved to Pavia. Albert stayed with relatives in Munich to continue his education there. \nUnfortunately, the business was unsuccessful and the brothers had to abandon their factory in 1896. Though Hermann had lost most of his money, he founded (without his brother) another electrical engineering company in Milan. This time business was better. However, Hermann's health had deteriorated, and he died of heart failure in Milan on 10 October 1902.\n\n=== After Hermann ===\n\nIn 1903, Pauline went to live with her sister Fanny and her husband Rudolf Einstein, a first cousin of Hermann, in Hechingen, W\u00fcrttemberg. Fanny's daughter, [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa]] was to become the second wife of Albert in 1919.\nIn 1910, Pauline moved with her sister, Fanny and her family to Berlin. She took on a job as housekeeper in [[Heilbronn]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1911. She lived with her brother Jacob Koch in [[Zurich]] and since 1915 in Heilbronn again.\n\n=== Death ===\nDuring World War I, Pauline fell ill with cancer. In 1918, when visiting her daughter, Maria, and son-in-law, Paul Winteler, in Luzern, Pauline was taken to the sanatorium Rosenau, due to her illness. At the end of 1919, Albert took his terminally-ill mother out of the sanatorium in [[Luzern]] and brought her to Haberlandstrasse 5, Berlin, to stay with him and his second wife, Elsa, where she later died.\n\n==Hermann Einstein (Albert's father)==\n{{anchor|Hermann Einstein|Father}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name           = Hermann Einstein\n|image          = Hermann einstein.jpg\n|birth_date     = {{Birth date|df=yes|1847|8|30}}\n|birth_place    = [[Bad Buchau|Buchau]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|death_date     = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1902|10|10|1847|8|30}}\n|death_place    = [[Milan]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]\n|citizenship    = Subject of Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg (1847\u20131894) <br> Subject of Kingdom of Italy (1894\u20131902) \n|occupation     = Scientific utility salesman, electrician\n|spouse         = [[Einstein family#Pauline Koch (Albert's mother)|Pauline Koch]]\n|parents        = [[Abraham Einstein]] <br> [[Helene Moos]] \n|children       = [[Albert Einstein]] <br> [[Maja Einstein]]\n|relatives  = [[Hans Albert Einstein]] <small>(grandson)</small><br>[[Einstein family#Lieserl Einstein (Albert's daughter)|Lieserl Einstein]] <small>(granddaughter)</small><br>[[Einstein family#Eduard \"Tete\" Einstein (Albert's second son)|Eduard Einstein]] <small>(grandson)</small>\n}}\n'''Hermann Einstein''' (30 August 1847 \u2013 10 October 1902) was the father of [[Albert Einstein]].

He had a strong affection for [[mathematics]], and would have liked to study in this or a related area, but as the financial situation of the family precluded further education, he decided to become a merchant and began an apprenticeship in Stuttgart.\n\n=== Marriage to Pauline ===\n\nHermann married 18-year-old [[Einstein family#Pauline Koch (Albert's mother)|Pauline Koch]] in [[Cannstatt]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] on 8 August 1876. After their wedding, the young couple lived in [[Ulm]], where Hermann became joint partner in the feather bed shop of his cousins, Moses and Hermann Levi. In [[Ulm]], their eldest son [[Albert Einstein|Albert]] was born on 14 March 1879. On the initiative of Hermann's brother Jakob, the family moved to Munich in the summer of 1880. There, the two brothers founded the electrical engineering company ''Einstein & Cie'', with Hermann being the merchant and Jakob the technician. The second child of Hermann and Pauline, their daughter Maria (called [[Maja Einstein|Maja]]), was born in [[Munich]] on 18 November 1881.\n\n=== Work ===\nThe Einsteins' electrical firm manufactured [[dynamo]]s and electrical [[Electricity meter|meters]] based on [[direct current]]. They were instrumental in bringing electricity to Munich. In 1885, they won the contract that provided DC lights to illuminate the [[Oktoberfest]] for the first time.\n\nIn 1893 the Einstein brothers lost a bid on a contract for the electrification of Munich to Schukert, Hermann and Jakob's small company lacked the capital to convert their equipment over from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard being used by Schukert.<ref>Barry R. Parker, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books - 2003, page 31</ref> Their fortunes took a downward turn from there. They were forced to sell their Munich factory and, in search of business, the two brothers moved their company to [[Pavia]], Italy in 1894. Hermann, Pauline and Maja moved to Milan in the same year and one year later moved to [[Pavia]]. Albert stayed with relatives in Munich to continue his education there.\n\nDue to poor business, Hermann and Jakob had to abandon their factory in 1896.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.einstein-website.de/biographies/print/p_hermann.html |title=Short life history: Hermann Einstein |access-date=10 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108233735/http://www.einstein-website.de/biographies/print/p_hermann.html |archive-date=8 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though Hermann had lost most of their money, he founded another electrical engineering company in [[Milan]], this time without his brother.

In their letters, they called the unborn child \"Lieserl\", when referring to a girl, or \"Hanserl\", if a boy. Both \"Lieserl\" and \"Hanserl\" were diminutives of the common German names [[Liese (given name)|Liese]] (short for Elizabeth) and [[Hans (name)|Hans]].\n\nThe first reference to Mari\u0107's pregnancy was found in a letter Einstein wrote to her from [[Winterthur]], probably on 28 May 1901 (letter 36), asking twice about \"the boy\" and \"our little son\",<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 54</ref> whereas Mari\u0107's first reference was found in her letter of 13 November 1901 (letter 43) from [[Stein am Rhein]], in which she referred to the unborn child as \"Lieserl\".<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 63</ref> Einstein goes along with Mari\u0107's wish for a daughter, and referred to the unborn child as \"Lieserl\" as well, but with a sense of humour as in letter 45 of 12 December 1901 \"... and be happy about our Lieserl, whom I secretly (so Dollie<ref>the english translation of the german \"Doxerl\", one of the names Einstein used for Mari\u0107</ref> doesn't notice) prefer to imagine a Hanserl.\"<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 66</ref>\n\nThe child must have been born shortly before 4 February 1902, when Einstein wrote: \"... now you see that it really is a Lieserl, just as you'd wished. Is she healthy and does she cry properly? [...] I love her so much and don't even know her yet!\"<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 73</ref>\n\nThe last time \"Lieserl\" was mentioned in their extant correspondence was in Einstein's letter of 19 September 1903 (letter 54), in which he showed concern that she had [[scarlet fever]]. His asking \"as what is the child registered? [Adding] we must take precautions that problems don't arise for her later\" may indicate the intention to give the child up for adoption.<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 78</ref>\n\nAs neither the full name, nor the fate of the child are known, so far several hypotheses about her life and death have been put forward:\n\n*Michele Zackheim, in her book on \"Lieserl\", ''Einstein's Daughter'', states that \"Lieserl\" was [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]], and that she lived with her mother's family and probably died of scarlet fever in September 1903.<ref>[http://www.einstein-website.de/biographies/einsteinlieserl.html ''Lieserl Einstein's biography'']</ref>\n*Another possibility, favoured by Robert Schulmann of the ''Einstein Papers Project'', is that \"Lieserl\" was adopted by Mari\u0107's close friend, Helene Savi\u0107, and was raised by her and lived under the name \"Zorka Savi\u0107\" until the 1990s. Savi\u0107 did in fact raise a child by the name of Zorka, who was blind from childhood and died in the 1990s. Before his death in 2012, her grandson [[Milan N. Popovi\u0107]], upon extensive research of the relationship between Einstein and Mari\u0107, rejected the possibility that it was \"Lieserl\", and also favoured the hypothesis that the child died in September 1903.<ref>Milan Popovi\u0107: ''In Alberts Shadow.

He had a strong affection for [[mathematics]], and would have liked to study in this or a related area, but as the financial situation of the family precluded further education, he decided to become a merchant and began an apprenticeship in Stuttgart.\n\n=== Marriage to Pauline ===\n\nHermann married 18-year-old [[Einstein family#Pauline Koch (Albert's mother)|Pauline Koch]] in [[Cannstatt]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] on 8 August 1876. After their wedding, the young couple lived in [[Ulm]], where Hermann became joint partner in the feather bed shop of his cousins, Moses and Hermann Levi. In [[Ulm]], their eldest son [[Albert Einstein|Albert]] was born on 14 March 1879. On the initiative of Hermann's brother Jakob, the family moved to Munich in the summer of 1880. There, the two brothers founded the electrical engineering company ''Einstein & Cie'', with Hermann being the merchant and Jakob the technician. The second child of Hermann and Pauline, their daughter Maria (called [[Maja Einstein|Maja]]), was born in [[Munich]] on 18 November 1881.\n\n=== Work ===\nThe Einsteins' electrical firm manufactured [[dynamo]]s and electrical [[Electricity meter|meters]] based on [[direct current]]. They were instrumental in bringing electricity to Munich. In 1885, they won the contract that provided DC lights to illuminate the [[Oktoberfest]] for the first time.\n\nIn 1893 the Einstein brothers lost a bid on a contract for the electrification of Munich to Schukert, Hermann and Jakob's small company lacked the capital to convert their equipment over from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard being used by Schukert.<ref>Barry R. Parker, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books - 2003, page 31</ref> Their fortunes took a downward turn from there. They were forced to sell their Munich factory and, in search of business, the two brothers moved their company to [[Pavia]], Italy in 1894.

In their letters, they called the unborn child \"Lieserl\", when referring to a girl, or \"Hanserl\", if a boy. Both \"Lieserl\" and \"Hanserl\" were diminutives of the common German names [[Liese (given name)|Liese]] (short for Elizabeth) and [[Hans (name)|Hans]].\n\nThe first reference to Mari\u0107's pregnancy was found in a letter Einstein wrote to her from [[Winterthur]], probably on 28 May 1901 (letter 36), asking twice about \"the boy\" and \"our little son\",<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 54</ref> whereas Mari\u0107's first reference was found in her letter of 13 November 1901 (letter 43) from [[Stein am Rhein]], in which she referred to the unborn child as \"Lieserl\".<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 63</ref> Einstein goes along with Mari\u0107's wish for a daughter, and referred to the unborn child as \"Lieserl\" as well, but with a sense of humour as in letter 45 of 12 December 1901 \"... and be happy about our Lieserl, whom I secretly (so Dollie<ref>the english translation of the german \"Doxerl\", one of the names Einstein used for Mari\u0107</ref> doesn't notice) prefer to imagine a Hanserl.\"<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 66</ref>\n\nThe child must have been born shortly before 4 February 1902, when Einstein wrote: \"... now you see that it really is a Lieserl, just as you'd wished. Is she healthy and does she cry properly? [...] I love her so much and don't even know her yet!\"<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 73</ref>\n\nThe last time \"Lieserl\" was mentioned in their extant correspondence was in Einstein's letter of 19 September 1903 (letter 54), in which he showed concern that she had [[scarlet fever]]. His asking \"as what is the child registered? [Adding] we must take precautions that problems don't arise for her later\" may indicate the intention to give the child up for adoption.<ref>''The Love Letters'', p. 78</ref>\n\nAs neither the full name, nor the fate of the child are known, so far several hypotheses about her life and death have been put forward:\n\n*Michele Zackheim, in her book on \"Lieserl\", ''Einstein's Daughter'', states that \"Lieserl\" was [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]], and that she lived with her mother's family and probably died of scarlet fever in September 1903.<ref>[http://www.einstein-website.de/biographies/einsteinlieserl.html ''Lieserl Einstein's biography'']</ref>\n*Another possibility, favoured by Robert Schulmann of the ''Einstein Papers Project'', is that \"Lieserl\" was adopted by Mari\u0107's close friend, Helene Savi\u0107, and was raised by her and lived under the name \"Zorka Savi\u0107\" until the 1990s. Savi\u0107 did in fact raise a child by the name of Zorka, who was blind from childhood and died in the 1990s. Before his death in 2012, her grandson [[Milan N. Popovi\u0107]], upon extensive research of the relationship between Einstein and Mari\u0107, rejected the possibility that it was \"Lieserl\", and also favoured the hypothesis that the child died in September 1903.<ref>Milan Popovi\u0107: ''In Alberts Shadow.

The pain can primarily be on the external surface of the [[genitalia]], or deeper in the pelvis upon deep pressure against the [[cervix]]. It can affect a small portion of the vulva or vagina or be felt all over the surface. Understanding the duration, location, and nature of the pain is important in identifying the causes of the pain.\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nNumerous physical, psychological, and social or relationship causes can contribute to pain during sexual encounters. Commonly, multiple underlying causes contribute to the pain. The pain can be acquired or [[Congenital disorder|congenital]]. Symptoms of dyspareunia may also occur after menopause. Diagnosis is typically by [[physical examination]] and [[medical history]].\n\n<!-- Treatment -->\nUnderlying causes determine treatment.

For women with IC, pain usually occurs the following day, the result of painful, spasming pelvic floor muscles.

Pain is sometimes experienced in the [[Testicle|testicular]] or [[Glans penis|glans]] area of the [[Human penis|penis]] immediately after [[ejaculation]]. Infections of the [[prostate]], bladder, or [[seminal vesicle]]s can lead to intense burning or itching sensations following ejaculation. Men suffering from [[interstitial cystitis]] may experience intense pain at the moment of ejaculation. [[Gonorrhea]]l infections are sometimes associated with burning or sharp penile pains during ejaculation. [[Urethritis]] or [[prostatitis]] can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable. Anatomic deformities of the penis, such as exist in [[Peyronie's disease]], may also result in pain during coitus. One cause of painful intercourse is due to the painful retraction of a too-tight [[foreskin]], occurring either during the first attempt at intercourse or subsequent to tightening or [[scar]]ring following inflammation or local infection.<ref name=Bancroft89/> Another cause of painful intercourse is due to tension in a short and slender frenulum, [[frenulum breve]], as the foreskin retracts on entry to the vagina irrespective of lubrication. In one study frenulum breve was found in 50% of patients who presented with dyspareunia.<ref>Whelan. \"Male dyspareunia due to short frenulum: an indication for adult circumcision\". ''BMJ'' 1977; 24\u201331: 1633-4</ref> During vigorous or deep or tight intercourse or masturbation, small tears may occur in the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenum of the foreskin]] and can bleed and be very painful and induce anxiety, which can become chronic if left unresolved. If stretching fails to ease the condition, and uncomfortable levels of tension remain, a [[frenuloplasty]] procedure may be recommended. Frenuloplasty is an effective procedure, with a high chance of avoiding circumcision, giving good functional results and patient satisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dockray J, Finlayson A, Muir GH |title=Penile frenuloplasty: a simple and effective treatment for frenular pain or scarring |journal=BJU International |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=1546\u201350 |date=May 2012  |pmid=22176714 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10678.x}}</ref> The psychological effects of these conditions, while little understood, are real, and are visible in literature and art.<ref>{{cite web |author=Douglas E |title=JQuad |url=http://jquad.org/edvard-munchs-the-scream/}}</ref>\n\n== Differential diagnosis ==\nDyspareunia is a condition that has many causes and is not a diagnosis of itself. It is combined with [[vaginismus]] into [[genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder]] in the [[DSM-5]]. Criteria for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder include multiple episodes of difficulty with vaginal penetration, pain associated with intercourse attempts, anticipation of pain due to attempted intercourse, and tensing of the pelvis in response to attempted penetration. To meet criteria for this disorder, a patient must experience the symptoms for at least six months and suffer \"significant distress\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|edition=5th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse}}</ref>\n\nThe differential diagnosis for dyspareunia is long because of its complicated and multifactorial nature. Often there are physiologic conditions underlying the pain, as well as psychosocial components that must be assessed to find appropriate treatment. A differential diagnosis of underlying physical causes can be guided by whether the pain is deep or superficial: \n# Superficial dyspareunia or vulvar pain: infection, inflammation, anatomic causes, tissue destruction, psychosocial factors, muscular dysfunction\n# Superficial dyspareunia without visible exam findings: When no other physical cause is found the diagnosis of vulvodynia should be considered. Vaginal atrophy may also not be seen clearly on exam but commonly affects postmenopausal women and is generally associated with [[estrogen]] deficiency.\n# Deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain: [[endometriosis]], [[ovarian cyst]]s, pelvic [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], inflammatory diseases (interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease), infections, congestion, psychosocial factors, \n\n== Treatment ==\nThe treatment for pain with intercourse depends on what is causing the pain. After proper diagnosis one or more treatments for specific causes may be necessary.\n\nFor example:\n* For pain due to yeast or fungal infections, a clinician may prescribe mycogen cream (nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide), which treats both a yeast infection and associated painful inflammation and itching because it contains both an antifungal and a steroid.\n* For pain that is likely due to post-menopausal vaginal dryness, estrogen treatment can be used.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krychman |first= ML |title=Vaginal estrogens for the treatment of dyspareunia |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=666\u201374 |date=March 2011  |pmid=21091878 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02114.x}}</ref> \n* For women with diagnostic criteria for endometriosis, medications or surgery are possible options.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vercellini P, Frattaruolo MP, Somigliana E, etal |title=Surgical versus low-dose progestin treatment for endometriosis-associated severe deep dyspareunia II: effect on sexual functioning, psychological status and health-related quality of life |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=1221\u201330 |date=May 2013  |pmid=23442755 |doi=10.1093/humrep/det041}}</ref>\nIn addition, the following may reduce discomfort with intercourse:\n\n* Clearly explain to the patient what has happened, including identifying sites and causes of pain. Make clear that the pain, in almost all cases, disappears over time, or at least greatly lessens. If there is a partner, explain the causes and treatment and encourage them to be supportive.\n* Encourage the patient to learn about her body, explore her own anatomy and learn how she likes to be caressed and touched.\n* Encourage the couple to add pleasant, sexually exciting experiences to their regular interactions, such as bathing together (in which the primary goal is not cleanliness), or mutual caressing without intercourse. In couples where a woman is preparing to receive vaginal intercourse, such activities tend to increase both natural [[Vaginal lubrication|lubrication]] and vaginal dilation, both of which decrease friction and pain. Prior to intercourse, oral sex may relax and lubricate the vagina (providing both partners are comfortable with it).\n* For those who have pain on deep penetration because of pelvic injury or disease, recommend a change in [[Sex position|coital position]] to one with less penetration. For vaginal penetration in women, the [[Missionary position#Legs up|maximum vaginal penetration]] can be achieved when the receiving woman lies on her back with her pelvis rolled up off the bed, her thighs compressed tightly against her chest, and her calves placed over the shoulders of the penetrating partner. [[Missionary position#Position of legs|Minimal penetration]] occurs when a receiving woman lies on her back with her legs extended flat on the bed and close together while her partner's legs straddle hers. A device has also been described for limiting penetration.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kompanje |first=EJ |title=Painful sexual intercourse caused by a disproportionately long penis: an historical note on a remarkable treatment devised by Guilhelmius Fabricius Hildanus (1560-1634) |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=603\u20135 |date=October 2006  |pmid=17031589 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9057-z}}</ref>\n* Recommend water-soluble [[Personal lubricant|sexual]] or [[surgical lubricant]] during intercourse.

Pain is sometimes experienced in the [[Testicle|testicular]] or [[Glans penis|glans]] area of the [[Human penis|penis]] immediately after [[ejaculation]]. Infections of the [[prostate]], bladder, or [[seminal vesicle]]s can lead to intense burning or itching sensations following ejaculation. Men suffering from [[interstitial cystitis]] may experience intense pain at the moment of ejaculation. [[Gonorrhea]]l infections are sometimes associated with burning or sharp penile pains during ejaculation. [[Urethritis]] or [[prostatitis]] can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable. Anatomic deformities of the penis, such as exist in [[Peyronie's disease]], may also result in pain during coitus. One cause of painful intercourse is due to the painful retraction of a too-tight [[foreskin]], occurring either during the first attempt at intercourse or subsequent to tightening or [[scar]]ring following inflammation or local infection.<ref name=Bancroft89/> Another cause of painful intercourse is due to tension in a short and slender frenulum, [[frenulum breve]], as the foreskin retracts on entry to the vagina irrespective of lubrication. In one study frenulum breve was found in 50% of patients who presented with dyspareunia.<ref>Whelan. \"Male dyspareunia due to short frenulum: an indication for adult circumcision\". ''BMJ'' 1977; 24\u201331: 1633-4</ref> During vigorous or deep or tight intercourse or masturbation, small tears may occur in the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenum of the foreskin]] and can bleed and be very painful and induce anxiety, which can become chronic if left unresolved. If stretching fails to ease the condition, and uncomfortable levels of tension remain, a [[frenuloplasty]] procedure may be recommended. Frenuloplasty is an effective procedure, with a high chance of avoiding circumcision, giving good functional results and patient satisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dockray J, Finlayson A, Muir GH |title=Penile frenuloplasty: a simple and effective treatment for frenular pain or scarring |journal=BJU International |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=1546\u201350 |date=May 2012  |pmid=22176714 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10678.x}}</ref> The psychological effects of these conditions, while little understood, are real, and are visible in literature and art.<ref>{{cite web |author=Douglas E |title=JQuad |url=http://jquad.org/edvard-munchs-the-scream/}}</ref>\n\n== Differential diagnosis ==\nDyspareunia is a condition that has many causes and is not a diagnosis of itself. It is combined with [[vaginismus]] into [[genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder]] in the [[DSM-5]]. Criteria for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder include multiple episodes of difficulty with vaginal penetration, pain associated with intercourse attempts, anticipation of pain due to attempted intercourse, and tensing of the pelvis in response to attempted penetration. To meet criteria for this disorder, a patient must experience the symptoms for at least six months and suffer \"significant distress\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|edition=5th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse}}</ref>\n\nThe differential diagnosis for dyspareunia is long because of its complicated and multifactorial nature. Often there are physiologic conditions underlying the pain, as well as psychosocial components that must be assessed to find appropriate treatment. A differential diagnosis of underlying physical causes can be guided by whether the pain is deep or superficial: \n# Superficial dyspareunia or vulvar pain: infection, inflammation, anatomic causes, tissue destruction, psychosocial factors, muscular dysfunction\n# Superficial dyspareunia without visible exam findings: When no other physical cause is found the diagnosis of vulvodynia should be considered. Vaginal atrophy may also not be seen clearly on exam but commonly affects postmenopausal women and is generally associated with [[estrogen]] deficiency.\n# Deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain: [[endometriosis]], [[ovarian cyst]]s, pelvic [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], inflammatory diseases (interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease), infections, congestion, psychosocial factors, \n\n== Treatment ==\nThe treatment for pain with intercourse depends on what is causing the pain. After proper diagnosis one or more treatments for specific causes may be necessary.\n\nFor example:\n* For pain due to yeast or fungal infections, a clinician may prescribe mycogen cream (nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide), which treats both a yeast infection and associated painful inflammation and itching because it contains both an antifungal and a steroid.\n* For pain that is likely due to post-menopausal vaginal dryness, estrogen treatment can be used.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krychman |first= ML |title=Vaginal estrogens for the treatment of dyspareunia |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=666\u201374 |date=March 2011  |pmid=21091878 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02114.x}}</ref> \n* For women with diagnostic criteria for endometriosis, medications or surgery are possible options.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vercellini P, Frattaruolo MP, Somigliana E, etal |title=Surgical versus low-dose progestin treatment for endometriosis-associated severe deep dyspareunia II: effect on sexual functioning, psychological status and health-related quality of life |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=1221\u201330 |date=May 2013  |pmid=23442755 |doi=10.1093/humrep/det041}}</ref>\nIn addition, the following may reduce discomfort with intercourse:\n\n* Clearly explain to the patient what has happened, including identifying sites and causes of pain. Make clear that the pain, in almost all cases, disappears over time, or at least greatly lessens. If there is a partner, explain the causes and treatment and encourage them to be supportive.\n* Encourage the patient to learn about her body, explore her own anatomy and learn how she likes to be caressed and touched.\n* Encourage the couple to add pleasant, sexually exciting experiences to their regular interactions, such as bathing together (in which the primary goal is not cleanliness), or mutual caressing without intercourse. In couples where a woman is preparing to receive vaginal intercourse, such activities tend to increase both natural [[Vaginal lubrication|lubrication]] and vaginal dilation, both of which decrease friction and pain. Prior to intercourse, oral sex may relax and lubricate the vagina (providing both partners are comfortable with it).\n* For those who have pain on deep penetration because of pelvic injury or disease, recommend a change in [[Sex position|coital position]] to one with less penetration. For vaginal penetration in women, the [[Missionary position#Legs up|maximum vaginal penetration]] can be achieved when the receiving woman lies on her back with her pelvis rolled up off the bed, her thighs compressed tightly against her chest, and her calves placed over the shoulders of the penetrating partner. [[Missionary position#Position of legs|Minimal penetration]] occurs when a receiving woman lies on her back with her legs extended flat on the bed and close together while her partner's legs straddle hers. A device has also been described for limiting penetration.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kompanje |first=EJ |title=Painful sexual intercourse caused by a disproportionately long penis: an historical note on a remarkable treatment devised by Guilhelmius Fabricius Hildanus (1560-1634) |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=603\u20135 |date=October 2006  |pmid=17031589 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9057-z}}</ref>\n* Recommend water-soluble [[Personal lubricant|sexual]] or [[surgical lubricant]] during intercourse. Discourage [[petroleum jelly]]. Lubricant should be liberally applied (two tablespoons full) to both the penis and the orifice.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac epoxy resin===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic epoxy resins ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated epoxy resins ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Epoxy resin diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine epoxy resin===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing epoxy resins==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints.

[[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount.

These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n=== Wind Turbine Technology composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\n[[File:Citizen se-733 int 1ac.jpg|thumb|The interior of a pocket calculator. The dark lump of epoxy in the center covers the processor chip]]\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s, and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\n\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".<ref name=\"onepetro.org\"/>\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as [[Durcupan]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A new embedding technique for electron microscopy, combining a water-soluble epoxy resin (Durcupan) with water-insoluble Araldite\n |author=St\u00e4ubli, W.\n |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=197\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/16/1/197.full.pdf\n |doi=10.1083/jcb.16.1.197|pmc=2106182\n |pmid=13978678\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A Modification of the Water-miscible Epoxy Resin \"Durcupan\" Embedding Method for Ultrathin Sectioning\n |author=Kushida, H.\n |journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy\n |volume=12\n |issue=1\n |pages=72\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Japan Society Microscopy\n |url=http://jmicro.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/72.extract }}\n</ref>\nare commonly used for [[electron microscope#Sample preparation|embedding]]\n[[electron microscope]] samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a [[microtome]] and then imaged.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n |author=Luft, J.H.\n |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n |volume=9\n |issue=2\n |pages=409\n |year=1961\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/9/2/409.full.pdf }}\n</ref>\n\n===Art===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with [[pigment]], may be used as a painting [[Media (arts)#Painting|medium]], by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCreight|first1=Tim|last2=Bsullak|first2=Nicole|title=Color on Metal: 50 Artists Share Insights and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nBQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Guild Pub.|isbn=978-1-893164-06-2}}</ref> It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.\n\n== Industry ==\nThe global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some \u20ac1,055 million in sales. Germany <ref name=socio2013 />  is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic]]/[[mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\n\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr079.pdf] An assessment of skin sensitisation by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry, 2003</ref> Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of [[occupational asthma]] among users of plastics.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/occupational-asthma/DS00591/DSECTION=risk-factors MayoClinic --> Occupational asthma] May 23, 2009</ref> [[Bisphenol A]], which is used to manufacture a common class of epoxy resins, is a known [[endocrine disruptor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the thermoset plastic materials|the chemical group|epoxide}}\n[[File:FiveMinEpoxy.jpg|thumb|A syringe of \"5-minute\" epoxy glue, containing separate compartments for the epoxy resin and the hardener.]]\n[[File:Epoxide_generic.png|thumb|Structure of the epoxide group, a reactive functional group present in all epoxy resins.]]\n'''Epoxy''' refers to any of the basic components or [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] end products of '''epoxy resins''', as well as a colloquial name for the [[epoxide]] functional group.<ref name=\"May2018\">{{cite book |author=Clayton May |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology (Second Edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XlaDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA64&lpg=RA2-PA64&focus=viewport&vq=%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed%22&dq=may+Epoxy+Resins:+Chemistry+and+Technology+Second+Edition,+%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed+for+electrical+and+electronic+applications%22#v=onepage&q=%22Epoxies%20are%20the%20resins%20most%20commonly%20employed%22&f=false |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-351-44995-3 |page=65 |quote=Epoxies are the resins most commonly employed for electrical and electronic applications.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac epoxy resin===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic epoxy resins ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated epoxy resins ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Epoxy resin diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine epoxy resin===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing epoxy resins==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P. Schlack, I. G.

Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n=== Wind Turbine Technology composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\n[[File:Citizen se-733 int 1ac.jpg|thumb|The interior of a pocket calculator. The dark lump of epoxy in the center covers the processor chip]]\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s, and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\n\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".<ref name=\"onepetro.org\"/>\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as [[Durcupan]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A new embedding technique for electron microscopy, combining a water-soluble epoxy resin (Durcupan) with water-insoluble Araldite\n |author=St\u00e4ubli, W.\n |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=197\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/16/1/197.full.pdf\n |doi=10.1083/jcb.16.1.197|pmc=2106182\n |pmid=13978678\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A Modification of the Water-miscible Epoxy Resin \"Durcupan\" Embedding Method for Ultrathin Sectioning\n |author=Kushida, H.\n |journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy\n |volume=12\n |issue=1\n |pages=72\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Japan Society Microscopy\n |url=http://jmicro.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/72.extract }}\n</ref>\nare commonly used for [[electron microscope#Sample preparation|embedding]]\n[[electron microscope]] samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a [[microtome]] and then imaged.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n |author=Luft, J.H.\n |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n |volume=9\n |issue=2\n |pages=409\n |year=1961\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/9/2/409.full.pdf }}\n</ref>\n\n===Art===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with [[pigment]], may be used as a painting [[Media (arts)#Painting|medium]], by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCreight|first1=Tim|last2=Bsullak|first2=Nicole|title=Color on Metal: 50 Artists Share Insights and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nBQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Guild Pub.|isbn=978-1-893164-06-2}}</ref> It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.\n\n== Industry ==\nThe global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some \u20ac1,055 million in sales. Germany <ref name=socio2013 />  is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic]]/[[mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\n\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr079.pdf] An assessment of skin sensitisation by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry, 2003</ref> Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of [[occupational asthma]] among users of plastics.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/occupational-asthma/DS00591/DSECTION=risk-factors MayoClinic --> Occupational asthma] May 23, 2009</ref> [[Bisphenol A]], which is used to manufacture a common class of epoxy resins, is a known [[endocrine disruptor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "name_user": "Acwilson9", "label": "safe", "comment": "{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"}
