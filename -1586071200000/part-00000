He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline. ''Collected Poems, John Pudney'']</ref> Written during an air raid, it was published first in the News Chronicle, and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\nPudney published several collections of poetry during the war, including ''Dispersal Point'' (1942) and ''South of Forty'' (1943, describing the author's experiences in North Africa). These collections sold over a quarter of a million copies between them.<ref name=white>White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in ''The Guardian'', 6 April, 1972, p 10</ref> One contemporary reviewer, noting that these poems were \"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\", showed \"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\".<ref>''The Listener'', 23 September 1943, p 357</ref>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref> (The sitting Conservative MP [[Charles Ponsonby]] was re-elected with 46 per cent of the vote).\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the [[News Review]] from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to [[Evans Brothers]], Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long-standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'', ''Spring Adventure'' etc), and the six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children. These were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they haven't remained in print. Most significantly while at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner of war [[Paul Brickhill]] to come to England and write [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']], which Evans published 1950. He had previously suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of [[617 Squadron]]. After the success of The Great Escape, this was also published by Evans as [[The Dam Busters (book)|''The Dam Busters'']] (1951), selling over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins, Stephen. ''The Hero Maker: A Biography of Paul Brickhill'' (2016)</ref>\n\nOf his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen. ''Aviation in the Cinema''. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8-1081-746-2}}.</ref> In 1953 Pudney wrote the script for the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971)<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref>. \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978. His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]].

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

''London Writing of the 1930s'' (2018) p 88]</ref>\n\n==War Poetry==\nIt was the advent of the Second World War that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit - a non-combatant role. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline.

These collections sold over a quarter of a million copies between them.<ref name=white>White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in ''The Guardian'', 6 April, 1972, p 10</ref> One contemporary reviewer, noting that these poems were \"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\", showed \"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\".<ref>''The Listener'', 23 September 1943, p 357</ref>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref> (The sitting Conservative MP [[Charles Ponsonby]] was re-elected with 46 per cent of the vote).\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the [[News Review]] from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to [[Evans Brothers]], Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long-standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'', ''Spring Adventure'' etc), and the six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children. These were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they haven't remained in print. Most significantly while at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner of war [[Paul Brickhill]] to come to England and write [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']] which Evans published 1950. He had previously suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of [[617 Squadron]]. After the success of The Great Escape, this was also published by Evans as [[The Dam Busters (book)|''The Dam Busters'']] (1951), selling over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins, Stephen. ''The Hero Maker: A Biography of Paul Brickhill'' (2016)</ref>\n\nOf his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen. ''Aviation in the Cinema''. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8-1081-746-2}}.</ref> In 1953 Pudney wrote the script for the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971)<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref>. \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978. His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. She married the film critic [[V. F. Perkins|Victor Perkins]] in the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries Tessa Perkins obituary in ''The Guardian'', 4 November 2004]</ref> Their son, [[Toby Perkins]], is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with [[Henry Treece|Henry Treece]])\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

Potts, ''Baptist colleges in the development of American society, 1812\u20131861'' (1988).</ref> Catholics opened several women's colleges in the early 20th century. Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Many combine some or all of the above, as comprehensive universities.\n\n===Terminology===\nThe term \"college\" refers to one of three types of education institutions: stand-alone higher level education institutions that are not components of a university.\n# [[community colleges in the United States|community colleges]]\n# [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]\n# a college within a university, mostly the undergraduate institution of a university. \n[[File:MIT Dome night1 Edit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|left|The Great Dome of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), a university adopting the [[polytechnic university model]].]]\n\nAlmost all colleges and universities are [[coeducation]]al. A dramatic transition occurred in the 1970s, when most [[Men's colleges in the United States|men's colleges]] started to accept women. Over 80% of the women's colleges of the 1960s have closed or merged, leaving fewer than 50. Over 100 [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) operate, both private and public.\n\nSome [[U.S. states]] offer higher education at two year \"colleges\" formerly called \"[[community college]]s\". The change requires cooperation between community colleges and local universities.\n\n[[File:College degrees graph.png|upright|thumb|right|Share of all bachelor's degrees awarded by field]]\n\nFour-year colleges often provide the [[bachelor's degree]], most commonly the [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.).

Completing each course to the schools satisfaction gains the student a number of credits. To enter tertiary education the student will be doing a number of [[Advanced placement]] courses that will gain the highest number of credits. A student graduates from High School when the minimum number of credits has been achieved, and will be accepted by a college when their required number is achieved. The college system is similar: each course passed earns a set number of credits, and the student graduates with an undergraduate degree when the set number have been earned. The credits travel with the student should they change institution. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}} <!-- This is a paragraph that is needed for non-US to follow the rest of the article- but it must be corrected by someone in the US-->\n\n===Universities===\n[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Anselm College]], a [[New England]] liberal arts college]]\nUniversities are educational institutions with undergraduate and graduate programs.

The first tier includes sports sanctioned by one of the collegiate sport governing bodies. Some of these collegiate sports governing organizations like the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) are umbrella [[non-profit organization]]s that govern multiple sports. Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer [[athletic scholarship]]s to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes [[intramural]] and recreational sports clubs, which are available to more of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosandich|first=Thomas|title=Collegiate Sports Programs: A Comparative Analysis|page=476|publisher=Education|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe largest collegiate sport governing body in the first tier is the NCAA, which regulates athletes of 1,268 institutions across the US and Canada. The NCAA uses a three-division system of [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport, while Division III schools cannot offer any athletic scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D313.pdf |title=Bylaw 15.01.3 Institutional Financial Aid |work=2012\u201313 NCAA Division III Manual |publisher=NCAA |page=107 |access-date=December 19, 2012}}</ref> Division I schools, which generally are larger than either Division II or III institutions, must further meet additional requirements: among them, they must field teams in at least seven sports for men and seven for women or six for men and eight for women, with at least two team sports for each gender.<ref name=\"NCAA Division Differences\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/who+we+are/differences+among+the+divisions/division+i/about+division+i |title=The Official Web Site of the NCAA |publisher=NCAA.org |access-date=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117032949/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/who+we+are/differences+among+the+divisions/division+i/about+division+i |archivedate=January 17, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> Each division is then further divided into several [[athletic conference|conferences]] for regional league play.

Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Many combine some or all of the above, as comprehensive universities.\n\n===Terminology===\nThe term \"college\" refers to one of three types of education institutions: stand-alone higher level education institutions that are not components of a university.\n# [[community colleges in the United States|community colleges]]\n# [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]\n# a college within a university, mostly the undergraduate institution of a university. \n[[File:MIT Dome night1 Edit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|left|The Great Dome of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), a university adopting the [[polytechnic university model]].]]\n\nAlmost all colleges and universities are [[coeducation]]al. A dramatic transition occurred in the 1970s, when most [[Men's colleges in the United States|men's colleges]] started to accept women. Over 80% of the women's colleges of the 1960s have closed or merged, leaving fewer than 50. Over 100 [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) operate, both private and public.\n\nSome [[U.S. states]] offer higher education at two year \"colleges\" formerly called \"[[community college]]s\". The change requires cooperation between community colleges and local universities.\n\n[[File:College degrees graph.png|upright|thumb|right|Share of all bachelor's degrees awarded by field]]\n\nFour-year colleges often provide the [[bachelor's degree]], most commonly the [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.).

Completing each course to the schools satisfaction gains the student a number of credits. To enter tertiary education the student will be doing a number of [[Advanced placement]] courses that will gain the highest number of credits. A student graduates from High School when the minimum number of credits has been achieved, and will be accepted by a college when their required number is achieved. The college system is similar: each course passed earns a set number of credits, and the student graduates with an undergraduate degree when the set number have been earned. The credits travel with the student should they change institution. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}} <!-- This is a paragraph that is needed for non-US to follow the rest of the article- but it must be corrected by someone in the US-->\n\n===Universities===\n[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Anselm College]], a [[New England]] liberal arts college]]\nUniversities are educational institutions with undergraduate and graduate programs.

The first tier includes sports sanctioned by one of the collegiate sport governing bodies. Some of these collegiate sports governing organizations like the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) are umbrella [[non-profit organization]]s that govern multiple sports. Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer [[athletic scholarship]]s to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes [[intramural]] and recreational sports clubs, which are available to more of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosandich|first=Thomas|title=Collegiate Sports Programs: A Comparative Analysis|page=476|publisher=Education|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe largest collegiate sport governing body in the first tier is the NCAA, which regulates athletes of 1,268 institutions across the US and Canada. The NCAA uses a three-division system of [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport, while Division III schools cannot offer any athletic scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D313.pdf |title=Bylaw 15.01.3 Institutional Financial Aid |work=2012\u201313 NCAA Division III Manual |publisher=NCAA |page=107 |access-date=December 19, 2012}}</ref> Division I schools, which generally are larger than either Division II or III institutions, must further meet additional requirements: among them, they must field teams in at least seven sports for men and seven for women or six for men and eight for women, with at least two team sports for each gender.<ref name=\"NCAA Division Differences\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/who+we+are/differences+among+the+divisions/division+i/about+division+i |title=The Official Web Site of the NCAA |publisher=NCAA.org |access-date=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117032949/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/who+we+are/differences+among+the+divisions/division+i/about+division+i |archivedate=January 17, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> Each division is then further divided into several [[athletic conference|conferences]] for regional league play.

It is part of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]]. It offers [[High school diploma|high school]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]], [[Master's degree|master]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] degrees. It has had an expansion in the country, creating its own university national system. Its main campus is located in [[Mexico City]], and has a presence in [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Gomez Palacio]], [[Monterrey]], [[Ciudad Victoria]], [[Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato|Leon]], [[Morelia]], [[Pachuca]], [[Ciudad Nezahualc\u00f3yotl]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Puebla]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Cancun]] and [[Saltillo]].\n\nIt is part of the educational community of the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]], founded by Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]], patron saint of education. The congregation has about seventy-seven thousand lay partners and one million students around the world, with establishments of higher learning in [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Guatemala]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United States]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Israel]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1905, the brothers of La Salle Jerbert Alphonse Gibert, Adrien Marie Astruc, Amed\u00e9e Francois Vincent and Antoinde Claude Carrel traveled to Mexico from [[Le Havre]], France, along with Br. Pedro Celestino Schniedier who traveled from Colombia. They founded the delegation of LaSalle brethren in Mexico. The brothers created schools in Puebla, Toluca, Torreon, Monterrey, and various other locations in the country. Their first high school in Mexico City opened in 1931, the Colegio Franc\u00e9s De la Salle. In 1932 the school won formal recognition and authorization by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. In 1938 the Colegio Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n was also established in the Colonia San Rafael.\n\nThe history of Universidad La Salle began with the relocation of Colegio Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n to the center of the traditional Colonia Condesa in Mexico City in 1962. On February 15 it opened its doors with only the high school building completed and a partially built tower, gym and auditorium. By May of the same year, it had rapidly grown enough to announce its transformation from a just a school to a full university category. Since then it has undergone continuous expansion. The main campus has a population of approximately 10,000 students, and has expanded its campus throughout Mexico City with buildings in many areas of the city.\n\nThere are branches of Universidad La Salle in 15 Mexican states. The La Salle educational institution itself is represented in over 82 different countries, and 5 continents making it the largest educational community in the world.\n\nULSA is among the top 7 private universities in Mexico and ranked in the top three in areas such as Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Medicine.\n\nThe Universidad La Salle medical school (Facultad Mexicana de Medicina) is one of the most prestigious universities in Mexico for medical training. It was Mexico's first private medical school and was founded in 1970. It is accredited by the Consejo Mexicano para la Acreditaci\u00f3n de la Educaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica (COMAEM), and is listed in the International Medical Education Directory. Albeit a young school, many of the country's department heads are graduates from La Salle.\n[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|200px]]\n\n==University presidents==\n*2011\u2013Present Dr. Enrique Gonzalez Alvarez\n*2009\u20132011 M.A. Mart\u00edn Rocha Pedrajo\n*2006\u20132009 [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] Ambrosio Luna Salas\n*2000\u20132006 [[Master (college)|Mtro.]] Ra\u00fal Valadez Garc\u00eda\n*1991\u20132000 Dr. Lucio Tazzer de Schrijver\n*1988\u20131991 Dr. Jos\u00e9 Cervantes Hern\u00e1ndez\n*1983\u20131988 M.A. C\u00e9sar Rangel Barrera\n*1974\u20131983 Dr. Francisco L.

It is part of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]]. It offers [[High school diploma|high school]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]], [[Master's degree|master]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] degrees. It has had an expansion in the country, creating its own university national system. Its main campus is located in [[Mexico City]], and has a presence in [[Ciudad Obregon]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Gomez Palacio]], [[Monterrey]], [[Ciudad Victoria]], [[Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato|Leon]], [[Morelia]], [[Pachuca]], [[Ciudad Nezahualc\u00f3yotl]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Puebla]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Cancun]] and [[Saltillo]].\n\nIt is part of the educational community of the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]], founded by Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]], patron saint of education. The congregation has about seventy-seven thousand lay partners and one million students around the world, with establishments of higher learning in [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Guatemala]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United States]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Israel]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1905, the brothers of La Salle Jerbert Alphonse Gibert, Adrien Marie Astruc, Amed\u00e9e Francois Vincent and Antoinde Claude Carrel traveled to Mexico from [[Le Havre]], France, along with Br. Pedro Celestino Schniedier who traveled from Colombia. They founded the delegation of LaSalle brethren in Mexico. The brothers created schools in Puebla, Toluca, Torreon, Monterrey, and various other locations in the country. Their first high school in Mexico City opened in 1931, the Colegio Franc\u00e9s De la Salle. In 1932 the school won formal recognition and authorization by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. In 1938 the Colegio Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n was also established in the Colonia San Rafael.\n\nThe history of Universidad La Salle began with the relocation of Colegio Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n to the center of the traditional Colonia Condesa in Mexico City in 1962. On February 15 it opened its doors with only the high school building completed and a partially built tower, gym and auditorium. By May of the same year, it had rapidly grown enough to announce its transformation from a just a school to a full university category. Since then it has undergone continuous expansion. The main campus has a population of approximately 10,000 students, and has expanded its campus throughout Mexico City with buildings in many areas of the city.\n\nThere are branches of Universidad La Salle in 15 Mexican states. The La Salle educational institution itself is represented in over 82 different countries, and 5 continents making it the largest educational community in the world.\n\nULSA is among the top 7 private universities in Mexico and ranked in the top three in areas such as Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Medicine.\n\nThe Universidad La Salle medical school (Facultad Mexicana de Medicina) is one of the most prestigious universities in Mexico for medical training. It was Mexico's first private medical school and was founded in 1970. It is accredited by the Consejo Mexicano para la Acreditaci\u00f3n de la Educaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica (COMAEM), and is listed in the International Medical Education Directory. Albeit a young school, many of the country's department heads are graduates from La Salle.\n[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|200px]]\n\n==University presidents==\n*2011\u2013Present Dr. Enrique Gonzalez Alvarez\n*2009\u20132011 M.A. Mart\u00edn Rocha Pedrajo\n*2006\u20132009 [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] Ambrosio Luna Salas\n*2000\u20132006 [[Master (college)|Mtro.]] Ra\u00fal Valadez Garc\u00eda\n*1991\u20132000 Dr. Lucio Tazzer de Schrijver\n*1988\u20131991 Dr. Jos\u00e9 Cervantes Hern\u00e1ndez\n*1983\u20131988 M.A. C\u00e9sar Rangel Barrera\n*1974\u20131983 Dr. Francisco L.
