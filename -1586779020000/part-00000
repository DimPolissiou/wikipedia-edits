The method uses [[EDTA]] (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) to form a complex with [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ions. The Patton-Reeder Indicator (hereafter PR) is used as the indicator. PR alone is a dye with blue colour, but when it forms a complex with the suspended calcium ions, it undergoes a colour change from blue to pink/red. However, it must be noted that the metal ion-PR complex has less stability than the metal ion-EDTA complex.

The method uses [[EDTA]] (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) to form a complex with [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ions. The Patton-Reeder Indicator (hereafter PR) is used as the indicator. PR alone is a dye with blue colour, but when it forms a complex with the suspended calcium ions, it undergoes a colour change from blue to pink/red. However, it must be noted that the metal ion-PR complex has less stability than the metal ion-EDTA complex. Hence, when a Ca-PR complex comes into contact with EDTA, the Ca2+ ions react with EDTA to form a stronger, more stable complex with it (Ca-EDTA).<ref name=\"Determination of Calcium Ion Concentration\">{{cite web |title=Determination of Calcium Ion Concentration |url=https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/media/documents/science-outreach/calcium.pdf |website=College of Science |publisher=University of Canterbury, New Zealand |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor the complexometric titration, the indicator is first added to the [[titrant]] containing the calcium ions to form the calcium ion-indicator complex (Ca-PR) with a pink/red colour.

The Young Nationals have been a strong lobby group inside the National Party, and often at the forefront of policy development being representative as a ''Core Group'' or a ''Policy Action Group'' of the party at varying times. For a short period during the party's earlier years there was a younger section of the National party for pre-teenage members but has since disappeared due to the changing environment of New Zealand politics and society.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nPrior to the group being named the Young Nationals, the New Zealand [[New Zealand National Party|National Party's]] Youth section was known as the Junior Nationals.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In the lead up to the 1949 election, the  Wellington branch had 3,500 members and the Auckland branch consisted of 2,500 members.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=256}} The group hosted a number of community events such as dances, parties, debating/discussion, and Lectures/addresses. In 1967 the group voted to change the name to the Young Nationals as Junior Nationals was seen to have potentially negative connotations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} This renamed group attracted members for political reasons rather than social activities like its predecessor.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In 1968 the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] agreed to for two Young Nationals to sit on the party's Dominion Council.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} 1971 brought upon Young Nationals creating political discussion groups called 'Pol Link's' which enabled the group to research and discuss political issues allowing the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] to understand the contemporary issues of young generations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=263}} In 2015 the Young Nationals claimed to have over 20,000 [[Facebook likes|likes]] on their Facebook page and over 6,000 official members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=National at 80 Years: The Story of the New Zealand National Party|last=James|first=Colin|publisher=Bateman|year=2017|isbn=|location=Auckland|page=283}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nIn 2009, under major changes led by the organisation's governing executive, the Young Nationals were re-organised to serve as a more effective tool for policy activism and campaign activity.\n\n===Regional Teams===\n\nAs of 2011, The Young Nationals are divided into five regions nationwide:\n\n* Northern; \n* Central North Island; \n* Lower North Island; \n* Canterbury-Westland; and\n* Southern.\n\nEach of these regions are headed by their own Chair and executive group and supervised by a National Executive, elected annually during the National Party Conference.\n\nSome regions of the Young Nationals also may have branches.

'''Young Nats''', is the youth wing of the [[New Zealand National Party]], a centre-right political party in New Zealand, and a member of the [[International Young Democrat Union]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe National Party has had a youth section since its inception in 1936. The Young Nationals have been a strong lobby group inside the National Party, and often at the forefront of policy development being representative as a ''Core Group'' or a ''Policy Action Group'' of the party at varying times. For a short period during the party's earlier years there was a younger section of the National party for pre-teenage members but has since disappeared due to the changing environment of New Zealand politics and society.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nPrior to the group being named the Young Nationals, the New Zealand [[New Zealand National Party|National Party's]] Youth section was known as the Junior Nationals.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In the lead up to the 1949 election, the  Wellington branch had 3,500 members and the Auckland branch consisted of 2,500 members.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=256}} The group hosted a number of community events such as dances, parties, debating/discussion, and Lectures/addresses. In 1967 the group voted to change the name to the Young Nationals as Junior Nationals was seen to have potentially negative connotations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} This renamed group attracted members for political reasons rather than social activities like its predecessor.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In 1968 the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] agreed to for two Young Nationals to sit on the party's Dominion Council.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} 1971 brought upon Young Nationals creating political discussion groups called 'Pol Link's' which enabled the group to research and discuss political issues allowing the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] to understand the contemporary issues of young generations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=263}} In 2015 the Young Nationals claimed to have over 20,000 [[Facebook likes|likes]] on their Facebook page and over 6,000 official members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=National at 80 Years: The Story of the New Zealand National Party|last=James|first=Colin|publisher=Bateman|year=2017|isbn=|location=Auckland|page=283}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nIn 2009, under major changes led by the organisation's governing executive, the Young Nationals were re-organised to serve as a more effective tool for policy activism and campaign activity.\n\n===Regional Teams===\n\nAs of 2011, The Young Nationals are divided into five regions nationwide:\n\n* Northern; \n* Central North Island; \n* Lower North Island; \n* Canterbury-Westland; and\n* Southern.\n\nEach of these regions are headed by their own Chair and executive group and supervised by a National Executive, elected annually during the National Party Conference.\n\nSome regions of the Young Nationals also may have branches. These include the ''Alfred Street Young Nationals'',<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/alfredstreetnational |title= Alfred Street Young Nationals}}</ref> which are based in Auckland and considered a counter group to the [[Princes Street Labour]] movement and ''VicNats''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/VicNats/127981860617677 |title=VicNats}}</ref> which is based around [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]]. In 2011, the Young Nationals celebrated 75 years as New Zealand's oldest and largest political youth movement.<ref>[http://www.youngnats.org.nz/2011/04/16/young-nats-celebrate-milestone-raise-10000/ Young Nats celebrate milestone & raise $10,000]</ref>\n\n===National Team===\n\nThe National Executive, are made up of elected members across New Zealand who, set the agenda and leadership for the Young Nationals during the year. There are currently 12 members. They are made of a:\n\n* President;\n* Vice-President;\n* Secretary;\n* Treasurer;\n* Policy Chair;\n* Creative Director; and\n* The Chairs of each of the Regional Executives<ref>https://youngnats.national.org.nz/your_team</ref>\n\n==Policies==\nOften the more liberal views of the Young Nationals have been at odds with those of the wider party. The shift in party opinion in areas such as the nuclear ships debate, economic reform, liquor law reform, and anti-discrimination laws has often been influenced by the Young Nationals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youngnats.national.org.nz/our_story|title=Our Story|website=Young Nats|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===Drug Policy===\n\n==== Alcohol ====\nThe Young Nationals, in conjunction with other New Zealand political party youth wings,<ref>[http://www.keepit18.org.nz Keep it 18]</ref> support the current purchase age for alcohol of 18 years. The Young Nationals lobbied the government in 2012 to keep the drinking age at 18 when the [[Sale and Supply of Liquor Act Amendment Bill]] was put by parliament. The Bill successfully passed. This position was reaffirmed in 2018. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://youngnats.national.org.nz/keep_it_18_pr|title=NZ Young Nats stand by Keep it 18|date=2018-12-06|website=Young Nats|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==== Pill Testing ====\nIn late 2019, the Young Nationals moved to support pill testing at festivals and concerts.

Kemigawa became a town in 1891, and Chiba became a city in 1921. Chiba annexed Tsuga Village and Kemigawa Town in 1937, and Kotegawa in 1954.<ref name=\"n\"/> Inage historically faced [[Tokyo Bay]], and given its proximity to Tokyo, was a popular tourist destination for swimming and [[clamming]].

Results showed that they shared a common female ancestor.<ref name=aggarwal2007/>\nAs this study was based on captive-bred zoo specimens that had descended from only two females, these samples were not considered to be representative.

Glaciation during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] may have caused habitat loss, genetic isolation and ancient inbreeding.

Some wolves in China and Mongolia also fall within the Himalayan wolf clade, indicating a common maternal ancestor and a wide distribution.<ref name=ersmark2016/> There was evidence of [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] with the grey wolf at Sachyat-Ertash in the [[Issyk-Kul]] region of [[Kyrgyzstan]], and of [[introgression]] from either the grey wolf or the dog into the Himalayan wolf in Nepal.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n{{Cladogram|align=left |title=[[Phylogenetic tree]] of the extant wolf-like canids with timing in millions of years{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=mtdna_seq_desc|For a full set of supporting references refer to the note (a) in the phylotree at [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids]]}}|caption=<big>Blue shading represents the species ''Canis lupus''\n</big>\n|cladogram={{clade | style = font-size:85%;line-height:80%;width:550px;\n |label1=[[Caninae]] 3.5&nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]]\n |1={{clade\n  |label1=3.0\n  |1={{clade\n   |label1=2.5\n   |1={{clade\n    |label1=2.0\n    |1={{clade\n     |label1=0.96\n     |1={{clade\n       |label1=0.60\n       |1={{clade\n        |label1=0.38 \n        |1={{clade\n        |style1=background-color:#ccccff;\n         |label1=0.25\n         |1={{clade\n          |label1=0.12\n          |1={{clade\n           |label1=0.08\n           |1={{clade\n            |label1=0.031 \n            |1={{clade\n             |1=[[Dog|Domestic dog]] [[File:Tibetan mastiff (transparent background).png|50 px]]\n             |2=Holarctic [[Wolf|grey wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n             }}\n            |2=[[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]]\u2020 [[File:The_American_Museum_journal_(c1900-(1918))_(Canis_dirus)_transparent_background.png|60 px]]\n            }}\n            |2=[[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian plains wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n           }}\n           |2='''Himalayan wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n          }}\n         |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n         }}\n        |2={{clade\n         |1=[[African golden wolf]] northwestern Africa[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n         |2=African golden wolf eastern Africa[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n        }}\n        |label2=0.11\n       }}\n       |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).jpg|50 px]]\n       }}\n      |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).jpg|50 px]]\n      }}\n     |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).jpg|50 px]]\n     }}\n     |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).jpg|50 px]]\n   }}\n  |2={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n    |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).jpg|50 px]]\n    |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).jpg|50 px]]\n    }}\n    |label1=2.6\n   }}\n  }}\n }}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n[[DNA sequences]] can be mapped to reveal a [[phylogenetic tree]] that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term [[Basal (phylogenetics)|\u201cbasal\u201d]] is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor.<ref name=reece2015/>\n\n===Admixture with the Tibetan mastiff===\nThe [[Tibetan Mastiff]] was able to adapt to the extreme highland conditions of the Tibetan Plateau very quickly compared to other mammals such as the yak, Tibetan antelope, snow leopard, and the wild boar. The Tibetan Mastiff's ability to avoid [[Hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxia]] in high altitudes, due to its higher [[hemoglobin]] levels compared to low-altitude dogs, was due to prehistoric interbreeding with the wolves of Tibet.<ref name=Miao2016/><ref name=Signore2019/>\n\n===Relationship with the African golden wolf===\n[[File:Himalayan wolves.jpg|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in [[Darjeeling]]]]\nIn 2011, it was proposed that the [[Indian wolf]], Himalayan wolf, and [[African golden wolf]] represent ancient wolf lineages, with the African golden wolf having colonised Africa prior to the northern hemisphere radiation of the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/>\n\nTwo studies of the mitochondrial genome of both modern and extinct grey wolves (''Canis lupus'') have been conducted but these excluded the genetically divergent lineages of the Himalayan wolf and the Indian wolf. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with DNA sequences a time-based [[phylogenetic tree]] was generated for wolves. The study inferred that the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> An analysis of the Himalayan wolf mitochondrial genome indicates that the Himalayan wolf diverged between 740,000\u2014691,000 years ago from the lineage that would become the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the Himalayan wolf and Indian grey wolf were genetically closer to the [[African golden wolf]] than they were to the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> From 2017, two studies based on mDNA, and X-chromosome and Y-chromosome markers taken from the [[cell nucleus]], indicate that the Himalayan wolf is genetically basal to the Holarctic grey wolf. Its degree of divergence from the Holarctic grey wolf is similar to the degree of divergence of the African golden wolf from the Holarctic grey wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf. It possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the grey wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> The specimens used in these two studies show the high-elevation range of the Himalayan wolf to include the Himalayas then north across the Tibetan plateau to the [[Qinghai Lake]] in China's Qinghai Province.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\nIn 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The African golden wolf was found to be the descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72%&nbsp;grey wolf and 28%&nbsp;[[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> The Ethiopian wolf does not share the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that confer hypoxia adaptation with the Himalayan wolf. The adaptation of the Ethiopian wolf to living in high elevations may occur at other single-nucleotide polymorphism locations. This indicates that the Ethiopian wolf's adaptation has not been inherited by descent from a common ancestor shared with the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Himalayan wolf.JPG|thumb|Himalayan wolf profile]]\nThe Himalayan wolf has a thick woolly fur that is dull earthy-brown on the back and tail, and yellowish-white on the face, belly and limbs. It is about {{convert|45|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall at the shoulder.<ref name=hodgson1847/><ref name=blanford1888/><ref name=lydekker1900/><ref name=pocock1941/> It is larger than the [[Indian wolf]].<ref name=jerdon1874/> It has closely-spaced black speckles on the muzzle, below the eyes, on the upper cheeks and ears.<ref name=chetri2016/> It weighs about {{convert|35|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"shrotriya2012\" />\n\nThe heart of the Himalayan wolf withstands the low oxygen level at high elevations. It has a strong selection for RYR2, a gene that initiates cardiac excitation.<ref name=Zhang2014/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Pin Valley, Spiti.jpg|thumb|[[Pin Valley National Park]] located in Himachal Pradesh]]\nIn China, the Himalayan wolf lives on the Tibetan Plateau in the provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Qinghai]], Tibet,<ref name=smith2008/><ref name=wang2003/> and western [[Sichuan]].<ref name=Werhahn2020/>\n\nIn northern India, it occurs in the [[Ladakh]] region of eastern [[Kashmir]]<ref name=lydekker1900/> and in the [[Lahaul and Spiti]] region in northeastern [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref name=pocock1941/> In 2004, the Himalayan wolf population in India was estimated to consist of 350 individuals ranging across an area of about {{convert|70000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=sharma2004/>\nBetween 2005 and 2008, it was sighted in the alpine meadows above the tree line north-east of [[Nanda Devi National Park]] in [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=bhattacharya2010/> In 2013, a wolf was photographed by a camera trap installed at an elevation of about {{convert|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} near the Sunderdhunga Glacier in  Uttarakhand's [[Bageshwar district]].<ref name=pioneer2014/>\n\nIn Nepal, it was recorded in [[Api Nampa Conservation Area]], Upper [[Dolpo|Dolpa]], [[Holma]], [[Manaslu]], [[Upper Mustang]], and in [[Kanchenjunga Conservation Area]].<ref name=arnold2016/><ref name=werhahn2017b/> The Nepal Himalayas provide an important habitat refuge for the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nThe howls of the Himalayan wolf have lower frequencies and are shorter in duration. These howls are acoustically distinct and differ significantly from each other and from other wolf subspecies.<ref name=\"hennelly2017\"/>\n\n===Prey===\nHimalayan wolves prefer wild over domestic prey. They prefer the smaller [[Tibetan gazelle]] than the larger [[white-lipped deer]], and they prefer the plains-dwelling Tibetan gazelle over the cliff-dwelling [[naur]]. Supplementary food includes the small [[Himalayan marmot]], [[woolly hare]], and [[pikas]]. Himalayan wolves avoided livestock where wild prey is available, however habitat encroachment and the depletion of wild prey populations is forecast to lead to conflict with herders. To protect these wolves it will be important to secure healthy wild prey populations through setting aside wildlife habitat reserves and refuges.<ref name=Werhahn2019/> \n\nHistorical sources indicate that wolves occasionally killed children in Ladakh and [[Lahaul and Spiti|Lahoul]].<ref name=pocock1941/> Within the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary in Ladakh, the intensity of livestock depredation was assessed in three villages. The assessment found that Tibetan wolves were the most important predators accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the [[snow leopard]] and [[Eurasian lynx]]. The most frequent prey were [[domestic goat]]s (32%), followed by sheep (30%), [[yak]]s (15%), and [[horse]]s (13%). The wolves killed horses significantly more, and goats less, than would be expected from their relative abundance.<ref name=fox2007/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Canis lupus himalayensis.JPG|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling]]\nThe wolf in Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan is listed on [[CITES]] [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix I]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Species+: ''Canis lupus'' |website=CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC |year=2010 |url=https://speciesplus.net/#/taxon_concepts/4442/legal}}</ref>\nIn India, the wolf is protected under Schedule I of the ''[[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]'', which prohibits hunting; a zoo needs a permission from the government to acquire a wolf.

The group determined that the earliest available Latin name is ''Canis chanco'' Gray, 1863 but the geographic location of the [[holotype]] is unclear. The group recommends that this wolf lineage be known as the \"Himalayan wolf\" and classified as ''Canis lupus chanco'' until a genetic analysis of the holotypes is available.<ref name=Alvares2019/>\nIn 2020, further research on the Himalayan wolf indicates that it warrants species-level recognition under the Unified Species Concept, the Differential Fitness Species Concept, and the Biological Species Concept.

Results indicate that five related [[haplotypes]] formed a [[clade]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to all other wolves. This clade included one sample from [[Ladakh]], nine from the [[Spiti Valley]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], four from [[Nepal]], and two from [[Tibet]]. The Himalayan wolf clade diverged from other canids 800,000&nbsp;years ago. Seven wolves from [[Kashmir]] did not fall into this clade.<ref name=sharma2004/>\nThe mtDNA of 18 captive wolves in the [[Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park]] was analysed in 2007. Results showed that they shared a common female ancestor.<ref name=aggarwal2007/>\nAs this study was based on captive-bred zoo specimens that had descended from only two females, these samples were not considered to be representative. Additionally, the wolf population in the Kashmir valley is known to have recently arrived in that area.<ref name=shrotriya2012/><ref name=chetri2016/> Subsequent genetic research showed that wolf samples from Tibet are [[lineage (genetic)#Basal lineage|genetically basal]] to the [[Holarctic]] [[gray wolf]].<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=aggarwal2007b/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=miklosi2015/><ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=ersmark2016/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> Its [[MT-ND4L]] [[gene]] commences with the [[base pairs]] [[Guanine|G]]TG, whereas all other [[Canidae|canids]] commence with [[Adenine|A]]TG.<ref name=zhao2014/> Results of [[whole genome sequencing]] showed that it is the most [[Genetic divergence|genetically divergent]] wolf.<ref name=fan2016/>\n\nAnalysis of scat samples from two wolves collected in upper [[Dolpo]] matched the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=subba2012/> Fecal remains of four wolves collected in the [[upper Mustang]] region of the [[Annapurna Conservation Area]] also fell within the Himalayan wolf clade but formed a separate haplotype to those previously studied.<ref name=chetri2016/>\n\nThe Himalayan wolf population in Tibet declined over the past 25,000&nbsp;years and suffered a historical [[population bottleneck]]. Glaciation during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] may have caused habitat loss, genetic isolation and ancient inbreeding. On the other hand, the population in Qinghai had grown, showing a [[gene flow]] of 16% from Chinese indigenous dogs and 2% of the dingo's genome. It probably recolonised the Tibetan Plateau.<ref name=fan2016/>\nThe Himalayan wolf contrasts with the wolves living at lower elevations in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Xinjiang]] province. Some wolves in China and Mongolia also fall within the Himalayan wolf clade, indicating a common maternal ancestor and a wide distribution.<ref name=ersmark2016/> There was evidence of [[hybridization]] with the grey wolf at Sachyat-Ertash in the [[Issyk-Kul]] region of [[Kyrgyzstan]], and of [[introgression]] from either the grey wolf or the dog into the Himalayan wolf in Nepal.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n{{Cladogram|align=left |title=[[Phylogenetic tree]] of the extant wolf-like canids with timing in millions of years{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=mtdna_seq_desc|For a full set of supporting references refer to the note (a) in the phylotree at [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids]]}}|caption=<big>Blue shading represents the species ''Canis lupus''\n</big>\n|cladogram={{clade | style = font-size:85%;line-height:80%;width:550px;\n |label1=[[Caninae]] 3.5&nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]]\n |1={{clade\n  |label1=3.0\n  |1={{clade\n   |label1=2.5\n   |1={{clade\n    |label1=2.0\n    |1={{clade\n     |label1=0.96\n     |1={{clade\n       |label1=0.60\n       |1={{clade\n        |label1=0.38 \n        |1={{clade\n        |style1=background-color:#ccccff;\n         |label1=0.25\n         |1={{clade\n          |label1=0.12\n          |1={{clade\n           |label1=0.08\n           |1={{clade\n            |label1=0.031 \n            |1={{clade\n             |1=[[Dog|Domestic dog]] [[File:Tibetan mastiff (transparent background).png|50 px]]\n             |2=Holarctic [[Wolf|grey wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n             }}\n            |2=[[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]]\u2020 [[File:The_American_Museum_journal_(c1900-(1918))_(Canis_dirus)_transparent_background.png|60 px]]\n            }}\n            |2=[[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian plains wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n           }}\n           |2='''Himalayan wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n          }}\n         |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n         }}\n        |2={{clade\n         |1=[[African golden wolf]] northwestern Africa[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n         |2=African golden wolf eastern Africa[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n        }}\n        |label2=0.11\n       }}\n       |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).jpg|50 px]]\n       }}\n      |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).jpg|50 px]]\n      }}\n     |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).jpg|50 px]]\n     }}\n     |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).jpg|50 px]]\n   }}\n  |2={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n    |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).jpg|50 px]]\n    |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).jpg|50 px]]\n    }}\n    |label1=2.6\n   }}\n  }}\n }}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n[[DNA sequences]] can be mapped to reveal a [[phylogenetic tree]] that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor.

The Tibetan Mastiff's ability to avoid [[Hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxia]] in high altitudes, due to its higher [[hemoglobin]] levels compared to low-altitude dogs, was due to prehistoric interbreeding with the wolves of Tibet.<ref name=Miao2016/><ref name=Signore2019/>\n\n===Relationship with the African golden wolf===\n[[File:Himalayan wolves.jpg|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in [[Darjeeling]]]]\nIn 2011, it was proposed that the [[Indian wolf]], Himalayan wolf, and [[African golden wolf]] represent ancient wolf lineages, with the African golden wolf having colonised Africa prior to the northern hemisphere radiation of the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/>\n\nTwo studies of the mitochondrial genome of both modern and extinct grey wolves (''Canis lupus'') have been conducted but these excluded the genetically divergent lineages of the Himalayan wolf and the Indian wolf. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with DNA sequences a time-based [[phylogenetic tree]] was generated for wolves. The study inferred that the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> An analysis of the Himalayan wolf mitochondrial genome indicates that the Himalayan wolf diverged between 740,000\u2014691,000 years ago from the lineage that would become the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the Himalayan wolf and Indian grey wolf were genetically closer to the [[African golden wolf]] than they were to the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> From 2017, two studies based on mDNA, and X-chromosome and Y-chromosome markers taken from the [[cell nucleus]], indicate that the Himalayan wolf is genetically basal to the Holarctic grey wolf. Its degree of divergence from the Holarctic grey wolf is similar to the degree of divergence of the African golden wolf from the Holarctic grey wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf. It possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the grey wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> The specimens used in these two studies show the high-elevation range of the Himalayan wolf to include the Himalayas then north across the Tibetan plateau to the [[Qinghai Lake]] in China's Qinghai Province.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\nIn 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The African golden wolf was found to be the descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72%&nbsp;grey wolf and 28%&nbsp;[[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> The Ethiopian wolf does not share the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that confer hypoxia adaptation with the Himalayan wolf. The adaptation of the Ethiopian wolf to living in high elevations may occur at other single-nucleotide polymorphism locations. This indicates that the Ethiopian wolf's adaptation has not been inherited by descent from a common ancestor shared with the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Himalayan wolf.JPG|thumb|Himalayan wolf profile]]\nThe Himalayan wolf has a thick woolly fur that is dull earthy-brown on the back and tail, and yellowish-white on the face, belly and limbs. It is about {{convert|45|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall at the shoulder.<ref name=hodgson1847/><ref name=blanford1888/><ref name=lydekker1900/><ref name=pocock1941/> It is larger than the [[Indian wolf]].<ref name=jerdon1874/> It has closely-spaced black speckles on the muzzle, below the eyes, on the upper cheeks and ears.<ref name=chetri2016/> It weighs about {{convert|35|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"shrotriya2012\" />\n\nThe heart of the Himalayan wolf withstands the low oxygen level at high elevations.

These howls are acoustically distinct and differ significantly from each other and from other wolf subspecies.<ref name=\"hennelly2017\"/>\n\n===Prey===\nHimalayan wolves prefer wild over domestic prey. They prefer the smaller [[Tibetan gazelle]] than the larger [[white-lipped deer]], and they prefer the plains-dwelling Tibetan gazelle over the cliff-dwelling [[naur]]. Supplementary food includes the small [[Himalayan marmot]], [[woolly hare]], and [[pikas]]. Himalayan wolves avoided livestock where wild prey is available, however habitat encroachment and the depletion of wild prey populations is forecast to lead to conflict with herders. To protect these wolves it will be important to secure healthy wild prey populations through setting aside wildlife habitat reserves and refuges.<ref name=Werhahn2019/> \n\nHistorical sources indicate that wolves occasionally killed children in Ladakh and [[Lahaul and Spiti|Lahoul]].<ref name=pocock1941/> Within the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary in Ladakh, the intensity of livestock depredation was assessed in three villages. The assessment found that Tibetan wolves were the most important predators accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the [[snow leopard]] and [[Eurasian lynx]]. The most frequent prey were [[domestic goat]]s (32%), followed by sheep (30%), [[yak]]s (15%), and [[horse]]s (13%). The wolves killed horses significantly more, and goats less, than would be expected from their relative abundance.<ref name=fox2007/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Canis lupus himalayensis.JPG|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling]]\nThe wolf in Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan is listed on [[CITES]] [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix I]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Species+: ''Canis lupus'' |website=CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC |year=2010 |url=https://speciesplus.net/#/taxon_concepts/4442/legal}}</ref>\nIn India, the wolf is protected under Schedule I of the ''[[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]'', which prohibits hunting; a zoo needs a permission from the government to acquire a wolf.
