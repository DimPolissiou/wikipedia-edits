Email entered limited use in the 1960s, but users could only send to users of the same computer, and some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be [[Online and offline|online]] simultaneously, similar to [[instant messaging]]. [[Ray Tomlinson]] is credited as the inventor of email; in 1971, he developed the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts across the ARPANET, using the @ sign to link the user name with a destination server. By the mid-1970s, this was the form recognized as email.\n\nEmail operates across [[computer network]]s, primarily the [[Internet access|Internet]]. Today's email systems are based on a [[store-and-forward]] model. Email [[Server (computing)|servers]] accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] or a [[webmail]] interface to send or receive messages or download it.\n\nOriginally an [[ASCII]] text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments. [[International email]], with internationalized email addresses using [[UTF-8]], is standardized but not widely adopted.<ref name=first/>\n\nThe history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early [[ARPANET]], with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561). An email message sent in the early 1970s is similar to a basic email sent today. <!-- The Partridge reference does not support the claim \"Email had an important role in creating the Internet\" -->\n\n==Terminology==\nHistorically, the term ''electronic mail'' is any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to refer to [[fax]] document transmission.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Ron|last=Brown|title=Fax invades the mail market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|volume=56|issue=817|publisher=New Scientist Ltd.|location=London, England|date=October 26, 1972|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 |archive-date=May 9, 2016|pages=218\u2013221}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Herbert P.|last=Luckett|title=What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&pg=PA85|magazine=[[Popular Science]]|publisher=[[Bonnier Corporation]]|location=Harlan, Iowa|volume=202|issue=3|date=March 1973|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021738/https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&pg=PA85 |archive-date=April 30, 2016|page=85}}</ref> As a result, finding its first use is difficult with the specific meaning it has today.\n\nElectronic mail is called ''email'' or ''e-mail'' since around 1993,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+mail%2Ce-mail&year_start=1980&year_end=1995&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share= |title=Google Ngram Viewer |accessdate=2013-04-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516172701/http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+mail%2Ce-mail&year_start=1980&year_end=1995&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share= |archivedate=2013-05-16 }}</ref> but several variations of the spelling are used:\n\n* ''email'' is now the common form, and recommended by [[style guide]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://styleguide.yahoo.com/word-list/e|title=Yahoo style guide|publisher=Styleguide.yahoo.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509154006/http://styleguide.yahoo.com/word-list/e|archive-date=May 9, 2013|url-status=|accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref name=\"aces2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/18/ap-removes-hyphen-from-em_n_837833.html|title=AP Removes Hyphen From 'Email' In Style Guide|website=[[Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=March 18, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512055628/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/18/ap-removes-hyphen-from-em_n_837833.html |archive-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> It is the form required by [[IETF]] [[Request for Comments|Requests for Comments]] (RFC) and working groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-style-guide/terms-online.txt|publisher=IETF|title=RFC Editor Terms List|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228152111/http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-style-guide/terms-online.txt|archivedate=2013-12-28}} This is suggested by the [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-style-guide/rfc-style-manual-08.txt RFC Document Style Guide]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002009/http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-style-guide/rfc-style-manual-08.txt |date=2015-04-24 }}</ref>  This spelling also appears in most dictionaries.<ref name=\"AskOxford Language Query team\">{{cite web | url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/email | title=What is the correct way to spell 'e' words such as 'email', 'ecommerce', 'egovernment'?

Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the ARPANET (created in the late 1960s), which aimed at [[software portability]] between its systems.  In 1971 the first ARPANET network email was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the '@' symbol designating the user's system address.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ray Tomlinson |url=http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html |title=The First Network Email |publisher=Openmap.bbn.com |accessdate=2019-10-05}}</ref> The [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) protocol was introduced in 1981.\n\nFor a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the [[X.400]] email system, part of the [[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile]] (GOSIP), would predominate.

The part before the @ sign is the ''local part'' of the address, often the [[username]] of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a [[domain name]]. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the [[fully qualified domain name]] of the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n# The [[DNS server]] for the domain ''b.org'' (''ns.b.org'') responds with any [[MX record]]s listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case ''mx.b.org'', a [[message transfer agent]] (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.<ref>[https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html \"MX Record Explanation\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117204846/https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html |date=2015-01-17 }}, it.cornell.edu</ref>\n# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP.

These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.\n* Alice may not have an MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a [[webmail]] service.\n* Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1. \n* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.\n* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.\n\nMany MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them.

The recipient's client may display the time in the format and time zone local to them.\n\nRFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]; it provides for [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html permanent] and [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html provisional] field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064 |title=RFC 5064 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=December 2007 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725215530/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064 |archivedate=2014-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n* ''To'': The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message's recipient(s). Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.\n* ''Subject'': A brief summary of the topic of the message. [[E-mail subject abbreviations|Certain abbreviations]] are commonly used in the subject, including [[E-mail subject abbreviations|\"RE:\" and \"FW:\"]].\n* ''Cc'': [[Carbon copy]]; Many email clients mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list.\n* ''Bcc'': [[Blind carbon copy]]; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.\n* [[Content-Type]]: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a [[MIME]] type.\n* ''Precedence'': commonly with values \"bulk\", \"junk\", or \"list\"; used to indicate automated \"vacation\" or \"out of office\" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. [[Sendmail]] uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with \"Precedence: special-delivery\" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it was. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the ''X-Auto-Response-Suppress'' field.<ref>Microsoft, Auto Response Suppress, 2010, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx Microsoft reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407033540/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx |date=2011-04-07 }}, 2010 Sep 22</ref>\n* ''[[Message-ID]]'': Also an automatic-generated field to prevent multiple deliveries and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).\n* ''In-Reply-To'': [[Message-ID]] of the message this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies to reply messages.\n* ''References'': [[Message-ID]] of the message this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.\n* ''Reply-To'': Address should be used to reply to the message.\n* ''Sender'': Address of the sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).\n* ''Archived-At'': A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.\n\nThe ''To:'' field may be unrelated to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], which may be extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field may not be the sender. Some mail servers apply [[email authentication]] systems to messages relayed. Data pertaining to the server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.\n\nSMTP defines the ''trace information'' of a message saved in the header using the following two fields:<ref>{{cite IETF|title=Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|rfc=5321|author=[[John Klensin]]|sectionname=Trace Information|section=4.4| date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n* ''Received'': after an SMTP server accepts a message, it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).\n* ''Return-Path'': after the delivery SMTP server makes the ''final delivery'' of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.\n\nOther fields added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called ''trace fields''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|title=Trace headers|author=John Levine|date=14 January 2012|work=email message|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=16 January 2012|quote=there are many more trace fields than those two|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811135249/http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|archivedate=11 August 2012}}</ref>\n* ''Authentication-Results'': after a server verifies authentication, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.<ref>This extensible field is defined by RFC 7001, this also defines an [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] registry of [http://www.iana.org/assignments/email-auth/ Email Authentication Parameters].</ref>\n* ''Received-SPF'': stores results of [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.<ref>RFC 7208.</ref>\n* ''DKIM-Signature'': stores results of [[DomainKeys Identified Mail]] (DKIM) decryption to verify the message was not changed after it was sent.<ref name=\"DKIM\">{{cite web |title=RFC6376 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376 |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n* ''Auto-Submitted'': is used to mark automatic-generated messages.<ref>Defined in RFC 3834, and updated by RFC 5436.</ref>\n* ''VBR-Info'': claims [[Vouch by Reference|VBR]] whitelisting<ref>RFC 5518.</ref>\n\n===Message body===\n\n====Content encoding====\nInternet email was designed for 7-bit ASCII.<ref>{{cite book|title=TCP/IP Network Administration|year=2002|isbn=978-0-596-00297-8|author=Craig Hunt|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|page=70}}</ref> Most email software is [[8-bit clean]], but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The [[MIME]] standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: [[quoted printable]] for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and [[base64]] for arbitrary binary data. The [[8BITMIME]] and [[BINARY]] extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many [[mail transport agent]]s may not support them. In some countries, several encoding schemes co-exist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is a coincidence if the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international [[character set]]s, [[Unicode]] is growing in popularity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Plain text and HTML====\nMost modern graphic [[email client]]s allow the use of either [[plain text]] or [[HTML#HTML email|HTML]] for the message body at the option of the user. [[HTML email]] messages often include an automatic-generated plain text copy for compatibility. Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in [[block quote]]s, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as [[underline]]s and [[italics]], and change [[font]] styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about [[web bug]]s, abuse of HTML email as a vector for [[phishing]] attacks and the spread of [[malware|malicious software]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|title=Email policies that prevent viruses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512053927/http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|archive-date=2007-05-12|url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref>\n\nSome web-based [[mailing list]]s recommend all posts be made in plain-text, with 72 or 80 [[characters per line]] for all the above reasons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |title=When posting to a RootsWeb mailing list... |publisher=Helpdesk.rootsweb.com |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219024856/http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |archivedate=2014-02-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html |title=...Plain text, 72 characters per line... |publisher=Openbsd.org |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208005706/http://openbsd.org/mail.html |archivedate=2014-02-08 }}</ref> and because they have a significant number of readers using [[List of email clients#Text-based|text-based email clients]] such as [[Mutt (email client)|Mutt]].

See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nMessages are exchanged between hosts using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] with software programs called [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called [[mail delivery agent]]s (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it,<ref>In practice, some accepted messages may nowadays not be delivered to the recipient's InBox, but instead to a Spam or Junk folder which, especially in a corporate environment, may be inaccessible to the recipient</ref> and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a [[bounce message]] back to the sender, indicating the problem.\n\nUsers can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[IMAP]], or, as is more likely in a large [[corporation|corporate]] environment, with a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] protocol specific to [[Novell Groupwise]], [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]s.  Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called [[mail user agent]]s (MUAs).\n\nMail can be stored on the [[client (computing)|client]], on the [[Server (computing)|server]] side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include [[Maildir]] and [[mbox]]. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as [[IMAP]], moving email from one server to another can be done with any [[Mail user agent|MUA]] supporting the protocol.\n\nMany current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as [[Gmail]] or [[Yahoo! Mail]], that performs the same tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/|title=Free Email Providers in the Yahoo!

Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the ''[[mbox]]'' format. The specific format used is often indicated by special [[filename extension]]s:\n;<code>eml</code>\n:Used by many email clients including [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Microsoft Outlook Express]], [[Lotus notes]], [[Windows Mail]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as [[plain text]] in [[MIME]] format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.\n;<code>emlx</code>\n:Used by [[Apple Mail]].\n;<code>msg</code>\n:Used by [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Office Outlook]] and [[OfficeLogic|OfficeLogic Groupware]].\n;<code>mbx</code>\n:Used by [[Opera Mail]], [[KMail]], and [[Apple Mail]] based on the [[mbox]] format.\n\nSome applications (like [[Apple Mail]]) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.\n\n===URI scheme mailto===\n{{main|mailto}}\nThe [[URI scheme]], as registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], defines the <code>mailto:</code> scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the ''To:'' field.<ref>RFC 2368 section 3 : by Paul Hoffman in 1998 discusses operation of the \"mailto\" URL.</ref><ref name=\"Barnett 2011 p. 245\" /> Many clients also support query string parameters for the other email fields, such as its subject line or carbon copy recipients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks|title=Creating hyperlinks \u00a7 E-mail links|website=MDN Web Docs|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Web-based email===\n{{main|Webmail}}\nMany email providers have a web-based email client (e.g. [[AOL Mail]], [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]]). This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible [[web browser]] to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the client, so can't be read without a current Internet connection.\n\n===POP3 email servers===\nThe [[Post Office Protocol]] 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the [[server (computing)|server]]. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).<ref name=\"Windows to Linux\">{{cite book | last = Allen | first = David | title = Windows to Linux | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | page = 192 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks#v=onepage | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161226051835/https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage | archivedate = 2016-12-26 | isbn = 978-1423902454 }}</ref>\n\n===IMAP email servers===\nThe [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like [[smartphone]]s are increasingly used to check email while traveling and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually, the mail is left in folders in the mail server.\n\n===MAPI email servers===\n[[MAPI|Messaging Application Programming Interface]] (MAPI) is used by [[Microsoft Outlook]] to communicate to [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] - and to a range of other email server products such as [[Axigen|Axigen Mail Server]], [[Kerio Connect]], [[Scalix]], [[Zimbra]], [[HP OpenMail]], [[IBM Lotus Notes]], [[Zarafa (software)|Zarafa]], and [[Bynari]] where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.\n\n==Uses==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Business and organizational use===\nEmail has been widely accepted by businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an 'e-revolution' in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed [[Internet]]).

Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.\n; Helping with synchronization\n: With [[Real-time computing|real time]] communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows [[wikt:asynchrony|asynchrony]]: each participant may control their schedule independently.\n; Reducing cost\n: Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or [[long distance telephone call]]s, [[telex]] or [[telegrams]].\n; Increasing speed\n: Much faster than most of the alternatives.\n; Creating a \"written\" record\n: Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.\n\n====Email marketing====\n[[Email marketing]] via \"[[opt-in email|opt-in]]\" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information.<ref name=brett>{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.

While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other devices to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. {{As of|2011}}, there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.<ref name=\"Barnett 2011 p. 245\">{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Derek |last2=Smith |first2=Marc A. |last3=Heer |first3=Jeffrey |author-link3=Jeffrey Heer |chapter=E-Mail |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage |editor1-last=Barnett |editor1-first=George A |title=Encyclopedia of social networks |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2011 |isbn=9781412994170 |page=245 |oclc=959670912}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals often check emails on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages.

These range from [[List of email scams|various types of email scams]], including [[Social engineering (security)|\"social engineering\"]] scams such as [[advance-fee scam]] \"Nigerian letters\", to [[phishing]], [[email bomb]]ardment and [[Computer worm|email worms]].\n\n===Email spoofing===\n{{Main|Email spoofing}}\n[[Email spoofing]] occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. [[Email spam]] and [[phishing]] methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email that appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\n\n===Email bombing===\n{{main|Email bomb}}\n\n[[Email bomb]]ing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\n{{Main|Email privacy}}\n\nToday it can be important to distinguish between the Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, maybe more secure, although [[information technology]] personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\n\nEmail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\n* email messages are generally not encrypted.\n* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.\n* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.\n* the \"Received:\"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.\n* [[web bug]]s invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read, or re-read, and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the [[user agent string]].\n\nThere are [[cryptography]] applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, [[Virtual Private Network]]s or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], SMEmail,<ref>[http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3176 SMEmail \u2013 A New Protocol for the Secure E-mail in Mobile Environments], Proceedings of the Australian Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC'08), pp. 39\u201344, Adelaide, Australia, Dec. 2008.</ref> or [[S/MIME]] can be used for [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over [[Transport Layer Security]]/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\n\nAdditionally, many [[mail user agent]]s do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] prevent this. Finally, the attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer filesharing]]. Attached files may contain [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or [[Computer virus|viruses]].\n\n===Legal contracts===\nEmails can now often be considered as binding contracts as well, so users must be careful about what they send through email correspondence.<ref>https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202794877741/When-Email-Exchanges-Become-Binding-Contracts/</ref><ref>https://www.upcounsel.com/is-an-email-legally-binding</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Corfield |first1=Gareth |title=UK court ruling says email signature blocks can sign binding contracts |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/30/email_signature_legally_binding_contract/ |accessdate=6 December 2019 |work=The Register}}</ref>\n\n===Flaming===\n[[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word ''incendiary'' to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the [[social norms]] that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S. Kiesler |author2=D. Zubrow |author3=A.M. Moses |author4=V. Geller |title=Affect in computer-mediated communication: an experiment in synchronous terminal-to-terminal discussion|journal=Human-Computer Interaction|volume=1|pages=77\u2013104|year=1985|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0101_3}}</ref>\n\n===Email bankruptcy===\n{{main|Email bankruptcy}}\nAlso known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.<ref>{{cite news|title=All We Are Saying.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24|first=Grant|last=Barrett|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094849/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html|archivedate=April 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nOriginally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based.

It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] introduced [[Delivery Status Notification]]s (delivery receipts) and [[Return receipt#Email|Message Disposition Notifications]] (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production. (A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined, but it never gained traction; see RFCs 3885<ref>RFC 3885, ''SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking''</ref> through 3888.<ref>RFC 3888, ''Message Tracking Model and Requirements''</ref>)\n\nMany ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\n* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.\n* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ([[email spoofing]]), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user.\n\nIn the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of [[web bug]]s have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D9143AF931A15752C1A9669C8B63|title=Software That Tracks E-Mail Is Raising Privacy Concerns|author=Amy Harmon|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Email.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102000000/http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |archivedate=2018-01-02 }}</ref> and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML.

Email entered limited use in the 1960s, but users could only send to users of the same computer, and some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be [[Online and offline|online]] simultaneously, similar to [[instant messaging]]. [[Ray Tomlinson]] is credited as the inventor of email; in 1971, he developed the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts across the ARPANET, using the @ sign to link the user name with a destination server. By the mid-1970s, this was the form recognized as email. \n\nEmail operates across [[computer network]]s, primarily the [[Internet access|Internet]]. Today's email systems are based on a [[store-and-forward]] model. Email [[Server (computing)|servers]] accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] or a [[webmail]] interface to send or receive messages or download it.\n\nOriginally an [[ASCII]] text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments.

Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the [[ARPANET]] (created in the late 1960s), which aimed at [[software portability]] between its systems.  In 1971 the first ARPANET network email was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the '@' symbol designating the user's system address.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ray Tomlinson |url=http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html |title=The First Network Email |publisher=Openmap.bbn.com |accessdate=2019-10-05}}</ref> The [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) protocol was introduced in 1981.\n\nFor a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the [[X.400]] email system, part of the [[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile]] (GOSIP), would predominate.

The part before the @ sign is the ''local part'' of the address, often the [[username]] of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a [[domain name]]. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the [[fully qualified domain name]] of the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n# The [[DNS server]] for the domain ''b.org'' (''ns.b.org'') responds with any [[MX record]]s listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case ''mx.b.org'', a [[message transfer agent]] (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.<ref>[https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html \"MX Record Explanation\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117204846/https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html |date=2015-01-17 }}, it.cornell.edu</ref>\n# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP.

These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.\n* Alice may not have an MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a [[webmail]] service.\n* Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1. \n* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.\n* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.\n\nMany MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them.

The delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], which may be extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field may not be the sender. Some mail servers apply [[email authentication]] systems to messages relayed.

The [[MIME]] standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: [[quoted printable]] for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and [[base64]] for arbitrary binary data. The [[8BITMIME]] and [[BINARY]] extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many [[mail transport agent]]s may not support them. In some countries, several encoding schemes co-exist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is a coincidence if the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international [[character set]]s, [[Unicode]] is growing in popularity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Plain text and HTML====\nMost modern graphic [[email client]]s allow the use of either [[plain text]] or [[HTML#HTML email|HTML]] for the message body at the option of the user. [[HTML email]] messages often include an automatic-generated plain text copy for compatibility. Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in [[block quote]]s, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as [[underline]]s and [[italics]], and change [[font]] styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about [[web bug]]s, abuse of HTML email as a vector for [[phishing]] attacks and the spread of [[malware|malicious software]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|title=Email policies that prevent viruses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512053927/http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|archive-date=2007-05-12|url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref>\n\nSome web-based [[mailing list]]s recommend all posts be made in plain-text, with 72 or 80 [[characters per line]] for all the above reasons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |title=When posting to a RootsWeb mailing list... |publisher=Helpdesk.rootsweb.com |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219024856/http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |archivedate=2014-02-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html |title=...Plain text, 72 characters per line... |publisher=Openbsd.org |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208005706/http://openbsd.org/mail.html |archivedate=2014-02-08 }}</ref>, and because they have a significant number of readers using [[List of email clients#Text-based|text-based email clients]] such as [[Mutt (email client)|Mutt]].

See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nMessages are exchanged between hosts using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] with software programs called [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called [[mail delivery agent]]s (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it,<ref>In practice, some accepted messages may nowadays not be delivered to the recipient's InBox, but instead to a Spam or Junk folder which, especially in a corporate environment, may be inaccessible to the recipient</ref> and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a [[bounce message]] back to the sender, indicating the problem.\n\nUsers can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[IMAP]], or, as is more likely in a large [[corporation|corporate]] environment, with a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] protocol specific to [[Novell Groupwise]], [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]s.  Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called [[mail user agent]]s (MUAs).\n\nMail can be stored on the [[client (computing)|client]], on the [[Server (computing)|server]] side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include [[Maildir]] and [[mbox]]. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as [[IMAP]], moving email from one server to another can be done with any [[Mail user agent|MUA]] supporting the protocol.\n\nMany current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as [[Gmail]] or [[Yahoo! Mail]], that performs the same tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/|title=Free Email Providers in the Yahoo!

Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the ''[[mbox]]'' format. The specific format used is often indicated by special [[filename extension]]s:\n;<code>eml</code>\n:Used by many email clients including [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Microsoft Outlook Express]], [[Lotus notes]], [[Windows Mail]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as [[plain text]] in [[MIME]] format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.\n;<code>emlx</code>\n:Used by [[Apple Mail]].\n;<code>msg</code>\n:Used by [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Office Outlook]] and [[OfficeLogic|OfficeLogic Groupware]].\n;<code>mbx</code>\n:Used by [[Opera Mail]], [[KMail]], and [[Apple Mail]] based on the [[mbox]] format.\n\nSome applications (like [[Apple Mail]]) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.\n\n===URI scheme mailto===\n{{main|mailto}}\nThe [[URI scheme]], as registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], defines the <code>mailto:</code> scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the ''To:'' field.<ref>RFC 2368 section 3 : by Paul Hoffman in 1998 discusses operation of the \"mailto\" URL.</ref><ref name=\"Barnett 2011 p. 245\" /> Many clients also support query string parameters for the other email fields, such as its subject line or carbon copy recipients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks|title=Creating hyperlinks \u00a7 E-mail links|website=MDN Web Docs|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Web-based email===\n{{main|Webmail}}\nMany email providers have a web-based email client (e.g. [[AOL Mail]], [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]]). This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible [[web browser]] to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the client, so can't be read without a current Internet connection.\n\n===POP3 email servers===\nThe [[Post Office Protocol]] 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the [[server (computing)|server]]. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).<ref name=\"Windows to Linux\">{{cite book | last = Allen | first = David | title = Windows to Linux | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | page = 192 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks#v=onepage | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161226051835/https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage | archivedate = 2016-12-26 | isbn = 978-1423902454 }}</ref>\n\n===IMAP email servers===\nThe [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like [[smartphone]]s are increasingly used to check email while traveling and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually, the mail is left in folders in the mail server.\n\n===MAPI email servers===\n[[MAPI|Messaging Application Programming Interface]] (MAPI) is used by [[Microsoft Outlook]] to communicate to [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] - and to a range of other email server products such as [[Axigen|Axigen Mail Server]], [[Kerio Connect]], [[Scalix]], [[Zimbra]], [[HP OpenMail]], [[IBM Lotus Notes]], [[Zarafa (software)|Zarafa]], and [[Bynari]] where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Business and organizational use===\nEmail has been widely accepted by businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an 'e-revolution' in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed [[Internet]]). A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.<ref name=om>By Om Malik, GigaOm. \"[http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ Is Email a Curse or a Boon?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012735/http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ |date=2010-12-04 }}\" September 22, 2010.

Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.\n; Helping with synchronization\n: With [[Real-time computing|real time]] communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows [[wikt:asynchrony|asynchrony]]: each participant may control their schedule independently.\n; Reducing cost\n: Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or [[long distance telephone call]]s, [[telex]] or [[telegrams]].\n; Increasing speed\n: Much faster than most of the alternatives.\n; Creating a \"written\" record\n: Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.\n\n====Email marketing====\n[[Email marketing]] via \"[[opt-in email|opt-in]]\" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information.<ref name=brett>{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.

While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other devices to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. {{As of|2011}}, there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.<ref name=\"Barnett 2011 p. 245\">{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Derek |last2=Smith |first2=Marc A. |last3=Heer |first3=Jeffrey |author-link3=Jeffrey Heer |chapter=E-Mail |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage |editor1-last=Barnett |editor1-first=George A |title=Encyclopedia of social networks |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2011 |isbn=9781412994170 |page=245 |oclc=959670912}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals often check emails on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages.

These range from [[List of email scams|various types of email scams]], including [[Social engineering (security)|\"social engineering\"]] scams such as [[advance-fee scam]] \"Nigerian letters\", to [[phishing]], [[email bomb]]ardment and [[Computer worm|email worms]].\n\n===Email spoofing===\n{{Main|Email spoofing}}\n[[Email spoofing]] occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. [[Email spam]] and [[phishing]] methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email that appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\n\n===Email bombing===\n{{main|Email bomb}}\n\n[[Email bomb]]ing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\n{{Main|Email privacy}}\n\nToday it can be important to distinguish between the Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, maybe more secure, although [[information technology]] personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\n\nEmail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\n* email messages are generally not encrypted.\n* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.\n* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.\n* the \"Received:\"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.\n* [[web bug]]s invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read, or re-read, and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the [[user agent string]].\n\nThere are [[cryptography]] applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, [[Virtual Private Network]]s or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], SMEmail,<ref>[http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3176 SMEmail \u2013 A New Protocol for the Secure E-mail in Mobile Environments], Proceedings of the Australian Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC'08), pp. 39\u201344, Adelaide, Australia, Dec. 2008.</ref> or [[S/MIME]] can be used for [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over [[Transport Layer Security]]/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\n\nAdditionally, many [[mail user agent]]s do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] prevent this. Finally, the attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer filesharing]]. Attached files may contain [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or [[Computer virus|viruses]]. \n\n===Legal contracts===\nEmails can now often be considered as binding contracts as well, so users must be careful about what they send through email correspondence. <ref>https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202794877741/When-Email-Exchanges-Become-Binding-Contracts/</ref><ref>https://www.upcounsel.com/is-an-email-legally-binding</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Corfield |first1=Gareth |title=UK court ruling says email signature blocks can sign binding contracts |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/30/email_signature_legally_binding_contract/ |accessdate=6 December 2019 |work=The Register}}</ref>\n\n===Flaming===\n[[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word ''incendiary'' to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the [[social norms]] that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S. Kiesler |author2=D. Zubrow |author3=A.M. Moses |author4=V. Geller |title=Affect in computer-mediated communication: an experiment in synchronous terminal-to-terminal discussion|journal=Human-Computer Interaction|volume=1|pages=77\u2013104|year=1985|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0101_3}}</ref>\n\n===Email bankruptcy===\n{{main|Email bankruptcy}}\nAlso known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.<ref>{{cite news|title=All We Are Saying.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24|first=Grant|last=Barrett|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094849/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html|archivedate=April 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nOriginally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based.

It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] introduced [[Delivery Status Notification]]s (delivery receipts) and [[Return receipt#Email|Message Disposition Notifications]] (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production. (A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined, but it never gained traction; see RFCs 3885<ref>RFC 3885, ''SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking''</ref> through 3888.<ref>RFC 3888, ''Message Tracking Model and Requirements''</ref>)\n\nMany ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\n* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.\n* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ([[email spoofing]]), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user.\n\nIn the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of [[web bug]]s have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D9143AF931A15752C1A9669C8B63|title=Software That Tracks E-Mail Is Raising Privacy Concerns|author=Amy Harmon|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Email.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102000000/http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |archivedate=2018-01-02 }}</ref> and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML.

Similarly, in a scene in his [[Henry VI, Part 1]], English noblemen pick either red or white roses to symbolize their alliegance to the Houses of Lancaster or York.\n\nInterest in floriography soared in [[Victorian England]] and in the [[United States]] during the 19th century. Gifts of blooms, plants, and specific floral arrangements were used to send a coded message to the recipient, allowing the sender to express feelings which could not be spoken aloud in Victorian society.<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/languageofflower00gree | title = Language of Flowers | first = Kate | last = Greenaway | location = London | publisher = George Routledge and Sons | year = }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Tussie-Mussies: the Victorian Art of Expressing Yourself in the Language of Flowers |url=https://archive.org/details/tussiemussiesvic00lauf |url-access=registration | first = Geraldine Adamich | last = Laufer |publisher=Workman Publishing |year=1993}}</ref> Armed with floral dictionaries, Victorians often exchanged small \"talking bouquets\", called nosegays or [[tussie-mussies]], which could be worn or carried as a fashion accessory.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Floral poetry and the language of flowers (1877) (14782868105).jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''Floral poetry and the language of flowers'' (1877)]]\nAccording to Jayne Alcock, Grounds and Gardens Supervisor at [[The Walled Gardens of Cannington]], the renewed [[Victorian era]] interest in the language of flowers finds its roots in [[Ottoman Turkey]], specifically the court in [[Constantinople]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk/blog/post/?id=19|title = The Language of Flowers|website = Bridgwater College|access-date = 2016-03-29|date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> and an obsession it held with [[tulips]] during the first half of the 18th century. The Victorian use of flowers as a means of covert communication bloomed alongside a growing interest in [[botany]].\n\nThe floriography craze was introduced to Europe by two people: Englishwoman [[Mary Wortley Montagu]] (1689\u20131762), who brought it to [[England]] in 1717, and Aubry de La Mottraye (1674\u20131743), who introduced it to the Swedish court in 1727. Joseph Hammer-Purgstall's ''Dictionnaire du language des fleurs'' (1809) appears to be the first published list associating flowers with symbolic definitions, while the first dictionary of floriography appears in 1819 when Louise Cortambert, writing under pen name Madame Charlotte de la Tour, wrote ''Le langage des Fleurs''.\n\nFloriography was popularized in [[France]] during 1810\u20131850, while in Britain it was popular during the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] age (roughly 1820\u20131880), and in the [[United States]] during 1830\u20131850. La Tour's book stimulated the publishing industry especially in France, England, and the United States, but also in [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and other European countries as well as in [[South America]]. Publishers from these countries produced hundreds of editions of floriography books during the 19th century.\n\nBritish floral dictionaries include [[Henry Phillips (horticulturist)|Henry Phillips]]' ''Floral Emblems'' published in 1825 and [[Frederic Shoberl]]'s ''The Language of Flowers; With Illustrative Poetry'', in 1834. Shoberl was the editor of the popular annual \"Forget Me Not\" from 1822 to 1834. [[Robert Tyas]] was a popular British flower writer, publisher, and clergyman, who lived from 1811 to 1879; his book, ''The Sentiment of Flowers; or, Language of Flora'', first published in 1836 and printed through the 1840s, was billed as an English version of [[Charlotte de la Tour]]'s book. One of the most familiar books about floriography is Routledge's edition illustrated by [[Kate Greenaway]], ''The Language of Flowers''. First published in 1884, it continues to be reprinted to this day.\n\nIn the United States the first appearance of the language of flowers in print was in the writings of [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]], a French-American naturalist, who wrote on-going features under the title \"The School of Flora\", from 1827 through 1828, in the weekly [[Saturday Evening Post]] and the monthly ''Casket; or Flowers of Literature, Wit, and Sentiment''. These pieces contained the botanic, English, and French names of the plant, a description of the plant, an explanation of its Latin names, and the flower's emblematic meaning. However, the first books on floriography were [[Elizabeth Wirt]]'s ''Flora's Dictionary'' and [[Dorothea Dix]]'s ''The Garland of Flora'', both of which were published in 1829, though Wirt's book had been issued in an unauthorized edition in 1828.\n\nDuring its peak in the United States, the language of flowers attracted the attention of popular female writers and editors. [[Sarah Josepha Hale]], longtime editor of the ''[[Ladies' Magazine]]'' and co-editor of ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'', edited Flora's Interpreter in 1832; it continued in print through the 1860s. Catharine H. Waterman Esling wrote a long poem titled \"The Language of Flowers\", which first appeared in 1839 in her own language of flowers book, ''Flora's Lexicon''; it continued in print through the 1860s. Lucy Hooper, an editor, novelist, poet, and playwright, included several of her flower poems in ''The Lady's Book of Flowers and Poetry'', first published in 1841. [[Frances Sargent Osgood]], a poet and friend of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], first published ''The Poetry of Flowers and Flowers of Poetry'' in 1841, and it continued in print through the 1860s. Osgood edited a special gift book, ''The Floral Offering'', in 1847. [[Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo]], author of several flower books, was associate editor of the Universalist monthly ''[[The Ladies' Repository]]'' in [[Boston]] from 1839 to 1842. Her book, ''The Flower Vase'', was published in 1844. She edited the books ''Fables of Flora'' in 1844 and ''The Floral Fortune Teller'' in 1846. C. M. Kirtland is probably [[Caroline Matilda Kirkland]], editor of the ''Union Magazine of Literature and Art'' from 1847 to 1851 and the Unitarian weekly ''Christian Inquirer'' from 1847 to 1852. First published in 1848, Kirkland's ''Poetry of Flowers'' continued to be in print at least until 1886. One of the more comprehensive books, its 522 pages contain an extensive dictionary and numerous flower poems.[3]\n\n==Meanings==\nThe significance assigned to specific flowers in Western culture varied \u2014 nearly every flower had multiple associations, listed in the hundreds of floral dictionaries \u2014 but a consensus of meaning for common blooms has emerged.  Often, definitions derive from the appearance or behavior of the plant itself. For example, the [[mimosa]], or sensitive plant, represents chastity. This is because the leaves of the mimosa close at night, or when touched. Likewise, the deep red [[Rose (symbolism)|rose]] and its thorns have been used to symbolize both the [[blood of Christ]] and the intensity of [[romantic love]], while the rose's five petals are thought to illustrate the [[five Holy Wounds|five crucifixion wounds of Christ]].  Pink roses imply a lesser affection, white roses suggest virtue and chastity, and yellow roses stand for friendship or devotion. The [[Black rose (symbolism)|black rose]] (actually a very dark shade of red, purple, or maroon){{citation needed|date=November 2019}} has a long association with [[death]] and [[dark magic]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n\"A woman also had to be pretty precise about where she wore flowers. Say, for instance, a suitor had sent her a tussie-mussie (a k a nosegay). If she pinned it to the 'cleavage of bosom', that would be bad news for him, since that signified friendship. Ah, but if she pinned it over her heart, 'That was an unambiguous declaration of love'.\"<ref>[http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0998 A.Word.A.Day Archives], from https://wordsmith.org/awad</ref>\n\n== In literature ==\n[[William Shakespeare]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]], and children's novelist [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], among others, used the language of flowers in their writings.{{Quote box\n| quote = <poem>I know a bank where the [[Thymus vulgaris|wild thyme]] blows,\nWhere [[Primula elatior|oxlips]] and the nodding [[Viola odorata|violet]] grows,\nQuite over-canopied with luscious [[Lonicera periclymenum|woodbine]],\nWith sweet [[Rosa moschata|musk-roses]] and with [[Rosa rubiginosa|eglantine]]:\nThere sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\nLull\u2019d in these flowers with dances and delight;</poem>\n| source = \u2013 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Act 2, Scene 1\n| align = right\n}}[[File:Klavah Wilderness wildflowers.JPG|thumb|A field of wildflowers]]\nShakespeare used the word \"flower\" more than 100 times in his plays and sonnets.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of Flowers|url=http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=3192|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|accessdate=2013-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919185926/http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=3192|archive-date=2014-09-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> In ''[[Hamlet]]'', [[Ophelia]] mentions and explains the symbolic meaning of [[pansies]], [[rosemary]], [[fennel]], [[lilies]], [[Aquilegia|columbine]], [[rue]], [[daisy (disambiguation)|daisy]], and [[violet (plant)|violets]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Eriksson|first=Katarina|title=Ophelia's Flowers and Their Symbolic Meaning|url=http://huntingtonbotanical.org/Shakespeare/ophelia.htm|publisher=Huntington Botanical|accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>  In ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'',  the princess Perdita wishes that she had violets, [[daffodils]], and [[primrose (disambiguation)|primroses]] to make garlands for her friends.

John Steinbeck's short story \"[[The Chrysanthemums]]\" centers around the yellow florets, which are often associated with optimism and lost love. When the protagonist, Elisa, finds her beloved chrysanthemums tossed on the ground, her hobby and womanhood have been ruined; this suffices the themes of lost appreciation and femininity in Steinbeck's work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonestar.edu/symbolism-chrysanthemums.htm|title=Symbolism in \"The Chrysanthemums\"|website=www.lonestar.edu|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[Vanessa Diffenbaugh]] published a ''[[New York Times]]''-bestselling novel centered on floriography, ''[[The Language of Flowers (novel)|The Language of Flowers]]'', as well as her own flower dictionary.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=A Bouquet of Petals and Thorns, All Defined With Meticulous Precision|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/books/the-language-of-flowers-by-vanessa-diffenbaugh-review.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=2013-05-31|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2011-09-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the poetic anthology ''Vivere e non vivere'' (2018) by the Italian writer Sabrina Gatti, Julie, the protagonist, is identified in the Lilium or in the Hydrangea, using the language of flowers, a topic to which the same writer in 2019 dedicates an essay entitled ''Florigrafia. Il linguaggio dei fiori''.\n\n== In art ==\nSeveral [[Anglican]] churches in England have paintings, sculpture, or stained glass windows of the [[Christian symbolism#Lily crucifix|lily crucifix]], depicting Christ crucified on or holding a [[lily]]. One example is a window at [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford|The Clopton Chantry Chapel Church]] in Long Melford, Suffolk, England, UK.\n\nThe Victorian [[Pre-Raphaelites]], a group of 19th-century painters and poets who aimed to revive the purer art of the late medieval period, captured classic notions of beauty romantically. These artists are known for their idealistic portrayal of women, emphasis on nature and morality, and use of literature and mythology. Flowers laden with symbolism figure prominently in much of their work. [[John Everett Millais]], a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, used oils to create pieces filled with naturalistic elements and rich in floriography. His painting ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1852) depicts Shakespeare's drowned stargazer floating amid the flowers she describes in Act IV, Scene V of ''[[Hamlet]]''.[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] (1852) is part of the [[Tate Gallery]] collection.

I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.\" Song of Songs 2:1\u20133</ref> as an emblem for the Israelite people<ref>\"8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.  9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.  10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.  11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.  12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?  13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.  14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;  15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.  16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.\"  Psalm 80:10\u201316</ref> and for the coming Messiah.<ref>\"11 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots\" Isaiah 11:1</ref> In [[Western culture]], [[William Shakespeare]] ascribed emblematic meanings to flowers, especially in ''[[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]''. Similarly, in a scene in his [[Henry VI, Part 1]], English noblemen pick either red or white roses to symbolize their alliegance to the Houses of Lancaster or York.\n\nInterest in floriography soared in [[Victorian England]] and in the [[United States]] during the 19th century. Gifts of blooms, plants, and specific floral arrangements were used to send a coded message to the recipient, allowing the sender to express feelings which could not be spoken aloud in Victorian society.<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/languageofflower00gree | title = Language of Flowers | first = Kate | last = Greenaway | location = London | publisher = George Routledge and Sons | year = }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Tussie-Mussies: the Victorian Art of Expressing Yourself in the Language of Flowers |url=https://archive.org/details/tussiemussiesvic00lauf |url-access=registration | first = Geraldine Adamich | last = Laufer |publisher=Workman Publishing |year=1993}}</ref> Armed with floral dictionaries, Victorians often exchanged small \"talking bouquets\", called nosegays or [[tussie-mussies]], which could be worn or carried as a fashion accessory.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Floral poetry and the language of flowers (1877) (14782868105).jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''Floral poetry and the language of flowers'' (1877)]]\nAccording to Jayne Alcock, Grounds and Gardens Supervisor at [[The Walled Gardens of Cannington]], the renewed [[Victorian era]] interest in the language of flowers finds its roots in [[Ottoman Turkey]], specifically the court in [[Constantinople]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk/blog/post/?id=19|title = The Language of Flowers|website = Bridgwater College|access-date = 2016-03-29|date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> and an obsession it held with [[tulips]] during the first half of the 18th century. The Victorian use of flowers as a means of covert communication bloomed alongside a growing interest in [[botany]].\n\nThe floriography craze was introduced to Europe by two people: Englishwoman [[Mary Wortley Montagu]] (1689\u20131762), who brought it to [[England]] in 1717, and Aubry de La Mottraye (1674\u20131743), who introduced it to the Swedish court in 1727. Joseph Hammer-Purgstall's ''Dictionnaire du language des fleurs'' (1809) appears to be the first published list associating flowers with symbolic definitions, while the first dictionary of floriography appears in 1819 when Louise Cortambert, writing under pen name Madame Charlotte de la Tour, wrote ''Le langage des Fleurs''.\n\nFloriography was popularized in [[France]] during 1810\u20131850, while in Britain it was popular during the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] age (roughly 1820\u20131880), and in the [[United States]] during 1830\u20131850. La Tour's book stimulated the publishing industry especially in France, England, and the United States, but also in [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and other European countries as well as in [[South America]]. Publishers from these countries produced hundreds of editions of floriography books during the 19th century.\n\nBritish floral dictionaries include [[Henry Phillips (horticulturist)|Henry Phillips]]' ''Floral Emblems'' published in 1825 and [[Frederic Shoberl]]'s ''The Language of Flowers; With Illustrative Poetry'', in 1834. Shoberl was the editor of the popular annual \"Forget Me Not\" from 1822 to 1834. [[Robert Tyas]] was a popular British flower writer, publisher, and clergyman, who lived from 1811 to 1879; his book, ''The Sentiment of Flowers; or, Language of Flora'', first published in 1836 and printed through the 1840s, was billed as an English version of [[Charlotte de la Tour]]'s book. One of the most familiar books about floriography is Routledge's edition illustrated by [[Kate Greenaway]], ''The Language of Flowers''. First published in 1884, it continues to be reprinted to this day.\n\nIn the United States the first appearance of the language of flowers in print was in the writings of [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]], a French-American naturalist, who wrote on-going features under the title \"The School of Flora\", from 1827 through 1828, in the weekly [[Saturday Evening Post]] and the monthly ''Casket; or Flowers of Literature, Wit, and Sentiment''. These pieces contained the botanic, English, and French names of the plant, a description of the plant, an explanation of its Latin names, and the flower's emblematic meaning. However, the first books on floriography were [[Elizabeth Wirt]]'s ''Flora's Dictionary'' and [[Dorothea Dix]]'s ''The Garland of Flora'', both of which were published in 1829, though Wirt's book had been issued in an unauthorized edition in 1828.\n\nDuring its peak in the United States, the language of flowers attracted the attention of popular female writers and editors. [[Sarah Josepha Hale]], longtime editor of the ''[[Ladies' Magazine]]'' and co-editor of ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'', edited Flora's Interpreter in 1832; it continued in print through the 1860s. Catharine H. Waterman Esling wrote a long poem titled \"The Language of Flowers\", which first appeared in 1839 in her own language of flowers book, ''Flora's Lexicon''; it continued in print through the 1860s. Lucy Hooper, an editor, novelist, poet, and playwright, included several of her flower poems in ''The Lady's Book of Flowers and Poetry'', first published in 1841. [[Frances Sargent Osgood]], a poet and friend of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], first published ''The Poetry of Flowers and Flowers of Poetry'' in 1841, and it continued in print through the 1860s. Osgood edited a special gift book, ''The Floral Offering'', in 1847. [[Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo]], author of several flower books, was associate editor of the Universalist monthly ''[[The Ladies' Repository]]'' in [[Boston]] from 1839 to 1842. Her book, ''The Flower Vase'', was published in 1844. She edited the books ''Fables of Flora'' in 1844 and ''The Floral Fortune Teller'' in 1846. C. M. Kirtland is probably [[Caroline Matilda Kirkland]], editor of the ''Union Magazine of Literature and Art'' from 1847 to 1851 and the Unitarian weekly ''Christian Inquirer'' from 1847 to 1852. First published in 1848, Kirkland's ''Poetry of Flowers'' continued to be in print at least until 1886. One of the more comprehensive books, its 522 pages contain an extensive dictionary and numerous flower poems.[3]\n\n==Meanings==\nThe significance assigned to specific flowers in Western culture varied \u2014 nearly every flower had multiple associations, listed in the hundreds of floral dictionaries \u2014 but a consensus of meaning for common blooms has emerged.  Often, definitions derive from the appearance or behavior of the plant itself. For example, the [[mimosa]], or sensitive plant, represents chastity. This is because the leaves of the mimosa close at night, or when touched. Likewise, the deep red [[Rose (symbolism)|rose]] and its thorns have been used to symbolize both the [[blood of Christ]] and the intensity of [[romantic love]], while the rose's five petals are thought to illustrate the [[five Holy Wounds|five crucifixion wounds of Christ]].  Pink roses imply a lesser affection, white roses suggest virtue and chastity, and yellow roses stand for friendship or devotion. The [[Black rose (symbolism)|black rose]] (actually a very dark shade of red, purple, or maroon){{citation needed|date=November 2019}} has a long association with [[death]] and [[dark magic]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n\"A woman also had to be pretty precise about where she wore flowers. Say, for instance, a suitor had sent her a tussie-mussie (a k a nosegay). If she pinned it to the 'cleavage of bosom', that would be bad news for him, since that signified friendship. Ah, but if she pinned it over her heart, 'That was an unambiguous declaration of love'.\"<ref>[http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0998 A.Word.A.Day Archives], from https://wordsmith.org/awad</ref>\n\n== In literature ==\n[[William Shakespeare]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]], and children's novelist [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], among others, used the language of flowers in their writings.{{Quote box\n| quote = <poem>I know a bank where the [[Thymus vulgaris|wild thyme]] blows,\nWhere [[Primula elatior|oxlips]] and the nodding [[Viola odorata|violet]] grows,\nQuite over-canopied with luscious [[Lonicera periclymenum|woodbine]],\nWith sweet [[Rosa moschata|musk-roses]] and with [[Rosa rubiginosa|eglantine]]:\nThere sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\nLull\u2019d in these flowers with dances and delight;</poem>\n| source = \u2013 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Act 2, Scene 1\n| align = right\n}}[[File:Klavah Wilderness wildflowers.JPG|thumb|A field of wildflowers]]\nShakespeare used the word \"flower\" more than 100 times in his plays and sonnets.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of Flowers|url=http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=3192|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|accessdate=2013-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919185926/http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=3192|archive-date=2014-09-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> In ''[[Hamlet]]'', [[Ophelia]] mentions and explains the symbolic meaning of [[pansies]], [[rosemary]], [[fennel]], [[lilies]], [[Aquilegia|columbine]], [[rue]], [[daisy (disambiguation)|daisy]], and [[violet (plant)|violets]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Eriksson|first=Katarina|title=Ophelia's Flowers and Their Symbolic Meaning|url=http://huntingtonbotanical.org/Shakespeare/ophelia.htm|publisher=Huntington Botanical|accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>  In ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'',  the princess Perdita wishes that she had violets, [[daffodils]], and [[primrose (disambiguation)|primroses]] to make garlands for her friends.

John Steinbeck's short story \"[[The Chrysanthemums]]\" centers around the yellow florets, which are often associated with optimism and lost love. When the protagonist, Elisa, finds her beloved chrysanthemums tossed on the ground, her hobby and womanhood have been ruined; this suffices the themes of lost appreciation and femininity in Steinbeck's work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonestar.edu/symbolism-chrysanthemums.htm|title=Symbolism in \"The Chrysanthemums\"|website=www.lonestar.edu|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[Vanessa Diffenbaugh]] published a ''[[New York Times]]''-bestselling novel centered on floriography, ''[[The Language of Flowers (novel)|The Language of Flowers]]'', as well as her own flower dictionary.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=A Bouquet of Petals and Thorns, All Defined With Meticulous Precision|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/books/the-language-of-flowers-by-vanessa-diffenbaugh-review.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=2013-05-31|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2011-09-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the poetic anthology ''Vivere e non vivere'' (2018) by the Italian writer Sabrina Gatti, Julie, the protagonist, is identified in the Lilium or in the Hydrangea, using the language of flowers, a topic to which the same writer in 2019 dedicates an essay entitled ''Florigrafia.

These artists are known for their idealistic portrayal of women, emphasis on nature and morality, and use of literature and mythology. Flowers laden with symbolism figure prominently in much of their work. [[John Everett Millais]], a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, used oils to create pieces filled with naturalistic elements and rich in floriography. His painting ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1852) depicts Shakespeare's drowned stargazer floating amid the flowers she describes in Act IV, Scene V of ''[[Hamlet]]''.[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] (1852) is part of the [[Tate Gallery]] collection.

S. Johar]], ''Chandni Chowk''. Naeem Hashmi was hero of this movie and Erika Rukhshi was the heroine. Just as the production of film was to start, riots broke out in [[Lahore]] and he and his family had to flee from the city. After the [[partition of India]] into [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, he moved to [[Delhi]]. He later moved to [[Mumbai]], where his first production, ''Karwat'', began in 1948, though it turned out to be a flop. His first film as a director, ''Afsana'', was released in 1951 and featured [[Ashok Kumar]] in a double role&nbsp;\u2013 the film was a hit and established his name in [[Bollywood]]. Chopra made ''[[Chandni Chowk (film)|Chandni Chowk]]'', with [[Meena Kumari]] as a lead, in 1954. In 1955, Chopra formed his own production house, ''B.R Films''. His first movie for this production house was Ek hi Raasta which was highly successful''he followed it up with [[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]]'' (1957) starring [[Dilip Kumar]] and [[Vyjayantimala Bali]], the film became a golden jubilee hit.His subsequent releases like [[Kanoon]], [[Gumrah (1963 film)|Gumrah]], [[Humraaz]] were major hits in the sixties.  In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"berlinale 1963\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1963/04_jury_1963/04_Jury_1963.html |title=Berlinale: Juries |accessdate=13 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329093651/http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1963/04_jury_1963/04_Jury_1963.html| archivedate= 29 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> His second film with actor Dilip Kumar was [[Dastaan (1972 film)|Dastaan]] which became a flop in 1972.\n\nHe directed successful film across genres after 1972, with films like suspense thriller [[Dhund (1973 film)|Dhund]], drama [[Karma]] (1977), comedy film [[Pati Patni Aur Woh]], crime film in [[Insaaf Ka Tarazu]], Muslim social in ''Nikaah'' and the  political thriller [[Awam (film)|Awam]].\n\nHe was the producer for the films [[Dhool Ka Phool]], [[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]], [[Aadmi Aur Insaan]] and [[Ittefaq (1969 film)|Ittefaq]] directed by his younger brother Yash Chopra, and he also produced [[The Burning Train]], [[Aaj Ki Awaaz]],  [[Mazdoor]], [[Baghban]], [[Baabul]],[[Bhootnath]] which were directed by [[Ravi Chopra]].\n\nChopra was instrumental in developing the career of singer [[Mahendra Kapoor]], whom he employed in most of his movies. (Director-producer [[Yash Chopra]] cast Mahendra Kapoor's son in ''Faasle''.) One prominent thing about B. R. Chopra is the relatively low number of songs sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Mohammed Rafi]] in his films, with [[Asha Bhosle]] and [[Mahendra Kapoor]] being his preferred singers. The reason behind this was never revealed by him or the singers. Incidentally, both Chopra and Kapoor died within a gap of little longer than a month in 2008, with the latter dying first.\n\nChopra forayed into television with ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'', one of the most successful TV serials in Indian television history, where [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] played the role of [[Lord Krishna|Krishna]] and this was co-directed by him with his son.

He was [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] for this parliament. He was later [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]]  and [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice of the King's Bench]].\n\n==Background and early life==\nRichardson was born at [[Hardwick, Norfolk|Hardwick]], Depwade Hundred, [[Norfolk]], and was baptised there on 3 July 1569, the son of William Richardson whose family were said to be descended from the younger son of a Norman family, John, who moved to county Durham in about 1100.

In 1614, he was [[Lent Reader]] at Lincoln's Inn, and on 13 October of the same year became [[serjeant-at-law]].

The excuses which he made before accepting this office appear to have been more than formal, for an eye-witness reports that he 'wept downright.' On 25 March 1621 he was knighted at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] when he brought King James congratulations of the commons upon the recent censure of Sir [[Giles Mompesson]]. In the chair he proved a veritable [[King Log]] and his term of office was marked by the degradation of [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]. He was not re-elected to parliament in the next election.\n\n==Judicial advancement==\nOn 20 February 1625 Richardson was made [[serjeant-at-law|king's serjeant]]. On 28 November 1626 he succeeded [[Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Hobart]] as [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], after a vacancy of nearly a year. His advancement was said to have cost him \u00a317,000 and his second marriage (see infra). He judged on 13 November 1628, that it was illegal to use the rack to elicit confession from [[John Felton (assassin)|Felton]], the murderer of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham's]]. His opinion had the concurrence of his colleagues and marks a significant point in the history of English criminal jurisprudence. In the following December he presided at the trial of three of the [[Jesuits]] arrested in [[Clerkenwell]], and secured the acquittal of two of them by requiring proof, which was not forthcoming, of their orders.\n\nIn the same year he took part in the careful review of the law of [[constructive treason]] This arose from the case of Hugh Pine who was charged with that crime for [[L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9|speaking words that were derogatory to the king's majesty]]. The result of Richardsons's review was to limit the offence to cases of imagining the king's death. He concurred in the guarded and somewhat evasive opinion on the extent of privilege of parliament which the [[Charles I of England|king]] elicited from the judges after the turbulent scenes which preceded the dissolution of parliament on 4 March 1629. He was as lenient as he could be when he imposed a fine of \u00a3500 without imprisonment in the case of Richard Chambers, and his agreement with harsh sentences passed upon [[Alexander Leighton]] and [[William Prynne]] may have been dictated by timidity, and there contrast strongly with the tenderness which he showed [[Henry Sherfield]], the iconoclastic bencher of Lincoln's Inn.\n\n==Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench==\n[[File:Memorial to Sir Thomas Richardson by James Cole, c 1720.png|thumb|Memorial to Sir Thomas Richardson, Westminster Abbey.]]\nRichardson was advanced to the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|chief-justiceship of the king's bench]] on 24 October 1631, and served on the [[Circuit court|western circuit]]. He was not a [[puritan]] but in Lent 1632 he made and order, at the instance of the [[Somerset]] magistrates, for  suppressing the 'wakes' or Sunday revels, which were a fertile source of crime in the county. He directed the order to be read in church and this brought him into conflict with [[William Laud|Laud]], who sent for him and told him it was the king's pleasure he should rescind the order. Richardson ignored this instruction until the [[Charles I of England|king]] himself repeated it. He then, at the ensuing summer [[Assizes]] (1633), laid the matter fairly before the justices and grand jury, professing his inability to comply with the royal mandate on the ground that the order had been made by the joint consent of the whole bench, and was in fact a mere confirmation and enlargement of similar orders made in the county since the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], all which he substantiated from the county records. This caused him to be cited before the council, reprimanded, and transferred to the Essex circuit. 'I am like,' he muttered as he left the council board, 'to be choked with the archbishop's lawn sleeves.'\n\nRichardson died at his house in [[Chancery Lane]] on 4 February 1635 and was buried  in the north aisle of the choir of [[Westminster Abbey]], beneath a marble monument. There is a bust by [[Hubert Le Sueur]].\n\n==Judicial reputation==\nRichardson was a capable lawyer and a weak man, much addicted to flouts and jeers. 'Let him have the ''[[Book of Martyrs]]''' he said, when the question whether [[William Prynne|Prynne]] should be allowed the use of books was before the court; 'for the puritans do account him a martyr.' He could also make a caustic jest at his own expense. 'You see now\u2019 he dryly remarked, as he avoided a missile aimed at him by a condemned felon by stooping low, 'if I had been an upright judge I had been slain.' He possessed some polite learning, which caused [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]], the water poet, to dedicate to him one of the impressions of his ''Superbiae Flagellum'' (1621).\n\n==Family and posterity==\nRichardson married twice. His first wife, Ursula Southwell was the third daughter of John Southwell of [[Barham, Suffolk|Barham]] Hall, [[Suffolk]]. She was buried at [[St Andrew, Holborn|St. Andrew's, Holborn]], on 13 June 1624. His second wife, married at [[St Giles in the Fields]], Middlesex, on 14 December 1626, was [[Elizabeth Richardson, 1st Lady Cramond|Elizabeth]]  widow of Sir John Ashburnham and daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont of [[Stoughton, Leicestershire]]. She was the first [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham's]] maternal second cousin once removed.\n\nRichardson had twelve children by his first wife, of whom four daughters and one son, Thomas, survived him. By his second wife he had no issue. She was created on 28 February 1629 [[Lord Cramond|Lady Cramond]] in the peerage of [[Scotland]], for life, with remainder to her stepson, Sir Thomas Richardson, K.B. Sir Thomas died in her lifetime on 12 March 1645 and his son Thomas succeeded to the peerage on her death in April 1651. The title became extinct by the death, without issue, of William, the fifth lord, in 1735.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.thepeerage.com/p2672.htm#i26712 \"Sir Thomas Richardson\"] at ThePeerage.com\n\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Richardson, Thomas (1569-1635)}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last1=Harries|first1=R.|last2=Cattermole|first2=P.|last3=Mackintosh|first3=P.|title=A History of Norwich School: King Edward VI's Grammar School at Norwich|year=1991|location=Norwich|publisher=Friends of Norwich School|isbn=978-0-9518561-1-6}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Find a Grave|20917}}\n* {{UK National Archives ID}}\n* {{NPG name|name=Sir Thomas Richardson}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|en}}\n{{succession box \n| title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[St Albans (UK Parliament constituency)|St Albans]] \n| before=  [[Thomas Perient]]\n| before2= [[Henry Finch (died 1625)|Henry Finch]]\n| with= [[Robert Shute (died 1621)|Robert Shute]] 1620\u20131621\n| with2= [[Henry Meautys]] 1621\u20131622\n| years=1620\u20131622\n| after=  [[Arthur Capell (1585-1653)|Sir Arthur Capell]]\n| after2= [[John Luke (MP)|Sir John Luke]]\n}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Speaker of the British House of Commons]]\n  | years  = 1621&ndash;1622\n  | before = [[Randolph Crewe|Sir Randolph Crewe]]\n  | after  = [[Thomas Crewe|Sir Thomas Crewe]]\n}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{succession box \n  | title = [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]]\n  | years = 1626&ndash;1631\n  | before = [[Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Hobart]]\n  | after = [[Sir Robert Heath]]\n}}\n{{succession box \n  | title = [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]]\n  | years = 1631&ndash;1635\n  | before = [[Nicholas Hyde|Sir Nicholas Hyde]]\n  | after = [[John Brampston|Sir John Brampston]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Speaker of the British House of Commons}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Richardson, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1569 births]]\n[[Category:1635 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Common Pleas]]\n[[Category:Speakers of the House of Commons of England]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1621\u20131622]]\n[[Category:Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:People educated at Norwich School]]\n[[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n[[Category:People from South Norfolk (district)]]\n[[Category:People of the Tudor period]]\n[[Category:16th-century English judges]]\n[[Category:17th-century English judges]]\n[[Category:People from Norwich]]\n[[Category:People from Honingham]]\n", "text_old": "{{other people|Thomas Richardson}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:SirThomasRichardsonCrop.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Thomas Richardson.]]\n'''Sir Thomas Richardson''' (1569 \u2013 4 February 1635) was an English judge and politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] from 1621 to 1622.

Given the large number programs on which the money is spent, the CPSMS is an initiative by the Indian Central Government to ensure that the money is spent according to its intended purpose, and provide an accounting of same. The main Engineer Behind PFMS is \"Sameer Jaiswal\".\n\n==History==\nThe Economic Survey (2007\u201308) emphasized the need for effective financial monitoring of the Plan Schemes. The Finance Minister in his Budget Speech (2008\u201309) announced<ref>[http://gscurrentaffairs.com/gk/central-plan-schemes-monitoring-system-cpsms/ Announcement of CPSMS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929220209/http://gscurrentaffairs.com/gk/central-plan-schemes-monitoring-system-cpsms/ |date=September 29, 2010 }}</ref> the establishment of a comprehensive Decision Support System and Management Information System. The 11th Plan Document also recognized the deficiencies in the existing accounting system for the Plan Schemes and its inability to support informed planning, budgeting and effective monitoring of these schemes. It also underlined the need for a consolidated financial information system for the Plan Schemes.\n\nThe EFC of the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] has approved the implementation of CPSMS in a phased manner. The Finance Minister has also accorded its approval in principle for the entire scheme. Administrative and financial approval for Part A of the Scheme, with an outlay of Rs. 24.25 crores, has also been received. <ref>[http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/International_Confereence33.pdf Presentation at Planning Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165712/http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/International_Confereence33.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/Plan_Scheme_Monitoring_Project_of_GOI.pdf Development of a Management Information & Decision Support System for Plan Schemes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721170333/http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/Plan_Scheme_Monitoring_Project_of_GOI.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nBy 2009, The system was available in all the central ministries and all the state, ministry and scheme reports were available to users in these ministries. The system was being implemented in the four states of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. The CPSMS-CBS interface was functional and was providing real time information exchange with the banks. The Planning Commission also decided to fast-track work on the system.<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/planning-commission-fast-tracks-scheme-to-monitor-social-projects/20/28/364279/ Planning Commission fast-tracks scheme to monitor social projects]</ref>\n\n=== 2009-10 ===\nBy the 2009-18 financial year the CPSMS had made significant strides since its initial roll out. The dedicated web portal of CPSMS was operational and had registered more than 8.00 lakhs hits. All the Plan Schemes of Civil Ministries have been mapped and about 75,000 Sanctions were issued. All releases from the Government of India under Plan Schemes were now made through CPSMS, and all agencies receiving these releases were registered on the CPSMS Portal. More than 800,000 agencies have been registered. Ministry, Scheme, State-wise, District, NGO, Individual data of releases from GOI are available centrally on CPSMS in real time. The CPSMS data is fully reconciled with the accounting data of Controller General of Accounts.\n\nCentral Plan Scheme Monitoring System has successfully integrated with the Core Banking Solution (CBS) of 150 banks all over India. It includes the Public Sector Banks, major Private Sector Banks.\n\nCPSMS has also won the Microsoft Developer Innovation & Excellence Award 2009 <ref>[http://www.windowsfs.com/special-features/windows-in-financial-services-developer-awards-3 Windows in Financial Services Developer Awards 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006063909/http://www.windowsfs.com/special-features/windows-in-financial-services-developer-awards-3 |date=October 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.windowsfs.com/uncategorized/state-bank-of-india-wins-developer-award-for-central-plan-scheme-monitoring-system State Bank of India Wins Developer Award for Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819125403/http://www.windowsfs.com/uncategorized/state-bank-of-india-wins-developer-award-for-central-plan-scheme-monitoring-system |date=August 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe CPSMS after successfully completing the pilots has started Pilots on E-Payments to beneficiaries under various social sector schemes leveraging its CPSMS-CBS interface. Thus it provides a platform for the schemes for making payments directly in the bank accounts of beneficiaries.\n\nPlanning Commission, Government of India has issued, Office Memorandum, making CPSMS mandatory for Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme of Government of India. CPSMS serves as the central MIS for all DBT transactions.\n\n==Why CPSMS==\nThere are over 1045 plans being implemented in the priority social sector, aimed at millions of beneficiaries across India, through the different ministries of the central government of India. Moreover, the Central Government also releases funds under Additional Central Assistance program to states to use within their region.

Given the large number programs on which the money is spent, the CPSMS is an initiative by the Indian Central Government to ensure that the money is spent according to its intended purpose, and provide an accounting of same. The main Engineer Behind PFMS is \"Sameer Jaiswal\".\n\n==History==\nThe Economic Survey (2007\u201308) emphasized the need for effective financial monitoring of the Plan Schemes. The Finance Minister in his Budget Speech (2008\u201309) announced<ref>[http://gscurrentaffairs.com/gk/central-plan-schemes-monitoring-system-cpsms/ Announcement of CPSMS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929220209/http://gscurrentaffairs.com/gk/central-plan-schemes-monitoring-system-cpsms/ |date=September 29, 2010 }}</ref> the establishment of a comprehensive Decision Support System and Management Information System. The 11th Plan Document also recognized the deficiencies in the existing accounting system for the Plan Schemes and its inability to support informed planning, budgeting and effective monitoring of these schemes. It also underlined the need for a consolidated financial information system for the Plan Schemes.\n\nThe EFC of the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] has approved the implementation of CPSMS in a phased manner. The Finance Minister has also accorded its approval in principle for the entire scheme. Administrative and financial approval for Part A of the Scheme, with an outlay of Rs. 24.25 crores, has also been received. <ref>[http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/International_Confereence33.pdf Presentation at Planning Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165712/http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/International_Confereence33.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/Plan_Scheme_Monitoring_Project_of_GOI.pdf Development of a Management Information & Decision Support System for Plan Schemes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721170333/http://www.cga.nic.in/pdf/Plan_Scheme_Monitoring_Project_of_GOI.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nBy 2009, The system was available in all the central ministries and all the state, ministry and scheme reports were available to users in these ministries. The system was being implemented in the four states of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. The CPSMS-CBS interface was functional and was providing real time information exchange with the banks. The Planning Commission also decided to fast-track work on the system.<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/planning-commission-fast-tracks-scheme-to-monitor-social-projects/20/28/364279/ Planning Commission fast-tracks scheme to monitor social projects]</ref>\n\n=== 2009-10 ===\nBy the 2009-18 financial year the CPSMS had made significant strides since its initial roll out. The dedicated web portal of CPSMS was operational and had registered more than 8.00 lakhs hits. All the Plan Schemes of Civil Ministries have been mapped and about 75,000 Sanctions were issued. All releases from the Government of India under Plan Schemes were now made through CPSMS, and all agencies receiving these releases were registered on the CPSMS Portal. More than 800,000 agencies have been registered. Ministry, Scheme, State-wise, District, NGO, Individual data of releases from GOI are available centrally on CPSMS in real time. The CPSMS data is fully reconciled with the accounting data of Controller General of Accounts.\n\nCentral Plan Scheme Monitoring System has successfully integrated with the Core Banking Solution (CBS) of 150 banks all over India. It includes the Public Sector Banks, major Private Sector Banks.\n\nCPSMS has also won the Microsoft Developer Innovation & Excellence Award 2009 <ref>[http://www.windowsfs.com/special-features/windows-in-financial-services-developer-awards-3 Windows in Financial Services Developer Awards 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006063909/http://www.windowsfs.com/special-features/windows-in-financial-services-developer-awards-3 |date=October 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.windowsfs.com/uncategorized/state-bank-of-india-wins-developer-award-for-central-plan-scheme-monitoring-system State Bank of India Wins Developer Award for Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819125403/http://www.windowsfs.com/uncategorized/state-bank-of-india-wins-developer-award-for-central-plan-scheme-monitoring-system |date=August 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe CPSMS after successfully completing the pilots has started Pilots on E-Payments to beneficiaries under various social sector schemes leveraging its CPSMS-CBS interface. Thus it provides a platform for the schemes for making payments directly in the bank accounts of beneficiaries.\n\nPlanning Commission, Government of India has issued, Office Memorandum, making CPSMS mandatory for Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme of Government of India. CPSMS serves as the central MIS for all DBT transactions.\n\n==Why CPSMS==\nThere are over 1045 plans being implemented in the priority social sector, aimed at millions of beneficiaries across India, through the different ministries of the central government of India.
