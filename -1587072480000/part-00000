In the 1670s the [[Etiwan tribe|Etiwan]] moved to the area to escape the [[Westo]], seeking protection among the plantations of early colonists who were often referred to as the \"Goose Creek men\", mostly settled a few miles north of Charleston near a stream called Goose Creek, a tributary of the Cooper River. The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]], while later the [[deerskin trade]] dominated. Several colonial governors were Goose Creek men, such as [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]] and [[Robert Daniell]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A colonial complex: South Carolina's frontiers in the era of the Yamasee War, 1680\u20131730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |isbn= 0-8032-3575-5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofgoosecreek.com/?id=75668&action=detail&catID=15201&parentID=15195  Overview of the History of Goose Creek], City of Goose Creek.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 29 | pages = 1\u201325, 71\u201396, 167\u201392, 265\u201379 | last = Smith | first = Henry A.

During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902\u20131996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.\n\nDuring this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]].

In the 1670s the [[Etiwan tribe|Etiwan]] moved to the area to escape the [[Westo]], seeking protection among the plantations of early colonists who were often referred to as the \"Goose Creek men\", mostly settled a few miles north of Charleston near a stream called Goose Creek, a tributary of the Cooper River. The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]], while later the [[deerskin trade]] dominated. Several colonial governors were Goose Creek men, such as [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]] and [[Robert Daniell]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A colonial complex: South Carolina's frontiers in the era of the Yamasee War, 1680\u20131730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |isbn= 0-8032-3575-5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofgoosecreek.com/?id=75668&action=detail&catID=15201&parentID=15195  Overview of the History of Goose Creek], City of Goose Creek.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 29 | pages = 1\u201325, 71\u201396, 167\u201392, 265\u201379 | last = Smith | first = Henry A.

During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902\u20131996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.\n\nDuring this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]].
